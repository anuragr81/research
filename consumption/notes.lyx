Demand Analysis - Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marketing and supply concerns have been ignored for the current stage
 of the study.
 The study of demand encompasses the household surveys in Tanzania and UK
 - inspecting the income elasticities of chosen commodities.
 The analysis focuses on Engel curves for the commodities and temporarily
 avoids the time-series analysis of incomes and prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Cross Section Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a population is observed for a sufficiently long time, then we can understand
 the effects of changing incomes, price variations on their choices.
 A significant degree of demand analysis from panel data comes out of the
 Slutsky equation approach (e.g.
 the well-known AIDS model - a particular version of the Rotterdam model).
 With no time-series data, on the other hand, one relies on price-variations
 within the cross-section and interpretations of commodity-elasticities
 (instead of effects of changing income on a monitored household).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By adding more parameters to the semi-logarithmic model, one runs the risk
 of overfitting.
 It is easy, in other words, to stress on transient parameters in a given
 cross-sectional snapshot.
 The calibration of a cost-function and imposition of general conditions
 on the demand equations can get around some of these problems.

Analysis by Prais-Houthakker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Houthakker attributes the popularity of Engel curves to the idea of equivalence
 scales (i.e.
 how different households achieve same level of living standard).
 Although Houthakker's Engel fitting would now be considered unashamedly
 pragmatic 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, his research was influential in popularising the use of income and expenditure
 elasticities in cross-sectional analyses

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest Engel curves are set up with the Woking-Leser model hitherto
 used in the study:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{i}=\beta\cdot log\ x_{i}+\alpha
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, budget share total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

, budget share
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$
\end_inset

 are regression coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A noticeable shortcoming with the Woking-Leser model is that no commodity
 specific information is used in the semi-logarithmic equation.
 The current study attempts to enhance this model with household and geographic
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cost Function and the Gorman Model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gorman approach considers a more general Engel curve: 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\sum_{r\epsilon R}a_{ir}(p)\Phi_{r}(ln(x))$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is a finite set and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{r}(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 are general functions).
 For these to be consistent, one arrives at the cost function: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\ ln\ c(u,p)}{\partial\ ln\ p_{i}}=\sum_{r\epsilon R}a_{ir}(p)\Phi_{r}\{ln\ c(u,p)\}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $u=$
\end_inset

utility, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=$
\end_inset

price).
 Gorman derives following restrictions on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{n}(\cdot)$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
w_{i} & =a_{i}(p)+b_{i}(p)ln\ x+d_{i}(p)\sum_{m=1}^{M}\gamma_{m}(p)(ln\ x)^{m}
\end{align}

 Muellbauer has enhanced the model by considering every household a multiple

 One considers a multiplicative index 
\begin_inset Formula $m(a^{h},u^{h})$
\end_inset

 The clustering effect was not found significant for cheaper commodities.

\begin_layout Section
Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current study notes elasticity differences between expensive and less-expens
ive varieties - leaving us with quality-elasticities.
 However, at this point, a correlation of these elasticities with perceived
 conspicuous consumption, although methodical, is a rather subjective exercise.
 This is intended to be improved with a more robust utility-theory based
 approach (research by Ireland

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Towards that goal, I intend to develop methods to test separability in the
 context of conspicuous consumption - instead of assuming weak-separability
 of different commodity groups.
 The index prices obtained for these commodity groups are planned to be
 used for better estimates on expenditure elasticities.

 There are local factors that tend to stand out in developing countries
 - e.g.
 funeral expenditures in Swaziland.
 There is ample evidence to show that other commodities compete with welfare-rel
ated commodities (e.g.
 healthy food or financial investments).
 Banerjee et al.
 do not attribute this to temptation - but to lack of health insurance and
 sufficient cash (letting medicines and maintenance of work become more
 important than children's education or healthy food).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also worth noting that often times consumption on products/services
 that provide welfare could be less just because the quality of these services
 is extremely low in developing countries (e.g.
 education provided by the public sector).

In observed social changes, clustering based on religion or social groups
 is found significant in consumer behaviour (e.g.
 In India, muslims are influenced more by other muslims and hindus in the

\begin_layout Standard
The theory of impatience, despite its appeal, makes less sense for the poor
 and is considered irrelevant for the current study - since the evidence
 shows that poor tend to make choices as rational as their richer counterparts.
 Moderate success of microfinance (despite concerns with credit monitoring
 and administration) offers one such instance.
 Against the intuition, the poor seem to have sufficient hunger for saving
 methods and go the extra mile to save for future (even though saving is
 far more stressful for them).

 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism is inherent in all exchange of goods and services (including

 The model is of remarkable simplicity but calibrating it involves a sensitivity

 is hardly trivial.
 A study by Heffetz

 using this model involved surveying a few hundreds of respondents asking
 them - quite literally - just how visible every item is for a typical consumer

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A survey quantifies a lot of complex interations in what constitutes status
 competitions in a society.
 A luxury item - for example - needs to be marketed as a luxury for it to
 both impart visible signals to others and to improve self-perception of
 the buyer.
 In Veblen's original framework, for a product to indicate status it must
 be rare and superfluous (thus serve as an exploit).
 That a watch is more noticeable than an insurance policy (and associated
 with higher income) is not entirely relevant to this framework.
 Moreover, whether a poor person buying a cheap watch and a richer person
 buying a watch that is far more expensive (and probably subject to import
 restrictions) are both instances of conspicuous consumption or not depends
 on the context that the observer chooses.
 Cheap watches may or may not constitute conspicuous consumption - depending
 on the social welfare function.
 The wide variety of criteria in conscpicous consumption seem to indicate
 this ambiguity (See Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of visible and non-visible goods matters more in developing markets
 where a culture of mass consumerism is only nascent and status competitions
 aren't driven by economic inequalities alone (whereas in developed markets,
 firms are quick to turn a conspicuous item into a higher-priced commodity).
 The context of exploits identified by Veblen is however still relevant

 If status were imparted by inherited wealth alone, there would be little

 In the developed world, where markets have evolved to address the demands

 forces - thus a preference for visible goods indicates a higher price on
 them and a higher consumption on visible products always

 In underdeveloped markets, where information asymmetries are abound, the

Imagine that you meet a new person who lives in a household similar to yours.
 Imagine that their household is not different from other similar households,
 except that they like to, and do, spend more than average on [jewelryand
 watches].
 Would you notice this about them, and if so, for how long would you have
 to have known them, to notice it? Would you notice it almost immediately
 upon meeting them for the first time, a short while after, a while after,
 only a long while after, or never?

 Responses were coded from 1 (almost immediately) to 5 (never).
 The question was repeated for each expenditure category (randomly ordered).
 A normalized measure was then used as the visibility index.

\end_inset

.
 The visibility index computed from survey responses was found to have a
 significant predictive power for total expenditure elasticity.

The utility function is modeled as a combination of a private consumption
 function and an observable consumption function.
 Considering the Cobb-Douglas utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)=\beta_{v}\cdot f(v,w)+\beta_{w}ln(w)$
\end_inset

 over constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $y=v+w$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is the budget constraint and 
\begin_inset Formula $(v$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $w)$
\end_inset

 are visible and non-visible good quantities respectively.
 Instead of the standard Engle curve model : 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\frac{{\beta}}{1+\beta}y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\frac{{1}}{1+\beta}y$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{{\beta_{v}}}{\beta_{w}})$
\end_inset

, the authors use the model provided by Ireland et al (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

).
 Using an individual's sensitivity to social status signals in the model,
 they use a utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)f(v,w)+af(\hat{v},\hat{w})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{v},\hat{w}$
\end_inset

 are societies' view of the consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

).
 Solving for a separating equilibrium, this results in 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{{1+\beta}}{a+\beta}+Cv^{-\frac{{\beta}}{a}}(a>0)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\frac{{a}}{a+\beta}(\frac{\beta}{1+\beta})^{\frac{{\beta}}{a}}b^{\frac{{a+\beta}}{a}}$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is derived by considering the  utility maximization at lowest income level
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 as the boundary condition for the utility maximization problem).
 Elasticities in this model are 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{v}=\frac{{dv}}{dy}\cdot\frac{{y}}{v}=a((1+\beta)\frac{{v}}{y}-\beta)^{-1}$
\end_inset

.

 Robustness tests (regressions for different quantiles and across multiple

 ask two key questions to respondents in an online survey conducted in India.
 First asked them how closely they needed to interact with their neighbour
 (with similar demographic characteristics) in order to observe above average
 spending for a list of items (Options were -‘1: No Interaction’, ‘2: Occasional
 Interaction’, ‘3: Friend’, ‘4: Close Friend’ or ‘5: No matter how much
 one Interacts’).
 An item where >20% respondents report 1 or 2 was considered a visible item.
 A second question asked them what they'll expect of the consumption of
 an item after a sudden 20 percent rise in their neighbor's income ‘1: Fall’,
 ‘2: Stay the same’, ‘3: Increase by less than 20 percent’, ‘4: Increase
 by 20 percent’ or ‘5: Increase by more than 20 percent’.
 The list of items in these questions attempted to match the consumption
 categories in the IHDS.
 An item is associated with higher income if more than 20% of respondents
 reported 2,3,4 or 5.

 Visibility is a socio-cultural judgment - and the visibility basket from
 the developed world cannot be translated as such into disparate geographies
 and cultural environments of the developing world.
 One can arrive at wrong conclusions on visibile consumption for a consumer
 group if a visiblity basket was chosen from a different cultural environment.
 For example, hair-products may be associated with a higher visibility (and
 promise) in the developed world but in the developing world their purpose
 could be just utilitarian (poor quality of production, cultural factors
 etc.).
 Attributing lower visible consumption based on a low consumption of hair-produc
ts would thus be erroneous.

Another practical problem arises in the developing world because of the
 predominant use of recall method in expenditure survey.
 A relevant anomaly is the Deaton Paxson paradox(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonPaxsonParadox"

\end_inset

) - i.e.
 the observed decrease in food expenditure per head as household size rises
 (with constant outlay per head).
 The likely cause for the paradox is presence of errors correlated with
 household size in the data that results in possible overestimation of the
 consumption of recalled items
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Caution must therefore be taken (or a correction applied) when mixing expenditu
res from recall and diary methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the visibility elasticities may not be compared across countries without
 above considerations but a comparison within the country can provide insights
 into the effect of certain demographic factors on visible consumption.
 This has been the central theme for most of the studies surveyed in this
 note.
 More than to improve the mesurement of visibility, the studies are interested
 in identifying the demographic parameters that explain the log-expenditure
 of visibilty basket as is.
 The general regression equation for such a study is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (accumulated over the chosen visibility basket), 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure.
 Households with higher total expenditure are far more likely to be those
 with higher visible expenditure.
 Thus, total expenditure (on the right side of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lnvis_regression"

\end_inset

) makes it an endogenous variable for the dependent varaible : 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(vis_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 A different approach is taken by Jaikumar et al who use weights in the
 basket rather than visible expenditure levels - so that visible expenditure
 is not subject to the endogeneity problem that arises due to total expenditure
 being on the right hand side and visible expenditure on left hand side
 of the equation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"

\end_inset

 (The proportion of visible expenditure with respect to the total expenditure
 could be the same for those with higher total expenditure and lower total
 expenditure).
 However, since data on income is often poor or sparse in the developing
 countries, total expenditure turns out to be the most frequent choice for
 a proxy of permanent income (
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a key control parameter for the analysis of visible consumption).
 In most of the studies, the said endogeneity of total expenditure is resolved
 by a choice of appropriate instruments - e.g.
 income, cubic-income, postive-income dummies or occupation codes.
 These instruments identified by Charles et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

 are reported to be quite strong in the studies surveyed as part of this
 note (Sargan and Wu-Hausman tests confirm endogeneity and the effectiveness
 of chosen instruments).

LSMS 2010 data on Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tanzania has been the first country to be surveyed as part of this study.
 With recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, the country
 provides a much desired snapshot of the consumer world of developing sub-Sahara
n Africa.
 The data chosen for the preliminary analysis is from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) conducted by the World Bank.
 LSMS includes expenditure microdata from about 10,000 households - with
 many of the expenditure categories of potential visible value.
 With no verifiable measure of visibility, all expenditure not related to
 food and utilities is evaluated for potentially visiblity.
 These chosen cateogries from LSMS are listed in Table

Obtaining visible consumption elasticities (using equation

 on diary method can result in measurement errors discussed in the previous

 their purchases when recalling).
 When the weekly data is mixed with yearly data - the extrapolation of past
 week's consumption may possibly overestimate food costs

\begin_layout Standard
The income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If there are

 individuals with

 sources of income each, then it is safe to assume that workers in the same
 region and same employment-type have resonably similar incomes.
 The variance in incomes recorded for the same local group can give an estimate
 of how noisy the data is due to self-reporting.

 and occupation codes were chosen for the current study.

Methods to measure Visibility 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The direct way of measuring visibility is to find an evidence of visibility
 in the comomdities.
 Most studies have relied on their own visibility surveys.
 In absence of such a survey, one can get verify commodities from public
 media - e.g.
 advertisements or social media traffic.
 These methods have not been pursued at this stage in the study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Consumption percentiles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences between amounts spent by the lowest and higher percentile
 of spenders of a particularly commodity are expected to be higher when
 a commodity is a status-good than when it is of common utility.
 The illustrations show non-zero log-level expenditure on a few commodities
 when the lower (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

) percentile of the consumption of the commodity is ignored.
 Ignoring the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile of the consumption of a visible commodity is equivalent to treating
 the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile expenditure as non-visible consumption (If we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=10\%$
\end_inset

 for electricity, then bottom 10% percentile of the consumption on electricity
 would be consider non-visible and anything above that level would be considered
 visible).
 The plots of log-expenditures are shown with rising 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (starting with the lowest percentile 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to lowest non-zero log-level of consumption of the commodity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an good that is not positional, one expects that the consumers from
 lower and higher quantiles of total expenditure (x-axis) would consume
 similar amounts of the good (y-axis).
 For a positional good, the consumers spending higher expenditure on good
 would lean towards consumers with higher total expenditure.
 This does not indicate signaling in any way - but tests only whether a
 commodity is consumed uniformly amongst those with lower and higher total
 expenditure outlays (this is more likely to be a measure of popularity
 of the item than of visibility).
 Choosing different thresholds (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta)$
\end_inset

 provides a a control on the degree to which a certain commodity can be
 included in our conspicuous consumption basket.
 Instead of asking whether marriage spending is visible or not - for example
 - the test asks if only the richer consumers can afford a significant expenditu
re on marriage (while varying the degree of visibility attached to spending
 on marriage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the data from Tanzania, while top 56% of consumers show spending on rice,
 electricity appears to be a luxury when only top 22 % of consumers spend
 on it.
 This may not necessarily suggest that a higher consumption of electricity
 indicates status but a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 for electricity certainly indicates its physical scarcity ( to use the
 terminology of Hirsch 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"

\end_inset

) - and thus a possible congestion arises for electricity.
 Since not all scarce objects can be indicative of status we either need
 some judgment to decide which products may indicate status signaling.
 A survey accomplishes this by ranking all products as viewed by its respondents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It must also be noted that visibility is hardly orthogonal to major expenditure
 categories and the usual arguments of additive utilities cannot hold for
 visible consumption.
 In other words, if walnut turns out to be of visible significance (ranked
 high in the consumers' perception of visibility in the survey) then one
 no longer talk about the combined utility of food visible items (walnut
 is both a food and a visible good)
\shape italic
.
 
\shape default
Detailed microdata thus becomes a necessity for fitting a utility function
 with visible components (

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar analysis of Consumer Expenditury Survey (CEX) data from years
 2004,2010 and 2014 similarly shows clear differences between expenditure
 on jewelry and fruits.
 It is evident that jewelry is not popular amidst the relatively poor and
 that richer consumers spend a higher portion of their total expenditure
 on jewelry than on fruits (curve being steeper for jewelry).

\begin_layout Standard
Heffetz finds that the degree to which people notice items tend to explain
 the corresponding (permanent) income elasticities better.
 This observation has been provided basis inspection of visible consumption
 for many works.
 In an environment of inequalities, one may need to understand whether the
 rich would notice something different from what the poor notice.
 The research in developing countries points out the effect of social classes
 on visible preference.
 Moreover, the consumption in developing countries as would the state of
 being a less individualist agrarian society (where expenditure is more
 visible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For visibility to bear significance in an environment of severe inequalities
 and scarcities, an association with higher-income beomes necessary.
 Zahra et al perform a slightly more detailed survey - by asking what would
 a person whose consumption is noticed do when her income rises (by 20%).
 This quantifies the expectations from others and assoication with higher-income
 - i.e.
 these items where consumers expect the consumption to rise are those that
 they associate with higher income.
 The criterion isn't merely the noticeability any more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visible consumption - which is really the detailed mechanics of status competiti
ons.
 We don't know of visible consumption without observing what people communicate.
 Scarcity merely allows status competitions - we intend to understand the
 sarcity a bit further - if we agree that i) rich people have high status
 or high-status people tend to be either rich and/or able to avail all facilitie
s otherwise.
 If this definition is agree to - then status competitions may occur because
 people perceive scarcity and they want to purchase goods.
 The visible items are merely indications to achieve what's scarce.
 The original theory that Veblen proposed was that of consipcuous items
 - items of conquest - that are scarce.
 Scarcity is more important than noticeability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status competitions are competitions for scarce items - more so in the developin
g countries - where mechanics of noticing each others income isn't really
 a phenomenon that exists for a lot of commodities.
 In developed countries scarcities are less - and the advertising effects
 are high expenditure help people separate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of consumption percentiles discussed above clearly offers no
 evidence of visibilty of a chosen item.
 While an item's visual appeal cannot be estimated with expenditure surveys,
 the root-cause of status signals remains is measurable the same way.
 But the reason why status signaling exists in a society - which is measured
 by visibility survey - is not an inherent need for visible appeal for certain
 item - but the item's association with status.
 Instead of limiting ourselves to the particular mechanics of status signaling
 - where consumers buy items in a common market and (presumably) overweigh
 on items that are more noticeable - we attempt to understand the reasons
 behind status-signaling by looking at the differences in patterns between
 the richer and poorer sections of society and understanding if price is
 the only barrier that limits and how commodities may reassert.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scarcity is measured by i) availability (electricity, food, education etc.)
 and ii) by affordability.
 Affordability is the primary criterion for scarcity.
 If the item is affordable and not available, it may still be scarce.
 Severe scarcities - which would be a physical scarcities in a Hirschian
 sense - would not permit status competitions.
 When there is medium scarcity, status competition can thrive while there
 is no status competition when there is no scarcity.

Claims Tested
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Effect of occupation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than the sparsity of available income data, the motivation behind
 grouping occupations is the predominance of the informal sector in Tanzania.
 A few occupations in the survey are neither well defined nor are truly
 an indicator of total income.
 The presence of categories like unpaid-family-work and of individuals with
 no-primary-job getting a significant income from their secondary occupations
 makes the task of associating the primary occupation of the household head
 with her income rather difficult (i.e.
 occupation - which is available for all household heads cannot be used
 as a proxy of household income - which is not available for all households).
 Grouping the occupations into fewer categories than in the survey (by putting
 paid/unpaid family work and agriculture under the same category for example)
 may allow for the smoothening of the effect of individual occupations and
 possibly serve as a proxy of socio-economic classes in the country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Effect of Education Level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the claims to be evaluated on the LSMS data is whether education
 has a significant effect on visible consumption.
 If the education level of NA is considered as none (for nearly 30% of the
 recorded individuals), then highest education level of the household held
 is found quite significant for many commodities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Effect of Immigration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a significant migration from rural areas, one of the claims to be tested
 is whether those resident in the community spend less on positional consumption.
 While this may be significant, it is of less importance than age or household
 size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Urbanization Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of Tanzania appears to be sparsely popsiulated with little access to
 basic services and it is likely that the administrative classifications
 of rural-urban areas do not reflect the consumer markets so well.
 Still, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is_rural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dummy is found significant for and houserent electricity (since most of
 rural Tanzania does not have electricity).
 Even if one were to use a dummy for accessible markets (created using the
 distance from the surveyed household location to the closest daily market
 ) - the effect is not so significant factor on positional consumption.
 The region dummies - on the other hand - are found to have significance
 - indicating regional disparaties in the country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Population density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Population density is a crude measure for crowding in the cities.
 The regions with higher population density do have a slight effect on consumpti
on of scarce commodities.
 It is hoped that a urban/rural dummy created by classifying districts based
 on their population densities may give a more detailed effect of population
 density.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Services as Visible Consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the interesting observations in the Vindex survey (Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

) is the clustering of services and products.
 It is found that services tend to be less 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the Western consumer world.
 The clustering might not be as clear-cut in the developing world - where
 social stratifications are severe and many services are contractual (non-moneta
ry).
 The socio-cultural barriers might have an effect through access to services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Towards that claim, English education as a control parameter is found quite
 significant for positional consumption.
 Those who identify themselves as English speakers tend to spend more on
 visible consumption.
 This indicates that English education may be quite scarce - and while it
 isn't reflected in the consumer market data so easily - it's likely to
 play a role in status competitions.

Analysis and Discussion

\begin_layout Standard
Food is a significant portion of total spending overall 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
50% of those surveyed spend 60% or higher of their total expenditure on
 food - subject to estimation errors.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 More importantly, those in non-agrarian professions spend about as much
 of their total on food as those in agrarian occupations 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The median ratio of food-expenditure to total expenditure for agrarian occupatio
n households is 60% while for non-agrarian occupations the median is 57%.
 Around 54% of the total surveyed households were in agrarian occupations.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The other half of the expenditure is spent on housing, education and energy
 requirements as well as various household products.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a commodity for private consumption (e.g.
 skincream or hobby-equipment in the LSMS data) might have an appeal for
 everyone - whether it is associated with high-income or not is a social
 psychological concern and cannot be assessed from the household survey
 by itself.
 In the absence of a visibility survey (asking the respondents how much
 they notice a product and whether they associate the product with high-income
 or not), one may still continue the discussion of the potential conspicuous
 value of items by looking at how scarce the item is (based on the percentile
 of consumers of the commodity).
 This is akin to repeating the analysis of visible expenditure with a given
 commodity as the only constituent of the visibility basket.
 The percentile of consumers using a given commodity and the slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(commodity-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $log(total-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 can tell us if richer sections of society spend higher on a certain commodity
 and if the poorer sections of society consume the chosen commodity at all
 (the commodities chosen in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 are those where this slope is significant).
 The effects (elasticities) of income and other individual household variables
 on the consumption of individual commodities can thus be studied until
 a visibility survey is available.
 The regression based on data prepared from the last step attempts to calculate
 the coefficients of the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (consumption of the a chosen commodity such as electricity, sports equipment),
 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure - which has been
 instrumented using

 and

\end_inset

summarize the results obtained by running regressions on several commodity-categ
ories.
 Since it is difficult to draw conclusions on the effects of particular
 social conditions on consumption of a commodity that is used by 10% or
 less of the total consumers, a column in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 also suggests the percentile of consumers using the commodity (electricity
 for example is used amongst those having top 93% of total expenditure).
 The usage of commodities such as skincream and other-personal-products
 (shampoos, razors etc.) are widespread compared with sports or hobby equipments
 and electricity.
 For commodities that are rare and consumed only amongst the rich (those
 with higher total expenditure) the effect of English literacy is significant.
 Similarly, hsize has a significant effect on both educational expense and
 personal products.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Do people spend more on status items than education? - Electricity is far
 more scarce than education.
 Spending on marriage isn't that much.
 It doesn't seem likely that people are paying more on electricity (it's
 just that electricity isn't available).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sacrcity of related objects and the cluster of inaccessible items would
 show up within the country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scarcity does occur in clusters.
 We should combine them to see how they affect status.
 Carpetsrugs require a certain housing status, English requires access to
 education, computers require access to electricity and so forth.
 Another interesting observation is that in expensive regions, people spend
 more on electricity than on marriage.
 Electricity being too expensive could be one cause.
 Higher occupations spend less on funerals and more on electricity.
 There seems a definite trend towards preference of industrial goods.

A Behavioural Model for Status Utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Utility and Status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of status is rather non-trivial and has characteristics of feedback
 (status may yield income through social barriers and but may requires income
 for signaling as well).
 The Ireland model used in the literature treats status-signaling as purchasing
 of visible and non-visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

.
 In the Ireland model, the combined utility for every consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $U=F(f(v,w),s)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)$
\end_inset

 is the private utility of the consumer and status 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be an increasing function of inference of others - 
\begin_inset Formula $s=f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - with 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 denoting visual consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 - the consumption that is not directly observable.
 Every consumer thus optimizes the combined private and visible utility.
 A practical consideration in the model is the separation between visible
 and non-visible consumption - a boundary that requies a socio-culutral
 judgment and has been drawn using consumer surveys in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What research in the developing markets further points out is that the parameter
 of combined utilty in a simplified model - (
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)\cdot f(v,w)+a\cdot f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - can vary for different sections of society.
 A slight adjustment of the model may be to another parameter that indicates
 once social class.
 This is more relevant in the developing world because social status is
 yielded through social barriers in many developing countries.
 Sections of society that are endowed with a higher status capital are in
 less of a need to purchase the commodities of visible consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the analysis of LSMS data on Tanzania so far, urban/rural differences
 have signficance in the consumption of scarce commodities.
 There are two ways to incoporate this into a model of signaling - one is
 to consider these household characteristics as a class of the consumers
 - and the other is to consider these characteristics as part of visible
 consumption.
 For example, English literacy seems to have correlation with the consumption
 of certain scarce products in Tanzania and 
\bar under
may indicate that people with access to English spend less on visible commoditie
s
\bar default
.
 In the model that is to be developed, English literacy (along with urban
 residence and other characterstics significant for consumption of scarce
 commodities) would be seen as status capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status capital cannot be quanitified as easily and remains a binary parameter
 in the model - uses as dummies that are found to have significant association
 with consumption of scarce commodities.
 The utility function in Ireland model can be thus viewed as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(h(v,z),w)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $v,w$
\end_inset

 are the visible and non-visible consumption quantities (respectively) -
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is a function of a a discrete variable 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 that denotes the social characteristic and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 - the visible consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that one needs to be careful while drawing conclusions based on consumpti
on of commodities that are themselves selected based on the percentiles
 consumption levels.
 The threshold method that we use to select scarce commodities (that are
 likely to be visible) - considers items that i) are accessible by no more
 than 50% of the consumers and ii) have their expenditure rising with permanent
 income.
 These are - by definition - items that the rich are more likely to afford.
 We cannot select items that the only richer section of society indulges
 in and claim that people spending on these selected items indicate higher
 status.
 Such a claim is only a restatement of the high permanent income and says
 nothing more substantial than that the richer population sections signal
 higher status.
 It would be a fallacy to associate visible consumption with household character
istics by only associating household characteristics with permanent income.
 The threshold method that we only measures the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scarcity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the item (e.g.
 electricity is more scarce than food) - not status per se.
 Indeed scarcity itself has an indirect effect on status competitions which
 cannot be denied - but this effect is not verified by the threshold method
 of classifying items itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
A model for scarcity and congestion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How scarcity leads to congestion is a different process in the developing
 world.
 Recent developments have made the process similar to that in the Western
 world, but the process is limited to urban settlements - areas where people
 are more huddled.
 The urban-rural differences are stark - the price differences and life
 style choices vary.
 The scarcity of services of industrial goods (which would be a necessity
 in the Western world) is evident from the data.
 The thrust towards migratioin and the desire for industrial goods needs
 to be pinned down with the survey of previous section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just the availability of electricity may open up a lifestyle that is unknown
 in the rural world.
 It may be seem drastic that a lifestyle choice transforming good such as
 electricity is the ultimate reason for migration but that is what we intend
 to test.
 That is what we mean by congestion.
 The question we seek answer for - which of the items - between a better
 house and an electricity matters more.
 Instead of visible goods, we limit our discussion to scarce goods - items
 that open up a new set of lifestyle.
 This denial of services is key to advertising mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The denial of services is a criteria that can be used to classiy all items.
 One thinks of a directed graph - which points to items that it denies (which
 themselves can be formed with items that deny other items and so and so
 forth).
 What we're now looking for are disconnected nodes in the graph - services
 and commodities that cannot be denied by the unreachable node in the graph.
 The criteria of denying is important to be defined here.
 One can think of person who is denied food in when energy (kerosene, electricit
y etc.) is unavailable but once again, this doens't apply to the larger populatio
n.
 The criteria of denying is one that needs to confirmed with statistical
 significance.
 Again, first comes the claim (e.g.
 nuts are available only to those who buy rice) - for which there may be
 limited proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
---
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that commodities appear in clusters, it is the scarcity of items
 that drives consumption.
 Congestion - a related phenomenon - is subject to demand and supply for
 a particular commodity and can be measured.
 If we were to consider food, for example, a limited supply and overpopulation
 can increase competition - .
 Similarly, for entertainment, censorship and introduction of internet can
 create congestion.
 For housing, new constructions and overpopulation can cause congestion.
 As such, congestion is commodity-specific and a focus on selected items
 may be the only way to test whether there is disproportiante consumer spending
 on the commodity.
 The data from Tanzania so far only seems to point that availability of
 services in urban and rural area could be serving as status signals.

A Behavioural Experiment for Status Competitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Status and Consumption as games
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Games have been used in the literature in the developing countries to gauge
 motivations of the participating consumers.
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A study by Sophie Clot studies the effect high and low effort work on consumptio
n by conducting an experiment at the payment office where some amount of
 pay is distirbuted for low-effort work and some for high-effort work.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While the visibility surveys (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

) attempt to study how consumption on certain commodities may signal status,
 the goal of the proposed game is to characterise environments under which
 the perceptions of a higher-status may develop.
 The game attempts to emulate i) the consumer market and ii) the mechanism
 through which status may be assigned within a group of consumers.
 It therefore relies on participants playing the dual role of a consumer
 and status-observer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The activities of purchasing and assigning status are separate in the game.
 Since a simulated purchase performed by the participants in the game (given
 a list of commodities, prices and outlay) is quite likely to deviate from
 their real world purchases and their real needs, the participants are instead
 asked what additional items they would purchase for a given a basket of
 commodities that they already possess (using a cumulative voting scheme
 that emulates selection of commodities in a market - see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Purchasing_Mechanism"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The second part of the game emulates status assignment - where participants
 assign a score of status and effectiveness each to 3 (or more) other participan
ts in the game by looking at the quantities of the item categories purchased
 by the latter.
 The judgment of status in the real world does not involve direct observance
 of prices and thus it is only the quantity of the identified items consumed
 or already possessed that matters in the status-assignment part of the
 game.
 The end-goal of the game is to purchase a basket most desired by others
 - the winner achieves this goal by purchasing commodities of her choice
 that are most desirable by everyone and are indicative of a rank higher
 than everyone else in the game.

\begin_layout Standard
It is difficult for players to conduct a

\end_inset

 in a way that truly represents their needs.
 Hence, instead of asking the respondent how they'll spend the given outlay

 spend the additional 100 dollars for a given 1000 dollars of outlay (or
 more) value of items that they already have stocked up.
 The

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is made of non-positional items, the particpants choose 3 items from a
 mix of non-positional items and positional items - given the 10% extra
 outlay.
 Since all participants cannot be assumed to be equally numerate, the game
 uses a scheme similar to cumulative voting - where 10 virtual coins are
 provided to the participant and the participant is asked to distribute
 the coins amongst a set of available items (both positional and non-positional).
 The provided outlay in the game (number of coins) may vary for participants
 - in proportion to the income distribution that is observed in the relevant
 consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS for Tanzania).

Mixes in the Consumer Basket

\begin_layout Standard
While the basket for every consumer can be varied to model urban/rural differenc

 game ensures that all participants have reasonably similar consumer universe.
 Consequently, no category is intended to be completely removed from the
 basket (i.e.
 all baskets have the same set of categories).
 Following are the categories for which the positional/non-positional variants
 are sought:

Constraints and Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The game attempts to meaure status and consumption with respect to high
 asset ownership, social class or familial responsibility.
 Since players choose between physical needs and positional needs in the
 game, a different circumstance is likely to affect their choice and hence
 their perceived status.
 The game presents a precondition to the player - indicating high asset
 ownership, a chosen social class or a familial liability.
 For example, to test a participant's choice between food and electricity,
 the game can present a large family as a constraint, and record the choice
 between spending more on food vs installing electricity.
 The game thus measures indirect effects of reward or constraints on status
 by allowing participants to gauge the suitability of a participants's choice
 in the status game in the presence of constraints (familial) or rewards
 (asset-related).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the constraint variable is only planned to be binary in the
 current scheme i.e.
 it is either a reward or a liability (when present).
 The two values are expected to have an opposite affect on the purchase
 of new items.
 Admittedly, the binary values of constraints vs rewards circumvent the
 difficulty in comparisons between disparate needs of the consumers - e.g.
 a large family, senior member or a social event (e.g.
 marriage/funelal).
 While a multivalued variable (if adopted) can potentially provide better
 insights into the relative effects of these several types constraints,
 the goal of the current exercise is to test for a direct effect of constraints
 on status (rather than relative effect of the constraints).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Status ranking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The status-ranking activity involves a student assigning a status score
 by looking at i) what the other participant with a given income level does
 with the extra outlay and ii) what the participant already possesses.
 In the ranking scheme, the participants provide a score on effectiveness
 as well as status to all the other (3 or more) participants observed.
 Notice that in presence of constraints specified in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:constraints"

\end_inset

, regardless of whether one is selfish or not, a participant would tend
 to penalise someone else who she thinks is going to be more selfish than
 herself.
 Since the game provides a way to penalize selfishness by status ranks,
 the participants are discouraged from indicating status through overspending
 on positional items.
 The penalty for not caring for a sick parent 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
may be huge in the society but so can be the penalty for being stingy.
 Similarly, while some may want to indicate wealth by buying a watch they
 may also fear disrespect for not taking care of a sick family member.
 The scores on effectiveness and status are thus not only a way to discourage
 the consumer from limiting the unrealistic purchases in the simulated purchasin
g part of the game, they also track the effect of the externalities such
 as sickness or age (measured through the binary variable discussed in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:constraints"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While consumers try to maximise their utility by purchasing more items for
 a given limited outlay - they also manage their prestige by letting others
 have a better opinion of themselves.
 The status game can thus be seen as an enhanced version of the survey that
 asks people to imagine a neighbour who spends more than them on a chosen
 commodity (used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

).
 The proposed game attempts to measure how consumers might act given a certain
 circumstances while both status and welfare (effectiveness score can be
 seen as a proxy of concern for others) become part of the payoff function
 in the game.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Welfare and Status competitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution of this game for a set of rational players remains a pending
 exercise in this study.
 The key motivation for the analysis at this point is that fundamentally
 all social welfare concerns are concerns of Pareto optimality.
 Moreover, the payoff function for effectiveness in the game is meant to
 be a proxy for welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Pareto optimality in mind, more spending on education, health seems
 desirable - but it may be become distant for consumers due to their immediate
 needs - whether positional or non-positional.
 A comparison with what is observed in consumption data versus what is observed
 about positional consumption in games can provide some insight into the
 social status that can influence the desired welfare equilibrium.

Policy implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data anlaysis discussion so far leans towards permitting status competitions
 rather than attempting to tax or control them.
 This is in line with the suggestions offered by Robert H Frank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 favouring a non-monetary market of stauses only so that status games (which
 are a necessity) do not overlap with the market for real goods.
 Due to structural reasons of the modern economy, advertising efforts can
 turn a social scarcity into a physical scarcity (to use the Hirsch's terminolog
y
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"

\end_inset

).
 A profit-driven industry and the advertising pursued by the companies tend
 to increase the status competition for a commodity.
 Instead of letting status competitions modify the distribution of that
 physical goods (and thus do little do avoid the problem of physical scrarcities
 in the developing countries), policy can attempt to provide status-games
 in a world of non-necessity items - in some ways to diffuse the status
 competitions in the society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In poor and non-pecuniary societies, the desire to become rich or the benefit
 of inheriting money and education is often less reachable.
 Status and money translate into social securities in unstructured societies.
 These may well be detected in the countries in Africa - but limited data
 on household characteristics in Tanzania (related to ethnicity or religion)
 have prevented us from this analysis for Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question that one needs to ask in the context of Tanzania (or another
 developing country) is whether the expenditure (as Priais Houthakker performed
 for expensive and cheap tea for class) - is actually more desirable from
 than higher classes spending on housing and education.
 This is the goal of the experiment.
 If the answer is indeed the former, then it makes sense to limit the status
 competitions (possibly by introducing brand differentiation) through policy
 to support status competitions on non-essential items.Attaching glamour
 to education, healthcare and food items or can help consumers prioritize
 their needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite cultural differences it is remarkable that the trends in development
 on private and public consumption are governed by the same forces in both
 the developing and the developed world.
 The colonial institutions followed a slow decay than destruction retaining
 a lot of their character and becoming part of the status games of society.
 The difference between private and public consumption has been a reminiscence
 of this wide disparities in physical possessions (education, housing, food
 and health) of the past era.
 Post-war industrial developments were far better at improving private consumpti
on than they were about public consumption - which was higher when labour
 was cheaper and the capital and power was limited to the very few.
 In absence of the new power exercised by corporations that work with local
 institutions, public consumption cannot improve.

Price Differences in LSMS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature has not used panel data analysis in the context of conspicuous
 consumption.
 While an influence hf rising pr es can complicate the analysis of visible
 consumption indicators, the insights from demand elasticities are essential
 to understanding the relative effect of status-related consumption against
 other commodities.
 Higher price of food items may suppress consumption on food - but one cannot
 answer whether an increase in price of food suppresses its consumption
 more than it suppresses consumption of non-food items or not - without
 an estimation of demand elasticities.
 Such details of consumption patterns are basket-dependent and are not accessibl
e without a record of prices of all types of items in the basket.
 Unfortnately, a lack of prices for non-food items in the LSMS prevent this
 much desired time-series analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though an analysis on non-food prices is inaccessbile with the unavailabili
ty of price data in most consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS), a time-series analysis based on food prices alone can provide insights
 into the pressures on food consumption.
 Using historical prices on calorie consumption in India, Deaton and Jean
 Dreze point out that the overall calorie consumption has declined while
 the total outlay has increased in India (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"

\end_inset

).
 The change in positional value of food - determined by price differentiation
 in the market and scarcity - can potentialy help explain some of this decline.
 While such a decline is reported to be less in the case of sub-Saharan
 African countries than in India, the regional differences within the country
 could be explained by the change of food's position in the consumer universe
 (i.e.
 the so-called

Regional differences

\begin_layout Standard
If a scarcity is widespread, it is less likely to be perceived as a scarcity

\bar default
 The analysis in the previous chapter inspects the effect of region on consumpti
on - where the high-price regions are detected using food prices.
 The question that we wish to answer is whether someone living in a high
 food-price area spends less on certain visible items or not.
 Further analysis of the effect of region and migration can provide more
 insights in the expenditure on status-signaling goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Observations from LSMS Food data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In certain areas - prices for food vary a lot more than they do in others.
 This is a phenomenon that varies from commodity to commodity.
 For example, the prices for onions and sugar don't vary so much by area
 code as they do for meat and chicken).
 The regions Dar-es-salaam, Mbeya mwanza, Mjini/Magharini unguja stand out
 for higher prices for multiple items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, some items have more price-differences overall than others
 - rice (husked), maize(grain), sweet potatoes, irish potatoes, groundnuts(shell
ed), goat meat, chicken and canned milk corresond to numerous (>4) region-codes
 where they're reportedly sold in different prices ranges.
 While it is tempting to claim that price differences in the market indicate
 that there is more price-differentiation and possibly more competition
 - one needs to consider the overall scarcity of the commodity (the percentiles
 of the commodity expenditure which we judge using the threshold method)
 as well as the preference for the item amongst the rich (measure by higher
 expenditure with income) for the item to be considered a status-signaling
 item.
