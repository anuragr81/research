\begin_layout Plain Layout

Status competitions amongst workers often explain the income distribution
 better than the permanent income or productivity models.
 The current study looks for instances of status competitions within communities
 in developing countries, focusing on sub-Saharan African countries where
 recent large-scale urban migrations and proliferation of industrial products
 have occurred after social upheavals.
 The goal of this study to understand the changes in status competitions
 in response to proliferation of industrial products, changing family characteri
stics, regional effects and social interaction levels.
 The study also attempts to establish a general criterion for positional
 consumption and seeks methods to measure positional value of an item an
 environment of advertising and marketing.
 A key claim of the study is that physical scarcity in the developing countries
 does not rule out social scarcities and that the status competitions and
 positional consumption must be considered for a better understanding of
 urban migration patterns and consumption pressures.

 A quantile regression can be used to test whether the purchases of status

 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves

Many studies related to conspicuous consumption have relied on a visibility
 survey - which quantifies the lot of complex interactions in what may constitut
e status competitions in a society.
 A luxury item - for example - needs to be marketed as a luxury for it to
 both impart visible signals to others and to improve self-perception of
 the buyer.
 In Veblen's original framework, for a product to indicate status it must
 be rare and superfluous (thus serve as an exploit).
 That a watch is more noticeable than an insurance policy (and associated
 with higher income) is not entirely relevant to this framework.
 Moreover, whether a poor person buying a cheap watch and a richer person
 buying an expensive watch (probably subject to import restrictions) are
 both instances of conspicuous consumption or not depends on the context
 that the observer chooses.
 Cheap watches may or may not constitute conspicuous consumption - depending
 on the social welfare function.
 The wide variety of criteria in conspicuous consumption seem to indicate
 this ambiguity (See Table

).

In both the developed and developing worlds, conspicuous consumption is
 driven by perceived scarcity and competition (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 If status were imparted by inherited wealth alone, there would be little
 conspicuous consumption as the consumers would be quick to realise the
 futility of buying trinkets.
 In the developed world, where markets have evolved to address the demands
 of the population, the positional pressures are readily addressed by market
 forces - thus a preference for visible goods indicates a higher price on
 them and a higher consumption on visible products always 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

signals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a higher status (a product with a higher status symbol would automatically
 carry a higher price).
 In underdeveloped markets, where information asymmetries are abound, the
 higher signalling (for conspicuous consumption) would not necessarily be
 achieved with higher spending on visible goods - and other factors (e.g.
 social standing, asset ownership, social networks and education) start
 to matter in the combined utility function - as is suggested by data from
 various cross-section expenditure surveys.
 These other mechanisms of signaling - although not part of purchases -
 fall under Veblen's view of conspicuous consumption.

Scarcity - A term used by Fred Hirsch in a theory to explain distribution
 of resources in a society.
 Scarcity is the perceived or real lack of products or services created
 by a competition for them which is intensified by population growth ( through
 increased productivity and time costs).
 Scarcities can be either direct or indirect and thus - physical or social.
 Hirsch also points out that social scarcities are becoming physical scarcities
 (so this distinction isn't so clear after all).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

Congestion - The competition for resources in the context of modern Western
 society where physical scarcities (severe shortages of food and shelter)
 have been largely conquered.
 In Hirsch's theory, congestion is a side-effect of commercialization and
 removal of older social barriers.
 Since all goods and amenities are available through money, the competition
 and scarcity for what used to be accessible to only the top few have intensifie
d.
 With economic progress therefore, consumers are more - not less - driven
 by status needs than before.
 Writing in what is now called the affluent

 It encompasses not just goods available for purchase in the market (that
 are bought by consumers to improve their perceived status) - but also the
 barriers that may indicate status through rareness.
 Veblen's was a rather unconventional attempt to link the social barriers
 with expenditure

A robber baron, Veblen says, has a better chance of escaping the law than
 a small crook because “a well-bred expenditure of his booty especially
 appeals to persons of a cultivated sense of the proprieties and goes far
 to mitigate the sense of moral turpitude with which his dereliction is
 viewed by them.” Scholars do not ordinarily associate the disposal of ill-gotten
 wealth with good breeding (quoted from Galbraith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "GalbraithEssential"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Veblen's focus had been the consumption patterns of the richer section
 of society and the way conspicuous consumption is understood is through
 to inference of status through continued search for expensive or rare items.
 Veblen provides a psychological framework to explain the competitions that
 have survived since barbaric times when insignia were used to indicate
 status.
 Status indication - as is noted in the study in the context of developing
 countries - can extend beyond the purchase of items in the market.

 In the Europe of eighteenth century, he argued, the rich could pursue their
 interests while the poor gained mobility in exchange of their participation
 but in the modern society - where basic needs had largely been fulfilled
 - social mobility was no longer lucrative to offer for exchange.
 Status differentials were necessary to create new markets - where positional
 goods and advertisement had a major role to play

Hirsch's model for positional competitions is explained in the Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 With the physical scarcity of goods (food and amenities) largely conquered,
 scarcity becomes largely social in the developed countries.
 More commercialization (availability of previous unavailable items through
 money) leads to more scarcities and more competitions - hence instances
 of congestion for a good develop - leading to increased positional competition
 in the society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key issue in developing an empirical understanding the relationship between
 congestion and scarcity is of semantic nature.
 Scarcity seems a more general concept than mere unavailability or low supply
 of an item - as it seems to entail both unavailability of the item and
 the competition for it.
 Hirsch does differentiate between physical scarcity (unavailability) and
 social scarcity (competition) he also comments that the boundary between
 physical and social scarcities can get blurred as the positional goods
 create a market for themselves.
 This makes understanding the relation scarcity and competitions for an
 item itself somewhat difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may face similar difficulties in trying to empirically test a lot of
 the cultural trends identified by both Hirsch and Veblen.
 Even with access to a reliable microdata on consumption sampled over varied
 social identities and extending over a period of decades, it is difficult
 to track and measure the nature of connections between individuals.
 The perceptions of quantities like status are not directly measurable -
 and our understanding of the psychological motivations for consumption
 is still under development.
 Behavioural sciences usually get around this problem through carefully
 designed experiments - by creating contexts where subjects can choose amongst
 well-defined options.
 What works in smaller environment might not necessarily scale up to higher
 levels but often our best effort is to identify factors that have a clear
 impact under a well-defined setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of attempting to wide-ranging cultural trends, we test for presence
 of status competitions in empirical data.
 For the implicit assumption that the status competitions are inherent in
 human society, we bank on Robert Frank's argument that striving to achieve
 more than others is likely to be ingrained in our hormones(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

).
 The empirical examples to support for this argument are abound.
 Exploring incomes amongst professors competing for grants - for example
 - Franks
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 notes that neither the Permanent Income model nor the productivity model
 explains the distribution of income.
 What offers a better explanation is the presence of status competition
 among the professors.
 Similarly, he demonstrates that in the absence of monopolies, it becomes
 difficult for corporations to survive by rewarding talent alone and they
 are thus compelled to depend on status competitions for income distribution

While instances of status competitions can be verified easily in a small
 environment, asserting the presence of larger socio-cultural concepts like
 commercialisation isn't easy to justify.
 We don't engage in the understanding how status competitions - which operate
 at finer levels in society (particularly in the institutions of family
 and similar social networks) - develop into wider cultural trends.
 Instead, we limit ourselves to measuring status competitions from consumption
 while treating status competitions as microeconomic illustrations of wider
 cultural trends.

.
 One leans towards thinking that scarcities may be only physical in the
 developing countries (and probably as similar to those in the 18th century
 Europe), but the presence of status related competitions is still relevant
 (and in accordance with Veblen's claim).
 Still, scarcity through 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

overuse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (which Hirsch stresses as the engine of social scarcity in the modern Western
 society) may be irrelevant in the developing world - where there simply
 aren't enough status items to be consumed.
 Whether the recent trends of commercialisation in the developing world
 would bear similarities with the changes in the post-war Europe are claims
 that are difficult to test empirically because of vast cultural dissimilarities
 in the developing world and poorer quality of available consumption microdata
 in the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can however, safely rely on the presence of status competitions.
 There literature on conspicuous consumption in the developing countries
 finds that status competitions do have an effect on consumption.
 Relying only on the presence of status competitions, we consider Hirsch's
 ideas of scarcity and congestion relevant in the developing countries.
 Scarcity is interpreted simply as the consumed quantity in the markets
 (or supply/unavailability) of a particular commodity while congestion as
 changes in consumption levels within social groups (family, locality or
 higher orders).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How consumption affects and is reflected by status differences in the society
 varies across societies.
 Focusing primarily on status differences in society, we attempt to understand
 to what degree consumption is used by a given population of individuals
 to associate themselves to those with higher status in society.
 If we can measure the conspicuous consumption in society, we test can test
 the claim whether with more unequal societies have more reasons to rely
 on status classifications.
 Status competitions are therefore perpetual.
 An end of old status securities should go hand with provision of alternative
 securities - otherwise old securities might be the only way to provide

Status as lagged asset ownership and consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How a society perceives differences in status is difficult to record - let
 alone standardize it across multiple geographies.
 Relying on consumption microdata, we only record the assets and income
 of individuals that the higher-status individuals are more likely to acquire
 than the low status individuals.
 This view of status comprise strictly of i) possessions (assets and consumption
) and ii) the barriers to possessions.
 These status determinants enhance status by more consumption or more assets
 - in the sense that consumption and assets add to existing possessions.
 When more barriers exist for others to acquire the possessions as that
 of oneself, the higher status one may have.
 It is possible that that possessions translate as status only through barriers
 (items that have no other value except through barriers that exist to acquire
 them).
 The role of conspicuous consumption then is to distort the status derived
 from other determinants of status.
 Through consumption, status items may be used to to pass the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

barriers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to status (thus changing them) .
 Buying an item that was previously limited to someone with ah higher status
 than oneself invariably enhances one's status.
 Indeed consumption is not all that enhances (or distorts) status in society
 - inherited or acquired assets also have the same effect - it is only that
 consumption of expendable items is less expensive than buying long-term
 assets and may be more prevalent as low-hanging fruit for fulfillment of
 status needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All barriers themselves can be expressed either in terms of weights of the
 personal characteristics of an individual (e.g.
 locality, age, gender, ethnicity).
 We observe that the barriers borne out of personal characteristics can
 carry more status where there are social disparities in the society.
 More barriers (weights of a certain personal characteristic) may mean that
 more consumption may be needed by individuals of different personal characteris
tic to achieve the same status in society.
 The model provided by Coreno et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 is instructive in this regard.
 The model (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

) considers a ranking function for every individual where consumption is
 seen as a way to transform the income ranking of a population i.e.
 individuals improve their perception in society through consumption (and/or
 asset ownership) to overcome their income rank in the society.
 It can be asserted that anyone in less than the highest income group (more
 specifically -the highest quantile of the all status determinants minus
 that of consumption) would benefit from a short-term expense on status-related
 consumption.
 Therefore, one can claim that the consumption rank (or utility) and non-consump
tion status rank (or utility) must differ for the consumers in medium quantiles
 - if conspicuous consumption exists in a society (in other words, the measures
 of income and rest of the determinants of status must not be correlated
 with consumption).
 This verification serves as the test of conspicuous consumption (roughly
 indicated by the permanent income elasticity of conspicuous consumption).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above claim however rests on a conspicuous good being well-defined.
 One can verify or measure the degree of conspicuous consumption in terms
 of the consumption ranks with a good that is well-understood to be a status
 good - but finding out what goods may be of status significance is non-trivial.
 Since we don't already know which items can impart status - we assume that
 all consumption items can impart status (particularly when the items for
 status are subject to change over time).
 We also treat expensive varieties of an item as of potential status value
 (thus treating the expensive variety of an otherwise commonplace item as
 a status good).
 Instead of agreeing on a crisp boundary between conspicuous and non-conspicuous
 items, therefore, we choose to sort the items in terms of their status
 value (or the status utility that a consumer may derive).
 We focus on how items are selected for status related consumption, and
 use a selection criteria which involves considering how rare an item is,
 how costly it is in the market and if there is the purchases increase for
 the property as supply increases.
 This is explained in a later section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A claim that we intend to test is whether the consumption on items that
 have a high impact on status must decrease (increase) with the decrease
 (increase) in gaps in assets and other barriers in the society over time.
 In other words, More significant differences in determinants of status
 must correspond to an increase in consumption of the consumers for those
 with a medium rank of status.
 A quantile regression can be used to test whether the purchases of status
 items is different across income quantiles of the society.

Institutions of a society are critical in maintaining purchasing power of
 its individuals as well as a mix of equality and social mobility amongst
 them.
 The strength of institutions are varied in the developing world and measuring
 the effect of cultural contexts on the status consumption across countries
 spread across continents often requires excessive generalisations.
 Since we have limited our scope to status competitions, we focus only on
 differences in status in the respective society.
 Further, status is understood only in terms of possessions - acquired through
 income and purchase of items.
 Instead of dealing with the social psychological problem of measuring status
 perceptions in a society, therefore, we limit ourselves to the characteristics
 that may represent status in society.

 aspiring to establish nation-states.
 Some of these backgrounds are discussed for a few countries in Africa.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 (often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike) their limited reach and success leaves the possibility of having
 left the status differences intact.
 It is even possible that the status competitions that may have otherwise
 been limited to tribal or local levels could have now found expressions
 in the hastily developing urban settings

Status and Consumption in the Developing world
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the view of status we have adopted, the differences in purchasing power
 between the sections of a society and the mobility between them are key
 drivers of status-related consumption .
 That status and mobility can contribute to the economic development of
 a society is a belief that goes back Adam Smith - who had proposes that
 the economic progress can be achieved by letting an exchange between the
 rich and poor thrive.
 To use Wicksteed's words, trinkets could be turned into bread in this world-vie

 - more spending on a conspicuous item would benefit the society as a whole
 - since the money obtained from the rich on the item could potentially
 fund employment and other opportunities.
 Electricity in Africa, for example, would be a model item for this purpose
 - an item whose consumption can drive the expansion of power plants and
 make electricity cheaper for everyone.
 More spending on signaling goods does not appear to be a social waste from
 this perspective.
 However, we note that not all marketable goods are as desirable as electricity
 and there may be goals more desirable than what the exchange between rich
 and poor can provide.
 Unlike in the Western world - where the differences between the rich and
 poor have purportedly been reduced to a level that this exchange could
 not be made lucrative to the poor any more
\begin_inset Foot

 - the basic needs for the masses haven't been addressed in the developing
 world.
 While one could expect the exchange between rich and poor to draw the masses
 out of poverty in Africa, there are limits to how much success can be achieved
 in the developing countries.
 This is because the essential goods often lack a market in the developing
 countries and since marketable goods often create needs on their own, the
 development of market for conspicuous goods may prevent the status competitions
 from achieving the goals of social welfare.
 The way societies are structured, anything available to the richer sections
 of the society can easily become a status good and thus the possibility
 of a social waste due to spending on status goods cannot be ruled out in
 the developing countries either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
These limitations of status competitions matter since the institutions in
 developing countries are generally weak and have developed in on the path
 to achieving goals of nationalism.
 The developing countries now face the problem of institutions not being
 strong enough to establish the exchange between the rich and the poor or
 to let it thrive.
 In the new urban settings in Africa, both tribal identities and the hierarchies
 formed through education, money or industrial assets can contribute to
 status competitions.
 While this development can encourage institutions of money and education

 limit themselves to markets not developed enough to undertake severe scarcities.

The relationship between education, urban developments, income levels and
 tribal identities is difficult to assess without the access to the microdata

 Still, the measurement error for variables in any claimed relationship

 i) a bulky informal sector (which may have expanded due to recent economic
 developments), ii) expansions in the areas of micro-credit as well as mass
 education

The current study so far considers only the district level residence and
 the primary spoken language as the demographic factors that may contribute

 We intend to understand the factors that influence either status differences

 Urban migration and industrial developments (through increased wealth and
 few industrial goods) can increase status differences in society while
 the status-related consumption is influenced by supply or scarcity of the
 status-related items (which also drives the demand of the item) as well
 as the growth in income of the individuals in the society.
 These factors are briefly discussed in the following subsections.

Status is the most strongly indicated by the amount of wealth someones amasses.
 A key argument that we rely upon is that status related consumption exists
 because i) those in the middle-rank of wealth might want to indicate more
 status than is indicated by their real wealth and ii) wealth is often not
 directly visible.
 Status-related consumption is therefore universally relevant for status
 competitions.

Supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In simple terms, a status item indicates the buyer's status to the immediate
 surroundings.
 Status being a sociological phenomenon, it becomes non-trivial to classify
 a good as a status or signaling good.
 If for example, only the rich could afford electricity in a society, electricit
y may not appear as a signaling product for most of the population.
 From the point of view of consumption, a good being used by a smaller and
 richer part of the population may seem to have less significance than a
 good used by the majority of the population.
 One is tempted argue that items consumed by more people carry more significance
 in deciding whether a good is a status good or not
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A regression with quantities consumed as dependent variable would bear more
 significance for items consumed by more people.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - however, one must also consider the supply of the item and the permanent
 income of the consumer before declaring an item more status bearing than
 the other.
 When an item is in limited supply, only those consumers with higher purchasing
 power (or those who must pass some other barrier) would have access to
 it.
 For example, if electricity is not available throughout the country, then
 only those with higher income or with residence in certain areas (where
 there is electricity) can have their signaling needs fulfilled with the
 item.
 Hence, when expenditure on the item is limited to the richer sections of
 society, then the item is a status good merely through being a statement
 of wealth

\begin_layout Standard

Other than the price of the item in the market or other barriers to distribution
 of the desired item, what characterises a some status improving commodities
 is the tendency of the consumers to flock towards the item.
 The demand for certain status items is enhanced by the popularity of the
 item.
 Newly introduced goods thus often create a market of their own - a mechanism
 often accentuated by the advertising effects.
 This so-called

As a crude way to detect this tendency to flock towards an item (i.e.
 the bandwagon effect), we rely on time-series change of the budget share
 (or elasticities) of the item to see how sensitive the budget share of
 the item is to time, income and supply.
 The budget share for an item can shift when its supply is increased (more
 electrical power plants or cheaper alternative energy would reduce the
 budget share on electricity).
 If the budget share of electricity increases then we conclude that people
 may be flocking to the commodity (after accounting for income effects)

It must be clarified that not all status goods need to exhibit flocking
 of consumers.
 If the item has been restricted to the richer section of the society for
 a long time, then increase abundance of the item can actually cause disinterest
 in that item.
 As new items can always appear in the market through innovation or imports,
 a consumer uses both snob and bandwagon items to indicate her status.
 But as long as everybody wants higher status it can be argued that all
 newly introduced status goods would exhibit a change in budget share with

 The small-scale private enterprise - which forms the majority of non-agrarian
 workforce in sub-Saharan Africa - receives very little governmental assistance.
 Hence the expansion of informal economy has continued and the migration
 to urban areas increased significantly in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The interaction between urban and rural Africa is of prime significance
 in any study of consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The dynamics of urban migration can serve as a test-bed of consumption patterns
 in the presence of industrial goods and the difference between urban and
 rural areas.
 A flight to urban areas is often not simply an escape from despondent circumsta
nces but also a chance for improbable social mobilities.
 Yet the opportunities of income and social mobility are not all that are
 offered by the migration to urban areas - the availability of the range
 of products that are entirely absent from the agrarian rural settings also
 have a role in the promise of a better lifestyle.
 A model cognisant of the demand for these items can enhance the model based
 on the expected income payoff from migration (where the payoff itself is
 often not known nor assessed by the migrant).

Population density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overpopulated urban areas are commonplace in sub-Saharan African countries
 - particularly because of the expansion of informal economy and recent
 developments in the economy.
 Population density does seem to bear significance with consumption of status
 items - but this is more likely due to urban and rural differences than
 population density itself.
 If similar products were available in both rural and urban areas, one may
 expect that the more communication between individuals that may potentially
 intensify the bandwagon effects and status competitions.
 While studying the effect of social interaction on income distribution,
 for example, Robert H.
 Frank (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 areas of big cities in the US where lower status individuals are huddled
 together and are likely to have more signaling needs
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

.
 One might expect this to be true in the developing countries too - as the
 perceived hierarchies in the society matter for the demand of a status
 goods in both developed and developing economies.
 However, the lack of availability of similar products in the rural areas
 by far dominates the effect of population density in the developing countries
 in Africa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A counter-argument to our conclusion of the dominance of supply issues could
 be that the rural areas don't have enough status needs to motive industrial
 development and for status goods to matter.
 After all the bulk of nationalist ideas which the region has experimented
 with in the past decades relies on the fundamental belief that the unified
 group identities can address physical scarcities and drive economic development.
 We don't however see a negative effect of population density on status
 consumption in the overcrowded areas.
 The data doesn't seem to support the theory that individuals staying close
 together leads to rejection of the demand for status goods.
 Thus while we cannot support Robert H.
 Frank's findings in he data from Tanzania, we do not find a proof of the
 opposite either (after accounting for the differences in the consumer basket
 between rural and urban areas).
 Unfortunately the unavailability of microdata on social identities in rural
 areas makes it difficult to draw detailed conclusions on social identities.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

).
 Using an individual's sensitivity to social status signals in the model,
 they use a utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)f(v,w)+af(\hat{v},\hat{w})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{v},\hat{w}$
\end_inset

 are societies' view of the consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

).
 Solving for a separating equilibrium, this results in 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{{1+\beta}}{a+\beta}+Cv^{-\frac{{\beta}}{a}}(a>0)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\frac{{a}}{a+\beta}(\frac{\beta}{1+\beta})^{\frac{{\beta}}{a}}b^{\frac{{a+\beta}}{a}}$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is derived by considering the utility maximization at lowest income level
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 as the boundary condition for the utility maximization problem).
 Elasticities in this model are 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{v}=\frac{{dv}}{dy}\cdot\frac{{y}}{v}=a((1+\beta)\frac{{v}}{y}-\beta)^{-1}$
\end_inset

.

 Robustness tests (regressions for different quantiles and across multiple
 demographic categories) reported an all through significance of the Vindex
 regressor (normalised measure of the response from users for how much they
 would notice the consumption on a certain commodity).

The need for a survey to measure visibility of items in the basket is however
 necessary when conducting similar studies in the developing countries

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Khamis et al

 ask two key questions to respondents in an online survey conducted in India.
 First asked them how closely they needed to interact with their neighbour
 (with similar demographic characteristics) in order to observe above average
 spending for a list of items (Options were -‘1: No Interaction’, ‘2: Occasional
 Interaction’, ‘3: Friend’, ‘4: Close Friend’ or ‘5: No matter how much
 one Interacts’).
 An item where >20% respondents report 1 or 2 was considered a visible item.
 A second question asked them what they'll expect of the consumption of
 an item after a sudden 20 percent rise in their neighbor's income ‘1: Fall’,
 ‘2: Stay the same’, ‘3: Increase by less than 20 percent’, ‘4: Increase
 by 20 percent’ or ‘5: Increase by more than 20 percent’.
 The list of items in these questions attempted to match the consumption
 categories in the IHDS.
 An item is associated with higher income if more than 20% of respondents
 reported 2,3,4 or 5.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Visibility is a socio-cultural judgment - and the visibility basket from
 the developed world cannot be translated as such into disparate geographies
 and cultural environments of the developing world.
 One can in fact arrive at wrong conclusions on visible consumption for
 a consumer group if a visibility basket was chosen from a different cultural
 environment.
 For example, hair-products may be associated with a higher visibility (and
 promise) in the developed world but in the developing world their purpose
 could be just utilitarian (poor quality of production, cultural factors
 etc.).
 Attributing lower visible consumption based on a low consumption of hair-produc
ts would thus be erroneous.

Another practical problem arises in the developing world because of the
 predominant use of recall method in expenditure survey.
 A relevant anomaly is the Deaton Paxson paradox(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonPaxsonParadox"

\end_inset

) - i.e.
 the observed decrease in food expenditure per head as household size rises
 (with constant outlay per head).
 The likely cause for the paradox is presence of errors correlated with
 household size in the data that results in possible overestimation of the
 consumption of recalled items
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonDeatonPaxson"

\end_inset

.
 Caution must therefore be taken (or a correction applied) when mixing expenditu
res from recall and diary methods.

While the visibility elasticities may not be compared across countries without
 above considerations but a comparison within the country can provide insights
 into the effect of certain demographic factors on visible consumption.
 This has been the central theme for most of the studies surveyed in this
 note.
 More than to improve the measurement of visibility, the studies are interested
 in identifying the demographic parameters that explain the log-expenditure
 of visibility basket as is.
 The general regression equation for such a study is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (accumulated over the chosen visibility basket), 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure.
 Households with higher total expenditure are far more likely to be those
 with higher visible expenditure.
 Thus, total expenditure (on the right side of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lnvis_regression-1"

\end_inset

) makes it an endogenous variable for the dependent variable : 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(vis_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 A different approach is taken by Jaikumar et al who use weights in the
 basket rather than visible expenditure levels - so that visible expenditure
 is not subject to the endogeneity problem that arises due to total expenditure
 being on the right hand side and visible expenditure on left hand side
 of the equation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"

\end_inset

 (The proportion of visible expenditure with respect to the total expenditure
 could be the same for those with higher total expenditure and lower total
 expenditure).
 However, since data on income is often poor or sparse in the developing
 countries, total expenditure turns out to be the most frequent choice for
 a proxy of permanent income (
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a key control parameter for the analysis of visible consumption).
 In most of the studies, the said endogeneity of total expenditure is resolved
 by a choice of appropriate instruments - e.g.
 income, cubic-income, positive-income dummies or occupation codes.
 These instruments identified by Charles et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

 are reported to be quite strong in the studies surveyed as part of this
 note (Sargan and Wu-Hausman tests confirm endogeneity and the effectiveness
 of chosen instruments).

Heffetz finds that the degree to which people notice items explains the
 corresponding (permanent) income elasticities better.
 This observation has provided the basis for inspection of visible consumption
 in many studies thereforth.
 In an environment of inequalities, however, it is likely that i) the items
 available to higher status individuals may never be accessible to lower
 status individuals and ii) the individuals with perceived higher status
 may notice items differently from how the lower status individuals might
 notice them.
 The social factors thus relevant for the difference in visible preferences
 are sought in the studies on visible consumption in the developing countries.
 In India, these factors are religion and caste - while in South Africa
 and United States, race seems to have significance.
 The developing countries may also offer a less consumerist and less individuali
stic agrarian environment where expenditure is more visible than in a relatively
 more individualistic and industrialized society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

For visibility to bear significance in an environment of severe inequalities

 therefore perform a slightly more detailed survey by asking what an individual
 whose consumption is noticed would do when her income rises (by 20%).
 This quantifies the expectations from others associates the total expenditure
 with higher-income.
 The items where consumers expect the consumption to rise with increased
 income are those that associate with higher income and are declared

In a developing economy, the criterion for status consumption is clearly
 not just noticeability any more.
 Visible consumption may detail the mechanics of status competitions in
 a narrow sense where consumers participate in a market to increase their
 perceived status - but it does not provide an adequate picture of status
 consumption.
 One reason is that markets are underdeveloped in the developing world and
 social status is largely yielded through economic classes and social strata.
 The second - and probably more significant - reason is that status signaling
 does not exist in a society as an inherent need for visible appeal amongst
 humans.
 Instead visible consumption matters because of an item being associated
 with a higher status (in the sense which Veblen had talked about in his
 19th century treatise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The association of visibility with status is therefore essential to conspicuous
 consumption.
 In fact, Veblen's assertion that conspicuous goods are essentially futile
 happens to be helpful in ensuring the separability of the visible/status
 utility.
 By assuming that a visible (or conspicuous) good serves no utility other
 than of status, we can be that the item in consideration does not have
 any utilitarian value and combine all the products to talk about the status
 benefit that the consumer receives.
 The separability criterion unfortunately is not observed in all the literature
 around conspicuous consumption.
 It may be easy to claim that watches and make-up don't serve any utility
 other than status but it's difficult argue or measure how clear the status
 benefits from housing or shoes are.
 If the assumption of conspicuous goods being completely futile from a utilitari
an perspective is relieved, then combining the visible goods (as has been
 done in a lot of literature) is problematic (Corneo et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 skillfully us this assumption for a simple model for signaling).

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The view of status consumption we consider relevant for developing economies
 relies on Hirsch's idea of scarcity.
 We argue that status and scarcity of items must go hand in hand in a study
 of conspicuous consumption.
 Instead of limiting ourselves to visible consumption as the particular
 mechanics of status signaling - where consumers buy items in a common market
 and (presumably) over-weigh on items that are more noticeable - we attempt
 to understand the reasons behind status-signaling by looking at the differences
 in patterns between the richer and poorer sections of society and attempt
 to understand how unavailability of items (scarcity) as well as disparities
 of services across regions and classes in a society are reflected in both
 price and consumption of commodities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
This is not to discount a study of visible consumption or the importance
 of a visibility survey in any way.
 In fact, visible consumption that affects status competitions encompasses
 more than just scarcity - but there are severe measurement issues with
 the visibility of many status goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Before we attempt to measure just how scarce an item is, we must clarify
 the definition of scarcity for our purposes.
 Scarcity can be a confusing term since it encompasses both a so-called
 physical scarcity (unavailability) and the perceived scarcity (what we
 feel as scarce).
 For simplicity, we assume that all felt scarcities are physically scarce
 - or else consumers would acquire the item that is meant to be physically
 scarce.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 denotes the felt scarcities and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 the direct physical scarcities, then for our assertion 
\begin_inset Formula $F\subset S$
\end_inset

 doesn't make sense until we extend our notion of physical scarcity to include
 the barriers in society that may cause felt scarcities 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of attempting to define or measure felt scarcities 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 themselves, we expand the notion of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 to include barriers created through status competitions, advertising or
 other social-psychological communication than create the sense of urgent
 demand for a commodity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The perceptions of quality of life are entities that cannot be measured
 easily but still may qualify as felt scarcities.
 Our simplifying assumption allows us to look for parameters that can affect
 the demand for status items better.
 We surmise that conditions of availability, price and the rush (congestion)
 towards a new item must encompass all what we consider as barriers to a
 possession of an asset.
 The barriers of availability and price are relatively easy to measure -
 but the measurement of flocking towards an item - requires a formulation
 of status utility.
 We find such barriers - artificial or social - as a probabilistic concern
 which we discuss later in the study.
 The essential idea is that a commodity can indicate status through either
 being a snob type (where it has already been associated with high-status
 individuals in the past) or by being a bandwagon type item (where there
 is a clear competition to achieve a new item) 
\begin_inset Foot

If everybody has a certain item, then consumers may not consider it so important
 to acquire the item (since everyone else already has it) whereas for other
 types of item, consumers may rush to the item solely because there is a
 trend amongst everybody else to acquire.
 These are the snob and bandwagon types of item considered in the literature

Measuring Status Consumption in a Developing Economy

To measure positional consumption one can either split the consumer basket
 into positional and non-positional items or assign a status-utility to
 every commodity in the basket.
 For reasons cited in sub-section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Status-as-lagged-consumption"

\end_inset

, we choose the latter option.
 The criterion of classification of a status item (or assignment of such
 the status carrying power to every item) is inspired by Hirsch's notion
 of congestion - a herding of consumers to the desired commodity that drives
 scarcities and status consumption
\begin_inset Foot

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The criterion employed in assigning a status 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

advantage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of an item is the difference in prices (wherever available) of an item
 in the market.
 The more price differentiation exists, higher is the likelihood for the
 consumers to indicate status through purchase of higher priced item.
 Indeed, we rely on our claim that a consumer can indicate higher status
 by choosing the higher priced variety of an item.
 For items that are physically scarce, the price differences between commodities
 is less likely (although still possible due to distribution and storage
 costs involved) and every product whose varieties exists with different
 prices in a market is potentially a status good.
 In this simple formulation of status, therefore, prices (inferred or directly
 observed) are exogenous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since price is the simplest of all barriers to acquiring an item, a rough
 estimate of the price of an item may be a good indicator of whether that
 item can exhibit any status or not.
 Unfortunately, a detailed price information for all products is not available
 in consumption data.
 Relying on total quantity (
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

) consumed of an item or the expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $(e=q\cdot p)$
\end_inset

 on the item can obfuscate the sense of status consumption.
 If a consumer accumulates cheaper varieties of the an item instead of accumulat
ing the higher priced varieties of the item, the comparison of quantities
 would no longer provide an accurate representation of the status-related
 consumption.
 To illustrate with an example, if the prices of an item are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}(where\ p_{1}>p_{2})$
\end_inset

 - which can be consumed by 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}\cdot q_{A}<p_{2}\cdot q_{B}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{A}<e_{B})$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{A}<q_{B}$
\end_inset

, consumer B accumulates cheaper varieties of the item.
 If we don't observe 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}$
\end_inset

 directly but instead of total consumption on the item by 
\begin_inset Formula $A(=e_{A})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, then even 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{A}<e_{B}$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily imply that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 derives less status than 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 by consuming the variants of the same item.
 The status utility may not be the same for the two variants of the item
 with different prices.
 The choice of prices are therefore important (unless every variant of the
 item with a different price is treated as a separate item).
 In absence of observed prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}$
\end_inset

, one can instead estimate prices as 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{A}/q_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{B}/q_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 These prices (direct or inferred) must then be compare the richer quantiles
 of the population consume.
 Given our lagged asset view of status, we assert that whether a consumer
 accumulating cheaper varieties of an item gets more status than another
 consumer status depends on whether the consumers with higher assets (and
 thus higher status) also spend on the higher-priced varieties or not.
 More simply put, whether the higher priced variety of an item can indicate
 more status than a cheaper variety or not depends on how many people already
 above that person in the order of status or asset possession already have
 that item.
 For every consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and item 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}-max(p_{k})$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Formula $\times q_{i}$
\end_inset

 (negative by definition) can give us a rough estimate of the status that
 the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 may derive from the item.
 We can call this the 
\series bold
affordability
\series default
 factor for further reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that participation of consumers in the same market is key in the
 above argument of price differences.
 Certain items may have higher price varieties due to transport costs -
 so if the markets where consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 participate are affected by different supply-side issues then it would
 erroneous to consider status differences on grounds of price differences
 observed by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 All supply-side issues can be considered another barrier to status (which
 can either improve or affect status).
 By being in a region, neighborhood or social network where certain commodities
 are exclusively available, a consumer may be imparted status advantage
 (or disadvantage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emergence of new commodities is worth comment - since a new commodity
 that is not traditionally guarded by social networks may appear to change
 old barriers to status.
 The status advantage of a new commodity should also be explained by the
 affordability factor ( i.e.
 the commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}-max(p_{k})\cdot q$
\end_inset

).
 Electronic goods, cars, education or media could fall under this category
 of items.
 If we continue to assume that the market would be able to price a status
 commodity fairly (i.e.
 the new items introduced would have a price reflecting their status power).
 then we may treat the new entrant as a higher priced variety of an existing
 item category.
 While this may sound convincing, one cannot rule out instances where prices
 don't accurately represent the status benefits of the new item.
 That the market is able to set a fair price on a new entrant is a strong
 assumption 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A practical consideration is that for us to apply the affordability factor
 we also have to set the old categories of items generic enough to accommodate
 a new item as a higher price variant of a category.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In reality, a new entrant may take years to develop into a status product
 and could be a result of price changes as well as introduction of new products
 (possibly of lower quality) to let consumers subscribe to the item.
 The equilibrium value would be where the individuals are priced out of
 an item whose selling price can no longer be lowered with innovation.
 These are supply/firm concerns but matter if prices can no longer be considered
 as an accurate representation of status.
 Considering prices as exogenous, the only correction we apply is by observing
 the existing status of the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new commodity - after all - is often priced lower to attract customers.
 The status advantage of the new item thus introduced may be slightly lower
 when the item introduced is sufficiently lower in price (we assume that
 price represents quality).
 One may thus need a correction to the term 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}-max(p_{k})\cdot q$
\end_inset

 so that it reflects the status demand in addition to price difference.
 Since we're interested in the status utility of the new item, we can once
 again use the observation that the status advantage of an item is dependent
 on the status of individuals who already have access to it (or would have
 easier access to it).
 A new entrant in the market may be limited to exclusive social sections
 or be priced high enough to prevent lower income consumers from acquiring
 it - just the same as other items are.
 Let's assume there are 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 clusters in a society that are sorted by their income and asset ownership
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}>i_{2}>...>i_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 If all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 clusters observe the launch of a new product (e.g.
 a new phone category or a car), then we can consider a case such all sections
 with income rank lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{k}$
\end_inset

 would not have access to the new product.
 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 such cases possible and we can argue that not only would the market put
 a high price on the new entrant but might be compelled to introduce substitutes
 of the new entrant if 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is low (i.e.
 close to the lowest rank 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{n}$
\end_inset

).
 The advantage is still AF (without any correction related to existing status).
 If the consumer cannot access this item then the status advantage is clearly
 0.
 In this model, the status advantage is proportional to the price differences.
 One may require a slight adjustment of the difference formula of AF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider a numerical example.
 Let there be high, middle, low classes and two variants being sold as 10,20
 - which are accessible to high, middle.
 If middle classes consume 10, high classes 20, then the affordability factor
 becomes {-20q,-10q,0}.
 Now if a new commodity is introduced at 15, then only high class has access
 to it.
 If someone in high class or middle class switches to 15 then the AF becomes
 -5q instead of 0,-10q respectively (if all high classes together move to
 15 then 20 would be out of the market and the AF would remain 0).
 Now if a new commodity in the same category is introduced at 5 then everybody
 has access to it and the new distribution may be {-15q, -10q, 0} (assuming
 middle class and high class consume 10 and 20 respectively).
 The apparent 5q improvement for the lowest class could in fact amount to
 zero in reality.
 This the status is therefore just one-direction.
 Consumption increases for the new item but it doesn't sustain because the
 status advantage is minimal in the long-run.
 However, in the short-run the status advantage may be huge if the consumers
 haven't had the item for a long time (forcing the market to bring new status
 items with higher price).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, while the standard deviations away from the mean average expenditure
 may gives us a rough estimate of the status advantage associated with the
 item, we must continue to understand the segmentation in society that excludes
 a certain region or section of society from consuming certain items.
 The other correction...Notice that we don't use budget ratios 
\begin_inset Formula $(q/x)$
\end_inset

 in the analysis so far.
 This is because status determinants - i.e.
 assets and barriers must on consumption total consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 if an item has multiple prices) rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}/x_{i}$
\end_inset

 for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (which only matter for budgeting concerns).

 Measuring Availability and Affordability 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Scarcity is far too abstract an idea to measure - hence we consider a few
 parameters that may contribute to perceived scarcities.
 First, we assign a higher status value of a good in a wider region based
 on its consumption pattern in a smaller area where it is available and
 consumed - an item that is available in a smaller section of the population
 carries more status (all else being equal) than an item which is available
 to all (this view is inspired by both Veblen and Hirsch).
 In the developing countries, the issue of 
\series bold
availability
\series default
 is particularly relevant since rural areas are faced with unavailability
 of services and goods that are available (although limited) in the urban
 areas
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\paragraph_spacing single
This unavailability can spiral into severe demand pressures through pressures
 on urban migration.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the data from Tanzania, for example, we find not only that the region
 dummies are significant in consumption of certain items in the survey (particul
arly with respect to such as electricity which is completely unavailable
 in large parts of the country), but the availability of electricity seems
 to transform the income elasticities of demand for other expenditures as
 well (e.g.
 marriage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, a consumer also indicates status by choosing higher priced varieties
 of the item.
  If there is price differentiation in the market, all items that exhibit
 higher prices can provide status benefits to the user.
 This is encompassed in the idea of 
\series bold
affordability
\series default
 of the item (a statement of price of the item).
 While the difference in prices does bring some empirical issues - since
 it is not always clear whether one should treat the higher priced variety
 of the item as a separate item.
 To resolve this issue, we use the standard utility decomposition used in
 the survey (food, entertainment, housing etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Lastly, other than price-budget concerns (affordability) and issues of supply
 (availability), a status-signaling can be tracked by an item's demand in
 the richer sections of the society.
 Highly popular items (i.e.
 items with higher number of purchasers of the item in the population of
 consumers) can drive the appeal of the item down or up.
 Items like jewelry and luxury cars are those that cannot become extremely
 popular.
 If such items were to become popular, then the richer consumers would rush
 to something else that indicates their higher status.
 These items are known as snob items.
 Items which people rush to purchase - on the other hand - are called bandwagon
 items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
It is worth emphasizing that in a market where product differentiation exists,
 items can change from snob type to bandwagon type (or vice versa) over
 time.
 Items like new electronics are snob items when they're not affordable -
 but as they become more affordable with time they become bandwagon items.
 As consumers rush to them, they get replaced by a new snob item in the
 market.
  The effect of popularity of an item on to its demand can thus be in either
 direction i.e.
 limited supply would mean a higher appeal for snob items but high supply
 would mean less appeal.
 A time-series of expenditures can help us understand the trend in rushing
 towards certain items.
 The degree to which consumers rush to an item is termed as the 
\series bold
bandwagon effect
\series default
 - which too carries the status weight for a item
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\paragraph_spacing single
The snob or bandwagon effects must be seen in combination with affordability
 and availability.
 If the item is available and not affordable - then the price and budget
 constraints are more important than the bandwagon characteristics of the
 item.
 The snob or bandwagon nature of the item matters for an individual consumer
 only when it is affordable (thus potentially popular) as well as available.
 This is in accordance with the discussion in Section i.e.
 all direct physical scarcities are perceived scarcities.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The parameters availability, affordability and the bandwagon affect allow
 for a sorting order of all items in terms of status.
 Availability encompasses all issues that put an item in the market.
 Regional and supply-side issues thus affect availability.
 In absence of the data on supply of the items, we assign availability as
 a binary variable which is set to true in a region when the item appears
 in the consumption data for the region.
 Affordability, on the other hand, sums up price-related concerns on the
 demand-side.
 An item is affordable solely based on the price of the average consumption
 unit in the analysis of data.
 Further, the the bandwagon effect measures the effect of popularity of
 an item which may increase or decrease the consumption of an item based
 on to what extent an item is a bandwagon type item.
 An individual is likely to lose interest in a particular jewelry product
 if it the latter is available and affordable to everybody.
 In the Hirschian terminology
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 social scarcities are realised through affordability and popularity.

For every individual an item is more affordable if its cost is within the

\begin_inset Formula $x$

 The primary reason for choosing a method based on total cost spent on the
 item is the unavailability of quantities of consumption in the diary recall
 section - where only total costs of the item have been collected (rather
 than prices or quantities).
 Semantically, affordability is a statement of price in the market and should
 be calculated from the average price of the item.
 Thus, the total expenditure and the unit quantity
\series bold
 
\series default
of the item (consumed on average) is all what one may need to measure affordabil
ity.
 In absence of the average quantity consumed, we can approximate the quantity
 by scaling the consumption with household size.
 The price of the unit quantity (or the scaled average cost) relative to
 the average total expenditure gives us a measure of affordability.

\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 consumers (i.e.
 for item 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 amongst total  number of items the average price as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}\frac{q_{i}}{\Sigma_{k,n}^{K}q_{k,n}}$
\end_inset

 ) relative to the average total expenditure .
 If the ratio of average expenditure on AC with respect to the permanent
 income amongst those who buy AC (i.e.
 the cost of AC divided by the total expenditure) is higher than than the
 respective value for electricity, then AC would be considered less affordable
 than electricity.
 That electricity is an expendable item and consumed immediately (as opposed
 to AC which is an asset) is ignored in this model.
 Also, the dependency amongst items is ignored in this view (i.e.
 that one cannot consume A.C.
 without consuming electricity is not a relevant consideration for affordability
).

\begin_layout Standard
The role of asset vs expendable goods is worth commenting.
 It may seem momentarily that an asset should carry more status than the
 consumption as the former is more difficult o acquire.
 However, there are few reasons to believe that an asset priced as low as
 the consumption item would carry more status.
 Assets do carry more status than consumption of an item - but because of
 i) higher price barrier to asset ownership (which also bring security through
 resale of the item) ii) other barriers to asset ownership.
 Local markets - in the drive to help provide more options to the consumer
 - may further discourage asset ownership by limiting themselves to low-price
 consumption (a substitution effect that works against a bandwagon asset)
 than asset.
 This makes asset remain less available and consumption more.
 In other words, consumption is more available than asset to begin with.
 It being more affordable further limits asset ownership.
 A less affordable item that provides status advantage (because of being
 new or rare) can make the goal of owning an asset even more difficult.
 More affordable items bear less status unless they're rare or new i.e.
 are less available or have bandwagon qualities - which is the subject of
 the next subsection.

As a side-note, we also find that the prices can be significantly different

Price is not enough - because we actually don't have price for a lot of
 items.
 If we did (as is the case for food), we could classify the items as possibly
 status-indicating or not - but we can't - so we look for inferred price
 of items and reckon that the inferred prices away from the stdev are higher
 price.

The bandwagon effect of an item measures how strongly an item's demand would
 increase as an item becomes more popular.
 If new buyers are being added to an item (after accounting for price decrease
 and income increase), then we have a clear indication that the consumers
 are flocking to the item.
 The analysis follows that for the substitution effect.

Tanzania is the first country to be analysed in the study.
 With recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, the country
 provides a much desired snapshot of the consumer world of developing sub-Sahara
n Africa.
 The data chosen for the preliminary analysis is from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) conducted by the World Bank.
 LSMS includes expenditure microdata from about 10,000 households - with
 many of the expenditure categories of potential <<<<<<<<visible value.
 With no verifiable measure of visibility, all expenditure not related to
 food and utilities is evaluated for potentially visibility>>>>>>>>>>>>.
 These chosen categories from LSMS are listed in Table

The income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

.
 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.

Effect of occupation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Income data in LSMS is not available for all the surveyed households.
 This may indicate the presence of informal sector in Tanzania.
 A few occupations in the survey are neither well defined nor are truly
 an indicator of total income.
 The presence of categories like unpaid-family-work and of individuals with
 no-primary-job getting a significant income from their secondary occupations
 makes the task of associating the primary occupation of the household head
 with her income rather difficult (i.e.
 occupation - which is available for all household heads cannot be used
 as a proxy of household income - which is not available for all households
 in the survey).
 Grouping the occupations into fewer categories than in the survey (by putting
 paid/unpaid family work and agriculture under the same category for example)
 allows for the smoothening of the effect of individual occupations and
 may serve as a proxy of socioeconomic classes in the country.
 Without or without this grouping, the effect of occupation has been found
 significant on the consumption of scarce commodities.
 The results are shown in Table

Effect of Education Level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
One of the claims to be evaluated on the LSMS data is whether education
 has a significant effect on visible consumption.
 If the education level of NA is considered as none (for nearly 30% of the
 recorded individuals), then highest education level of the household held
 is found quite significant for many commodities.
\end_layout

Effect of Immigration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
With a significant migration from rural areas, one of the claims to be tested
 is whether those resident in the community spend less on positional consumption.
 While this does seem be to be a significant factor, it has a weaker effect
 than age or household size (which is to be further split as number of children
 and the number of members minus the number of children) .

Urbanization Effects

 of rural-urban areas do not reflect the consumer markets so well.
 Still,

 dummy is found significant for house-rent and electricity (since most of
 rural Tanzania does not have electricity - See Table

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
If one were to use a dummy for accessible markets (created using the distance
 from the surveyed household location to the closest daily market ) - the
 effect of such a dummy is not so significant on positional consumption.
 The region dummies - on the other hand - are found to have more significance
 - indicating regional disparities for conspicuous consumption in the country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\paragraph_spacing single
Population density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Population density is a crude measure for crowding in the cities.
 The regions with higher population density do have a slight effect on consumpti
on of scarce commodities.
 It is hoped that a urban/rural dummy created by classifying districts based
 on their population densities (or at a finer granularity than regional
 levels) may give a more detailed view on the effect of population density
 on conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

Household size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of a spatially or economically excluded area with with denser
 urban areas provides further insights on status competitions.
 Testing whether the proxies of social interaction (family members etc.)
 have an impact on status-related consumption, we find there are many products
 that seem likely to have signaling effects but for which number of family
 members is not statistically significant.

Services as Visible Consumption

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
One of the interesting observations in the Vindex survey (Heffetz

) is the clustering of services and products.
 It is found that services tend to be less 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in the Western consumer world.
 The clustering might not be as clear-cut in the developing world - where
 social stratification is severe and many services are contractual (non-monetary
).
 The socio-cultural barriers might have an effect through access to services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Towards that claim, English education as a control parameter is found quite
 significant for positional consumption.
 Those who identify themselves as English speakers tend to spend more on
 scarce commodities.
 This indicates that English education may be quite scarce - and while it
 isn't reflected in the consumer expenditure market data so easily - it's
 likely to play a role in status competitions.

While a commodity for private consumption (e.g.
 skin-cream or hobby-equipment in the LSMS data) might have an appeal for
 everyone - whether it signals high-status or not is a social psychological
 concern and cannot be assessed from the household survey by itself.
 In the absence of a visibility survey (asking the respondents how much
 they notice a product and whether they associate the product with high-income
 or not), one may still continue the discussion of the potential conspicuous
 value of items by looking at how scarce the item is (based on the percentile
 of consumers of the commodity).
 This is akin to repeating the analysis of visible expenditure with a given
 commodity as the only constituent of the visibility basket.
 The percentile of consumers using a given commodity (e.g.
 top 22% for electricity) and the slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(commodity-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $log(total-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 can tell us if richer sections of society spend more on a certain commodity
 and if the poorer sections of society consume the chosen commodity at all
 (the commodities chosen in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 are those where this slope is significant).
 The regression based on data prepared from the last step attempts to calculate
 the coefficients of the following equation:

 A column in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 also suggests the percentile of consumers using the commodity (electricity
 for example is used amongst those having top 22% of total expenditure).
 The usage of commodities such as skincream and other-personal-products
 (shampoos, razors etc.) are widespread compared with sports or hobby equipment
 and electricity.
 For commodities that are rare and consumed only amongst the richer sections
 of the society (those with higher total expenditure) the effect of English
 literacy is significant.
 Similarly, hsize has a significant effect on both educational expense and
 personal products (using number of children instead of hsize could provide
 better association with education expense).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
We cannot claim from the results that the population spends more on status
 commodities than education.
 What we can claim however, is that electricity is more scarce than education.
 Further, in areas where food is expensive, spending on marriage reduces
 - particularly by the occupations that may bring higher incomes.
 This marks a preference towards industrial goods in the urban (expensive)
 areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Another observation that can possibly help in modeling scarcity is that
 scarcity of items seems to occur in clusters of objects.
 Carpets-rugs require a certain housing status and access to English depends
 on region.
 Similarly, many hobby equipment may require access to electricity etc.
 The clustering of these items essentially point to the urban-rural differences
 in the country.

\begin_layout Standard

If consumption pressures are explained by the level of urbanization, population

Further discussion - Price of food vs non-food items
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The literature has not used panel data analysis in the context of conspicuous
 consumption.
 While an influence of rising prices can complicate the analysis of visible
 consumption indicators, the insights from demand elasticities are essential
 to understanding the relative effect of status-related consumption against
 other commodities.
 Higher price of food items may suppress consumption on food - but one cannot
 answer whether an increase in price of food suppresses its consumption
 more than it suppresses consumption of non-food items or not - without
 an estimation of demand elasticities.
 Such details of consumption patterns are basket-dependent and are not accessibl
e without a record of prices of all types of items in the basket.
 Unfortunately, a lack of prices for non-food items in the LSMS prevent
 this much desired time-series analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Even though an analysis on non-food prices is inaccessible with the unavailabili
ty of price data in most consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS), a time-series analysis based on food prices alone can provide insights
 into the pressures on food consumption.
 Using historical prices on calorie consumption in India, Deaton and Jean
 Dreze point out that the overall calorie consumption has declined while
 the total outlay has increased in India (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"

\end_inset

).
 The change in positional value of food - determined by price differentiation
 in the market and scarcity - can potentially help explain some of this
 decline.
 While such a decline is reported to be less in the case of sub-Saharan
 African countries than in India, the regional differences within the country
 could be explained by the change of food's position in the consumer universe
 (i.e.
 the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Congestion - a related phenomenon - is subject to demand and supply for
 a particular commodity and can be measured.
 If we were to consider food, for example, a limited supply and overpopulation
 can increase competition.
 Similarly, for entertainment, censorship and introduction of internet can
 create new competitions (congestion).
 For housing, new constructions and overpopulation can cause congestion.
 These are commodity-specific instances and a focus on selected items may
 be the only way to test whether the changes in consumption patterns for
 the chosen commodity are explained by new scarce items and the competition
 caused for them.
 The data from Tanzania - so far - only seems to point that availability
 of services in urban and rural area can potentially cause some congestion
 (competitions for scarce items).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Scarcity is interpreted in terms of availability, affordability and bandwagon
 effects in the study.
 The geographical regions may need to be understood in terms of scarcity.
 Further, population density and migration data may provide better insights
 in the interplay of food and non-food consumption.
 We find that in certain areas in Tanzania - prices for food vary a lot
 more than they do in others.
 This is a phenomenon that varies from commodity to commodity.
 For example, the prices for onions and sugar don't vary so much by area
 code as they do for meat and chicken.
 The regions Dar-es-salaam, Mbeya mwanza, Mjini/Magharini unguja stand out
 for higher prices for multiple items.
 In a preliminary analysis, a indicator dummy for these regions is found
 significant - but it is also noted that these areas are urban settlements
 where electricity is available and population is significantly high (See
 Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Certain food items for example, have more price-differences overall than
 others - rice (husked), maize(grain), sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, groundnut
s(shelled), goat meat, chicken and canned milk correspond to numerous (>4)
 region-codes where they're reportedly sold in different prices ranges.
 While it is tempting to claim that price differences in the market indicate
 that there is more price-differentiation and possibly more competition
 - one needs to consider the overall scarcity of the commodity (the percentiles
 of the commodity expenditure in the threshold method) as well as the preference
 for the item amongst the rich (measured by higher expenditure with income)
 for the item to be considered a status-signaling item.

Utility and Status - extensions to the model for appeal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The concept of status is rather non-trivial and has characteristics of a
 feedback system in the long-run (status may yield income through social
 barriers but requires income to be acquired).
 The Ireland model used in the literature treats status-signaling as purchasing
 of visible and non-visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

.
 In the Ireland model, the combined utility for every consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $U=F(f(v,w),s)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)$
\end_inset

 is the private utility of the consumer and status 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be an increasing function of inference of others - 
\begin_inset Formula $s=f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - with 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 denoting visual consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 - the consumption that is not directly observable.
 Every consumer thus optimizes the combined private and visible utility.
 A practical consideration in the model is the separation between visible
 and non-visible consumption - a boundary that requires a socio-cultural
 judgment and has been drawn using consumer surveys in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
What research in the developing markets further points out is that the parameter
 of combined utility in a simplified model - (
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)\cdot f(v,w)+a\cdot f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - can vary for different sections of society.
 A slight adjustment of the model may be to add another parameter that indicates
 the consumer's social class.
 This may be relevant in the developing world where social status is yielded
 through social barriers.
 Sections of society that are endowed with a higher status capital may be
 in less of a need to purchase commodities of visible consumption.

In the analysis of LSMS data on Tanzania so far, urban/rural differences
 have significance in the consumption of scarce commodities.
 There are two ways to incorporate this into a model of signaling - one
 is to consider these household characteristics as a social class of consumers
 so that different sensitivities for social classes is noted.
 The other is to consider these characteristics as part of conspicuous consumpti
on in the long-run.
 For example, English literacy seems to have correlation with the consumption
 of certain scarce products in Tanzania.
 In the model of scarcity, English literacy (along with urban residence
 and other characteristics significant for consumption of scarce commodities)
 would be seen as a status commodity (capital) that is acquired through
 spending on education or migration (or other relevant commodities).
 The latter is the approach to be followed in the extensions to the appeal
 model in Section

\begin_layout Standard

Notice that one needs to be careful while drawing conclusions based on consumpti
on of commodities that are themselves selected based on the percentiles
 of consumption levels.
 The threshold method that we use to select scarce commodities (that are
 likely to be visible) - considers items that i) are accessible by no more
 than 50% of the consumers and ii) have their expenditure rising with permanent
 income.
 These are - by definition - items that the rich are more likely to afford.
 We cannot select items that the only richer section of society indulges
 in and claim that people spending on these selected items indicate higher
 status.
 Such a claim is only a restatement of the high permanent income and says
 nothing more substantial than that the richer population sections signal
 higher status.
 It would be a fallacy to associate visible consumption with household character
istics by only associating household characteristics with permanent income.
 The threshold method that we use only measures the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

scarcity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the item (e.g.
 electricity is more scarce than food) - not status or visibility per se
 - which involve some socio-cultural judgment.
 That scarcity itself has an indirect effect on status competitions cannot
 be denied - but this effect is not measured by the threshold method of
 classifying alone.

In recent decades, the urban settlements in Africa have seen massive overpopulat

 The differences in urban-rural lifestyles have increased.
 The scarcity of services and of industrial goods (which would be a necessity
 in the Western world) seem evidently sparse in the developing countries
 (a claim that is verified by data on Tanzania).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A relevant question amidst these developments is whether a consumer prefers
 a larger house over installation of electricity or not.
 As a commodity, electricity is both scarce and visible - as it opens up
 more lifestyle choices.
 A survey detailed in the next sections aims to test the presence of a preferenc
e for electricity (and other scarce goods) - but as is, the data suggests
 significant urban-rural differences across regions in Tanzania.
 In a Hirschian sense, a congestion

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A general view on scarcity would allow us to classify the commodities based
 on their scarcity and quantify the urban-rural differences better.
 The survey detailed in next sections may further help measure the impact
 of such scarcities on consumer preferences.
 It is noted that many of the items are scarce together (carpets and housing-sta
tus, electricity and hobby equipment, etc.) .
 It is through such denial of goods and services that status perceptions
 develop.
 A simple view of observed scarcities can be provided by a directed graph
 of items for classification - where a node is an item and points to other
 nodes/items that it denies (which themselves can be formed with items that
 deny other items and so and so forth).
 For example, electricity can be a node in this graph with connections to
 equipment and electronics but no connection to food items.
 The disconnected nodes in the graph - would be least likely to be affected
 by another unreachable node in the graph.
 The criteria of connections (denials) would be determined by statistical
 significance e.g.
 rice and walnuts appear would not be scarce together if one of them is
 available and affordable by both higher and lower quantiles of permanent
 income of society.

Linear Budget Constraint - General restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The linear-budget in the demand theory poses some constraints on the demand
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x,p)$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the quantity demanded, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the total expenditure and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the vector of prices).
 The key budget constraints are the homogeneity constraint (
\begin_inset Formula $q(\theta x,\theta p)=\theta q(x,p)$
\end_inset

) and the adding-up constraint (
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma p_{k}q_{k}=x)$
\end_inset

.
 The adding-up constraint is often written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma p_{k}\frac{\partial q_{k}}{\partial x}=1;\ \Sigma p_{k}\frac{\partial g_{k}}{\partial p_{i}}=-q_{i}$
\end_inset

 (for a good 
\begin_inset Formula $i\epsilon[1,n]$
\end_inset

) while the homogeneity restriction as: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{k}\frac{p_{k}}{q_{i}}\frac{\partial q_{i}}{\partial p_{k}}-x\frac{\partial q_{i}}{\partial x}=0$
\end_inset

These theoretical constraints aren't automatically true for empirical data.
 Instead, their validity needs to be tested.
 For example, in the Working-Leser model - which provides a simple demand
 function (as well as the corresponding Engel curve) with the budget share
 dependent on total expenditure alone ( 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\beta\cdot log\ x_{i}+\alpha$
\end_inset

 where total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum p_{i}q_{i}$

, budget share
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$

 are regression coefficients) - one needs to make sure that the adding-up
 and homogeneity restrictions apply on the data (i.e.

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma\beta_{i}=0$

d the differences in consumption patterns.
 The measurement of differences in consumption of expensive and cheap varieties
 of a commodity was termed as the quality-coefficient (an intuition relevant
 to conspicuous consumption as well).
 Analyzing the tea-consumption in the UK, for example, they concluded that
 the small-size families spend proportionately higher on expensive tea varieties

 The change in quantity consumed is explained in terms of of quantity vs
 quality changes as :

 (change in quality - indicated by price and change in quantity indicated

 This leads to

Shape of the utility curve - Particular Restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The restrictions of adding-up and homogeneity are often too general to provide
 any meaningful interpretation of utility.
 The empirical work therefore often involves further restrictions on the
 shape of utility curves.
 The most important property of the utility curve arises out of the revealed
 preference model - which assumes that for set of choices 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 may be 
\shape italic
always
\shape default
 preferred in presence of both 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, if 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 is 
\shape italic
revealed
\shape default
 as preferred to item 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 would be preferred to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 even if the consumer was compensated more.
 This was originally proposed by Samuelson and then extended to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 items by Houthakker.
 The demand functions ( 
\begin_inset Formula $q=g(x)$
\end_inset

 ) are well behaved when revealed preference applies - and lead to the Slutsky
 equations (that give us the matrix of substitution effects) - which can
 be summarised as the negative-semi-definiteness of the substitution matrix
 and the symmetry of cross-substitution effects

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In the context of conspicuous consumption, the preferences are expected
 to be comparable and transitive.
 The axiom of revealed preference is also expected to hold i.e.
 when an item is revealed preferred to another item - then more income would
 continue to maintain that item preferred.
 Assuming any further restrictions on the utility curves may require a theoretic
al justification as well as the empirical tests associated with assumption
 of the shape of the utility curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A commonly used restriction is that of separability.
 A convenient way to think of separability (and the necessary and sufficient
 conditions for it
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The necessary and sufficient condition for separability is the marginal
 rate of substitution between any two variables in the same group being
 independent of a variable in any other group.
\end_layout

\end_inset

) is to view it as a hierarchy of needs - i.e.
 a utility tree - where needs are split into multiple groups - each of which
 further expands into sub-groups which themselves eventually expand into
 individual items.
 Separability implies that the items in each group can be rearranged within
 the group by the consumer without affecting the items in other groups at
 the same level in the tree (except through the effect of the expenditure
 associated with the item on the total income).
 An aggregation of all groups moving upwards in the tree gives us the final
 utility - a process that is equivalent to the combination of sub-utility
 functions that each of the branch in the tree corresponds to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
When separability applies, the optimal utility problem amounts to optimising
 sub-utility functions i.e.
 the utility in each group.
 For every group 
\begin_inset Formula $r\epsilon G$
\end_inset

, the consumer is meant to optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u_{r},p_{r})=min[x=\sum q_{i}p_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{r}(x,p_{r})=u_{r}]$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{r}$
\end_inset

 in these problems would be chosen subject to the combined utility function
 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{G}$
\end_inset

 such that the consumer optimises:

\begin_layout Standard

The problem can be easily solved if the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{g\epsilon G}$

 are known from all individual items, but when this is not possible, some
 further restrictions must exist for us to solve this so-called

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 One possible restriction is the 
\begin_inset Formula $C(u_{G},p_{G})$
\end_inset

 being of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{G}(u_{G})\cdot b_{G}(u_{G})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{G}$
\end_inset

 is a monotone increasing function 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{G}$

 This restriction requires that the budget shares be independent of total
 expenditure - hence one cannot group necessities and luxuries together

 The second solution is the Gorman polar form where the indirect utility

If conspicuous items were considered as a group, then separability of such
 a group from other groups of utility such as entertainment, education or
 even food may not be possible.
 This is because an item can be of both conspicuous and a more utilitarian
 value at the same time.
 The condition for an separable group - after all - is that a consumer can
 order the items within the group without considering an item outside the
 group (except through the effect of the item in the group to the consumer's
 total budget).
 In case of a group comprising of conspicuous items, a consumer can order
 items within the group of conspicuous items with considering any item outside
 the group (of non-conspicuous items) only if i) the difference between
 conspicuous and non-conspicuous items is clear and ii) all conspicuous
 items don't belong in any other group.
 In reality, all items reachable within the budget may be of some conspicuous
 value to the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To illustrate this idea, let's assume that we have only the following items
 in the consumer universe: cigarettes, cheap and expensive varieties of
 fruits and cinema.
 Signaling preference order for one consumer might be cigars
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

cinema
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

expensive fruits
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

 cheap fruits.
 The status needs may be fulfilled for the consumer by either expenditure
 on cinema or on cigar.
 Another consumer might be satisfied with expensive fruits for the status
 need.
 All consumers can achieve different statuses or signaling benefits from
 several items.
 Status is typically derived from a collection of items - the idea of every
 item imparting a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

signaling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 utility often makes little sense.
 To model the group of conspicuous items is to model the mechanism that
 indicates status - which is indicated by consumers trying to associate
 themselves to a richer (or high status) group of individuals through expenditur
e (this view of status consumption derives from the literature on snob and
 bandwagon items

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Status isn't an ordinal concept.
 Further, it is even difficult to obtain a one-dimensional view of status
 - both education and watches can indicate status - of different kinds.
 It may be possible to model status as a configuration of top varieties
 of all other groups - an idea that too deviates from separability.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus the utility of a status good is bound to overlap with that of other
 goods - and the status items can be considered separable only if the visible
 items selected in the visible groups don't affect other groups at all (given
 the boundary of visible and non-visible items is clear).
 For our example, if somebody chooses cinema alone for visibility, then
 separability is achieved - whereas if one uses expensive potatoes and tomatoes
 for indicating status, then an overlap with food takes place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A stronger form of separability is additivity which is also ruled out for
 conspicuous items.
 However, if one can organize consumer universe in terms of non-conspicuous
 and conspicuous groups, strong separability (or even additivity) of groups
 can make sense (this is indeed used in the Ireland model

 It is worthwhile nevertheless to see whether conditions for separability
 are met empirically or not (by measuring marginal rate of substitution

\begin_layout Section
Motivation for a model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One cannot be sure whether the real differences in assets actually cause
 perception of status differences.
 In fact if in two societies A and B, people in A perceived same status
 differences as those in B despite different levels of inequalities in A
 and B - we wouldn't know unless the consumption on a standardized basket
 is compared with.
 This standardization itself must adjust itself for status perception since
 the standard basket itself is dependent on how much spending is done on
 what item.
 This is the source of the circular problem.
 To resolve this problem of the circular definition (status perceptions
 determining what's a status good and consumption on them contributing to
 status) requires a better feedback model.
 A status score 
\begin_inset Formula $r\epsilon(0,1)$
\end_inset

 is imparted by consumption vector 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and personal characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 We need to stop thinking of status good as a separate type in this model.
 We should instead assume that all items can impart status (in fact they
 do) and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 satisfies the status utility.
 In a simple model, 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be 0) and rank-category 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 In societies A and B, we can argue that if people in A perceive less status
 differences than those in B, then they would get less status utility from
 the same standardized vector 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 in B.
 The consumption can be standardized and compared only by talking about
 the proportions spent on each such-utility.
 This assumes the utility to be separable (so that one can see what portion
 of budget is spent on which sub-utility).
 If all items indicate status - we should be able to tell by the total rank
 of every individual indicated by the function r (which depends on q and
 the of every category c of every quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 consumed as well as assets and income).
 We still need to see how rank is summed up over all quantities consumed.
 Rank then is only a matter of fitting the consumption to differences in
 factors that influence status.
 The category 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 as well and actual rank is a matter of fitting in this model.
 If everyone spends the same amount on an item regardless of how rich they
 are and they don't flock to an item then that item is less likely to be
 of status significance than an item where the consumers do.
 1.3 Notice that we define status difference as an ontological entity - encompass
ing means of showing status (i.e.
 money, items to show off etc.) rather than the perception of status itself.
 If an item like a leather shoe exists because there would be some people
 who are spending a lot on it (even if the markets are imperfect to use
 product differentiation and float higher-price varieties of the item).
 More consumption or newer consumption should attempt to level the differences
 in assets and income - by letting consumers indicate status in alternative
 ways.
  1.4.
 One possible criticism is that we don't know whether new items are used
 for reasons other than status.
 It could be that people are just interested in new items or rare items
 - not necessarily knowing that it may indicate status.
 That is indeed valid objection - the counter-argument is only that status
 is constituted in expressing these desires.
 This is why only can materialise most human desires is usually the one
 with higher status.
 The essential goal of the defining a status good is decomposing the ontological
 sense of status into the desire for rare item and less achievable items.
 The item certainly needs to be visible - but to determine how visible an
 item - we break down the status further into more categories.

\begin_layout Standard
The determinants tor possessions of status other than consumption include
 assets owned, family income and personal characteristics such as education,
 race, caste or class.
 Let quantities consumed be 
\begin_inset Formula $q$

\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $r=\phi(r_{C},r_{A},r_{\rho},r_{P})$

 The net rank in status determinants (or status utility) is thus a combination
 of both consumption rank (status utility derived from consumption) and
 rank of rest of the status determinants (status utility derived from rest

 These three parameters represent the immediate status needs of the consumer
 - they are all what what a consumer may consider in purchasing a status
 item and address her status needs.
 The consumer does not consider the personal characteristics or other barriers
 in consuming items or owning assets - since the barriers from personal
 characteristics are constant in the short-run.

The steps for data analysis are therefore the following:

\begin_inset Formula $r_{C},r_{A}$
\end_inset

 based on the ternary vector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Record 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and compute barriers for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

(treat personal characteristics such as caster or race as Inf) - for simplicity
 assume 
\begin_inset Formula $r=r_{C}+r_{A}+r_{\rho}+r_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\rho_{t+1}}=\beta_{t+1}\rho_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In a status through personal characteristics-only world, barriers - which
 we assume to be the same for everybody - increase when more people get
 rich or have high-status (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t}$
\end_inset

 can be substituted with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 since personal characteristics are constant over the horizon except for
 education which can be treated in consumption or assets).
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{t+1}=\beta_{t}+\alpha$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{t}\rho_{t+1}>r_{\rho_{t}}$
\end_inset

 else 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{t+1}=\beta_{t-1}-\alpha$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{t}\rho_{t+1}<r_{\rho_{t}}$
\end_inset

.
 The other constraint comes from combining the utility as well.
 In this model, the combined utility is 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{C}+r_{C}+u_{A}+r_{A}+r_{\rho}$
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{A}$
\end_inset

 are utilities in the classical sense ,while 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{C}=\tau_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{A}=\tau_{A}$
\end_inset

 are rank utilities.
 Notice that personal characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

don't provide any utility in the classical sense.
 This is the only point illustrated by the formulation.
 In the ordinal sense, we don't need to see anything except the partial
 order of items for consumption (which is a judgment based on both rank
 and classical utility).
 The u and r might still be required since we want the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\rho,t},\beta_{A,t},\beta_{C,t}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t},A_{t}q_{t}$
\end_inset

 depend on the correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t-1},A_{t-1}q_{t-1}$
\end_inset

.
 We may use a Cobb-douglas utility function in the regular sense but the
 shape of the utility function is best left for calibration (we don't know
 for sure whether utility without status is of the Cobb-Douglas form).
 One way to approach this is to simply the model and claim that only personal
 characteristics carry status (a personal doesn't have high status but the
 higher status has him) - assets and consumption are only important in the
 sense that they put you close to those the characteristics of the rich.
 The barrier is then simply the mapping from spending and assets onto the
 personal characteristics (those with lower assets consistently spiral into
 lower).
 A three person simulation can be done to understand this model.
 In a preliminary two persons model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1},c_{1}A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{2},c_{2},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 we can assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\rho_{1})=s(\rho_{2})$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 statuses are the same in the beginning.
 But if 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}>c_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}$
\end_inset

 for at least one cycle, then 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\rho_{1})>s(\rho_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 This dissimilarity would mean that even if 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}=c_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the next cycle, 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\rho_{1})>s(\rho_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 This simplified model is too simple in the sense that is one class per
 person and the person cannot change his/her class.
 One needs to consider more than two persons and two classes for the model
 to make sense.

While modeling the felicity function across multiple time-periods, one must
 understand that status goods don't just grow in value (at a constant interest-r
ate 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

) but they also increase the probability of promotion to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 One cannot assume independence across multiple time periods because the
 probability of promotion (for kids) through consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is cumulative - with the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-promotion increasing later in life (for kids).
 The probability increases through personal characteristics such as proximity,
 education or social networks.
 These can be modeled with the correlation of assets and consumption with
 personal characteristics.
 The overall correlation must reflect social mobility (i.e.
 if there is social mobility among identified classes the correlation should
 be less).
 Asset and consumption contribute to the probability of promotion to higher
 status (higher correlation with status determinants and lower probability
 of coming down from the high status).
 Assets there don't just grow in value at a certain rate, but they also
 increase the probability of promotion just the way consumption and personal
 characteristics would.
 Modeling the correlation and the probability of coming down from the ladder
 needs to be parametrised in the model.
 Further, only a time-series can tell us about how much promotion of status
 determinants has actually occurred (i.e.
 mobility achieved) and whether consumption is attempting to bridge the
 gap.
 A higher status is implied only by the personal characteristic of the individua
l (identity to a social group is key).
 Once this high status is achieved, the probability of losing the assets
 and consumption becomes lower.
 This would mean that people with higher status should have a lower probability
 of losing wealth than those in the model.
 This would also need to be tested.
 Upgrades in status in this probabilistic model is not the same as an upgrade
 in personal characteristics.
 Therefore a promotion in personal characteristics is not necessary to gain
 a promotion in status.
 Further, an absence of probability of status promotion implies a classless
 society - where the intertemporal substitution model is without uncertainty
 and is limited to deciding between asset and consumption based on the life-cycl
e model (factoring in number of children).

The probability of status mobility models the ubiquitous behaviour of use
 of status goods to promise social networks.

A survey quantifies a lot of complex interactions in what constitutes status
 competitions in a society.
 A luxury item - for example - needs to be marketed as a luxury for it to
 both impart visible signals to others and to improve self-perception of
 the buyer.
 In Veblen's original framework, for a product to indicate status it must
 be rare and superfluous (thus serve as an exploit).
 That a watch is more noticeable than an insurance policy (and associated
 with higher income) is not entirely relevant to this framework.
 Moreover, whether a poor person buying a cheap watch and a richer person
 buying a watch that is far more expensive (and probably subject to import
 restrictions) are both instances of conspicuous consumption or not depends
 on the context that the observer chooses.
 Cheap watches may or may not constitute conspicuous consumption - depending
 on the social welfare function.

Regressors and instruments in implementation of ivreg in R-toolbox AER are
 specified in a formula with two parts on the right-hand side.
 The specification - used in this note - can be either of the form -

\family default
or as 
\family typewriter
y ~ ex + en | .
 - en +in 
\family default
(where

 (with black-dummy and coloured-dummy), the coefficients for coloured and
 black are negative (i.e.
 black and coloured social groups spend less on visible consumption than
 the white population).
 However, these coefficients flip signs after adding income controls(II)

 The endogeneity of total expenditure requires instrumentation - Kaus uses
 instruments suggested by Charles, Roussanov and Hurst - including positive-inco
me-dummy, cube-of-income-level, dummies for under-secondary-education, secondary
-education and degree-education.
 Kaus then performs two 2SLS regressions - one with income controls and
 total-expenditure as control variables

The first-change of sign when income controls are added implies that after
 accounting for income of household head, the coloured and black groups
 spend more on visible consumption.
 Total expenditure is not a perfect proxy of permanent income - which justifies
 instrumentation.
 After resolving these endogeneity concerns - with a regression of visible
 expenditure as dependent variable and total-expenditure as one of the control
 variables - the signs are revised - although 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 does not change a lot.
 Adding demographic controls to the 2SLS regression - shows significance
 of age, urban/rural area and family size - but coefficients are still not
 lowered significantly.
 This confirms that coloured and black social groups spend a rather disproportio
nate amount on visible consumption.
 Kaus paper is interested in testing whether the rise in average group income
 reduces the visible consumption.
 The regression considers average-incomes of particular provinces for every
 group (black/white/coloured).
 This regression shows the effect more on black-social-group than the white-soci
al-group - a difference that author argues points out alternate ways of
 signaling for white-social-group relative to black-social-group.

 The hispanic dummy is inferred by the

 variable in CEX data - which is recorded side-by-side with the race variable.
 This means that households/individuals can associate with either white
 or black while recording their ethnicity.
 Only about 1489 out of 22980 households surveyed in years 2004, 2009 and
 2014, for example, associate with neither white nor black.
 If that criterion is relaxed (i.e.
 if anyone reporting the horref1 variable is considered hispanic for the
 study) the number of Hispanics in the survey almost doubles.

Methods to measure Visibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The direct way of measuring visibility is to find an evidence of visibility
 in the commodities.
 Most studies have relied on their own visibility surveys.
 In absence of such a survey, one can verify commodities from public media
 - e.g.
 advertisements or social media traffic.
 These methods have not been pursued at this stage in the study.

Consumption percentiles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The differences between amounts spent by the lowest and higher percentile
 of spenders of a particular commodity are expected to be higher when a
 commodity is a status-good than when it is of common utility.
 The illustrations show non-zero log-level expenditure on a few commodities
 when the lower (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

) percentile of the consumption of the commodity is ignored.
 Ignoring the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile of the consumption of a visible commodity is equivalent to treating
 the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile expenditure as non-visible consumption (If we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=10\%$
\end_inset

 for electricity, then bottom 10% percentile of the consumption on electricity
 would be considered non-visible and anything above that level would be
 considered visible).
 The plots of log-expenditures are shown with rising 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (starting with the lowest percentile 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to lowest non-zero log-level of consumption of the commodity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
For a good that is not positional, one expects that the consumers from lower
 and higher quantiles of total expenditure (x-axis) would consume similar
 amounts of the good (y-axis).
 For a positional good, the consumers spending higher expenditure on the
 good would lean towards consumers with higher total expenditure.
 This does not indicate signaling in any way - but tests only whether a
 commodity is consumed uniformly amongst those with lower and higher total
 expenditure outlays (this is rather a measure of scarcity of the item than
 of its visibility).
 Choosing different thresholds (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta)$
\end_inset

 provides a a control on the degree to which a certain commodity can be
 included in our conspicuous consumption basket.
 Instead of asking whether marriage spending is visible or not - for example
 - the test asks if only the richer consumers can afford a significant expenditu
re on marriage (while varying the degree of visibility attached to spending
 on marriage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In the data from Tanzania, while top 56% of consumers show spending on rice,
 electricity appears to be a luxury when only top 22 % of consumers spend
 on it.
 This does not necessitate that a higher consumption of electricity indicates
 higher status but a higher threshold for electricity certainly indicates
 its physical scarcity which may permit status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Not all scarce objects can be indicative of status - we often need some
 judgment to decide which products may indicate status signaling.
 A survey accomplishes this by ranking all products as viewed by its respondents.
 It must also be noted that visibility or positional signaling of a commodity
 is hardly orthogonal to major expenditure categories.
 The usual arguments of additive utilities cannot hold for conspicuous consumpti
on.
 In other words, if walnut turns out to be of visible significance (ranked
 high in the consumers' perception of visibility in the survey) then one
 can no longer talk about the combined utility of food and visible items
 (walnut is both a food item and a visible good)

Detailed microdata thus becomes a necessity for discussing income elasticities
 of visible items (

A similar analysis of Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) data from years
 2004,2010 and 2014 similarly shows clear differences between expenditure
 on jewelry and fruits.
 It is evident that jewelry is not popular amidst the relatively poor and
 that richer consumers spend a higher portion of their total expenditure
 on jewelry than on fruits (curve being steeper for jewelry).

Consumer Appeal and Utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In an 
\begin_inset Formula $n-$
\end_inset

commodity world, the elasticities of demand can explain the relative preference
 of items.
 If a utility function for every individual is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $u=f(q_{1},q_{2}...q_{n};p_{1},p_{2}...p_{n})$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 commodities in the consumer universe where quantities consumed are denoted
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 and prices as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

, then every consumer is said maximize her utility by choosing quantities
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1},q_{2}...q_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 With the assumption that every consumer is rational and adjusts the quantities
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1},q_{2},q_{3}...q_{n}$
\end_inset

 to optimize the utility function, we fit the utility function given fixed
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1i},q_{2i}...$
\end_inset

 values for every consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 The parameters of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 that optimize the set of data are thus inferred from the consumption data.
 A model that considers the visual and positional appeal of every item,
 would require the utility function to include the parameters related to
 positional and visual appeal of the item.
 The interpretation of Slutsky equation which is derived 
\begin_inset Formula $dq=\frac{\partial q}{\partial p}dp+\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}dx$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{n}q=x)$
\end_inset

 would also need to change in consideration of the parameters related to
 positional consumption.
 Some of these parameters are considered in the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:AppealsRanking"

\end_inset

.
 To separate the price and budget concerns in the conventional utility function
 from these suggested parameters related to positional consumption, we delineate
 all the price and budget concerns under affordability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

To demonstrate how price and budget concerns are addressed in a discussion
 of utility curves, we can consider a two-good world comprising of food
 and education.
 If we choose a Cobb-Douglas function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x,y)=Ax^{\alpha}y^{1-\alpha}$
\end_inset

(where 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y$
\end_inset

 are food and education quantities respectively)

, then we can calibrate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\alpha_{0}$
\end_inset

 for a vector of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 In the Cobb-Douglas utility, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 measures whether consumption is complementary (high 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

) or  necessary (low 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha)$
\end_inset

.
 The shape of the curve (marginal propensity to consume) can tell us which
 product is preferred more over the other.
 The total expenditure elasticities of demand similarly provide an estimate
 of the preference between education and food
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Strictly speaking we cannot use total expense elasticity since we should
 consider the cost of education in the area to calculate education unit
 consumed and calculate food units consumed based on the food price in the
 survey.
 A multiple regression approach - which can easily include region, education
 or other factors affecting consumer preferences - is often preferred over
 an analysis based on utility curves.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is easy to see from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:EducationvsFood"

\end_inset

 for the LSMS data from Tanzania, that most consumers would rather spend
 on food than on education.
 For multiple items, we would rely on the elasticities of demand to understand
 the relative preferences of the consumer.
 A model for positional consumption needs to be be developed to enhance
 the utility function so that elasticities of demand with respect to parameters
 pertinent to positional consumption can be interpreted similarly.

The non-parametric methods specified by Afriat and Varian take a different
 path by not assuming the nature of the utility function (Cobb-Douglas,

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 These may be more relevant for the fitting of utility function.
 Afriat's utilities consider prices and quantities that sum up to the total
 expenditure.
 Even though we don't have the price-data available from the survey, an
 approach similar to Afriat equations has the advantage that it provides
 a utility function that is consistent with data (unlike a parametric method).
 This is planned to be explored later in the study.

Combining the parameters into a ranking of Items
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hierarchical way of combining all three might provide a way to assess the
 combined status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
If the four parameters where strictly binary (i.e.
 if an item was available or not, affordable or not, popular or not and
 was bandwagon or snob), then order of appeals would be as shown in the
 table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:AppealRanking"

\end_inset

 - with appeals ranked from low to high for every tuple of the 4 four parameters
 (16 in total).
 An available, affordable and popular bandwagon would have a higher appeal
 than an unavailable, unaffordable and and unpopular bandwagon item and
 so on.
 Notice that popular bandwagon and unpopular snob type items are given the
 same rank if availability and affordability is the same for them.
 Another key feature of the ranking is that availability and affordability
 make a snob item less interesting while they both increase the appeal of
 the bandwagon item.
 If we were to map the appeal from these four parameters in a linear function
 it may look something like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\pi & =k_{\alpha}\alpha+k_{\aleph}\aleph+k_{b}b+k_{\rho}\rho+k_{b\rho}b\rho+\nu
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 where
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\epsilon\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\aleph\le1$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $0\le b\le1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\rho\le1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=availability$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula $\aleph=affordability$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula $b=bandwagon\ propensity$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula $\rho=popularity$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=appeal$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
An easier formulation of the linear function can be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $-(1-b)\rho(\alpha+mb\aleph)+b(1-\rho)(\alpha+mb\aleph)+b\rho(\alpha+mb\aleph+\kappa)+(1-b)(1-\rho)(\alpha+mb\aleph+\kappa)=K_{1}+\kappa K_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In the decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}+\kappa K_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}$
\end_inset

 represents the appeal for misaligned items (unpopular bandwagon and popular
 snob) while 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2}$
\end_inset

 represents the aligned items (popular bandwagon and unpopular snob).
 Appeal of a bandwagon item is only affected by a constant factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa b\rho$
\end_inset

 in addition to the purchase concern: 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha+mb\aleph$
\end_inset

.
 If an item is a snob item then popularity switches the sign of appeal from
 negative 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho=1)$
\end_inset

 to positive 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho=0)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

A simpler form of the above equation currently used in study is written
 as :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
B & =\frac{(1-b)(1-\rho)}{(1+\delta-\alpha)(1+2\delta-\aleph)}+\frac{(1-b)\rho}{(1-2\delta+\alpha)(1-\delta+\aleph)}+\frac{b(1-\rho)}{(1+2\delta-\alpha)(1+\delta-\aleph)}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\sigma & =(1-b)\rho+2b(1-\rho)+\kappa(b\rho+2(1-b)(1-\rho))

.
 While the visibility surveys (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

) attempt to study how consumption on certain commodities may signal status,
 the goal of the proposed game is to characterise environments under which
 the perceptions of a higher-status may develop.
 The game attempts to emulate i) the consumer market and ii) the mechanism
 through which status may be assigned within a group of consumers.
 It therefore relies on participants playing the dual role of a consumer
 and status-observer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The activities of purchasing and assigning status are separate in the game.
 Since a simulated purchase performed by the participants in the game (given
 a list of commodities, prices and outlay) is quite likely to deviate from
 their real world purchases and their real needs, the participants are instead
 asked what additional items they would purchase for a given a basket of
 commodities that they already possess (using a cumulative voting scheme
 that emulates selection of commodities in a market - see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Purchasing_Mechanism"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The second part of the game emulates status assignment - where participants
 assign a score of status and effectiveness each to 3 (or more) other participan
ts in the game by looking at the quantities of the item categories possessed
 and purchased by the latter.
 The judgment of status in the real world does not involve direct observance
 of prices and thus it is only the quantity of the identified items consumed
 or already possessed that matters in the status-assignment part of the
 game.
 The end-goal of the game is to purchase a basket most desired by others
 - the winner achieves this goal by purchasing commodities of her choice
 that are most desirable by everyone and are indicative of a rank higher
 than everyone else in the game.

 in a way that truly represents their needs.
 Hence, instead of asking the respondent how they'll spend the given outlay

 spend the additional 100 dollars for a given 1000 dollars of outlay (or
 more) value of items that they already have stocked up.
 The

 While the

 is made of non-positional items, the participants choose 3 items from a
 mix of non-positional items and positional items - given the 10% extra
 outlay.
 Since all participants cannot be assumed to be equally numerate, the game
 uses a scheme similar to cumulative voting - where 10 virtual coins are
 provided to the participant and the participant is asked to distribute
 the coins amongst a set of available items (both positional and non-positional).
 The provided outlay in the game (number of coins) may vary for participants
 - in proportion to the income distribution that is observed in the relevant
 consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS for Tanzania).

 basket (i.e.
 all baskets have the same set of categories).

Constraints and Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The game attempts to measure status and consumption with respect to high
 asset ownership, social class or familial responsibility.
 Since players choose between physical needs and positional needs in the
 game, a different circumstance is likely to affect their choice and hence
 their perceived status.
 The game presents a precondition to the player - indicating high asset
 ownership, a chosen social class or a familial liability.
 For example, to test a participant's choice between food and electricity,
 the game can present a large family as a constraint, and record the choice
 between spending more on food vs installing electricity.
 The game thus measures indirect effects of reward or constraints on status
 by allowing participants to gauge the suitability of a participant's choice
 in the status game in the presence of constraints (familial) or rewards
 (asset-related).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Notice that the constraint variable is only planned to be binary in the
 current scheme i.e.
 it is either a reward or a liability (when present).
 The two values are expected to have an opposite affect on the purchase
 of new items.
 Admittedly, the binary values of constraints vs rewards circumvent the
 difficulty in comparisons between disparate needs of the consumers - e.g.
 a large family, senior member or a social event (e.g.
 marriage/funeral).
 While a multi-valued variable (if adopted) can potentially provide better
 insights into the relative effects of these several types constraints,
 the goal of the current exercise is to test for a direct effect of constraints
 on status (rather than relative effect of the various possible constraints).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\paragraph_spacing single
Status ranking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The status-ranking activity involves a student assigning a status score
 by looking at i) what the other participant with a given income level does
 with the extra outlay and ii) what the participant already possesses.
 In the ranking scheme, the participants provide a score on effectiveness
 as well as status to all the other (3 or more) participants observed.
 Notice that in presence of constraints specified in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

, regardless of whether one is selfish or not, a participant would tend
 to penalise someone else who she thinks is going to be more selfish than
 herself.
 Since the game provides a way to penalize selfishness by status ranks,
 the participants are discouraged from indicating status through overspending
 on positional items.
 The penalty for not caring for a sick parent may be huge in the society
 but so can be the penalty for being stingy.
 Similarly, while some may want to indicate wealth by buying a watch they
 may also fear disrespect for not taking care of a sick family member.
 The scores on effectiveness and status are thus not only a way to discourage
 the consumer from limiting the unrealistic purchases in the simulated purchasin
g part of the game, they also track the effect of the externalities such
 as sickness or age (measured through the binary variable discussed in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
While consumers try to maximise their utility by purchasing more items for
 a given limited outlay - they also manage their prestige by letting others
 have a better opinion of themselves.
 The status game can thus be seen as an enhanced version of the survey that
 asks people to imagine a neighbour who spends more than them on a chosen
 commodity (used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

).
 The proposed game attempts to measure how consumers might act given a certain
 circumstances while both status and welfare (effectiveness score can be
 seen as a proxy of concern for others) become part of the payoff function
 in the game.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\paragraph_spacing single
Welfare and Status competitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The solution of this game for a set of rational players remains a pending
 exercise in this study.
 The key motivation for the analysis at this point is that fundamentally
 all social welfare concerns are concerns of Pareto optimality.
 Moreover, the payoff function for effectiveness in the game is meant to
 be a proxy for welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
With Pareto optimality in mind, more spending on education, health seems
 desirable - but it may be become distant for consumers due to their immediate
 needs - whether positional or non-positional.
 A comparison with what is observed in consumption data versus what is observed
 about positional consumption in games can provide some insight into the
 social status that can influence the desired welfare equilibrium.

Policy implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The discussion so far leans towards permitting status competitions rather
 than attempting to tax or control them.
 This is in line with the suggestions offered by Robert H Frank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 favouring a non-monetary market of statuses only so that status games (which
 are a necessity) do not overlap with the market for real goods.
 Due to structural reasons of the modern economy, advertising efforts can
 turn a social scarcity into a physical scarcity (to use the Hirsch's terminolog
y
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"

\end_inset

).
 A profit-driven industry and the advertising pursued by the companies tend
 to increase the status competition for a commodity.
 Instead of letting status competitions modify the distribution of that
 physical goods through competition (and thus do little to avoid the problem
 of physical scarcities in the developing countries), policy can attempt
 to provide status-games in a world of non-necessity items - in some ways
 to diffuse the status competitions in the society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In poor and non-pecuniary societies, the desire to become rich or the benefit
 of inheriting money and education is often less reachable.
 Status and money translate into social securities in unstructured societies.
 These may well be detected in the countries in Africa - but limited data
 on household characteristics in Tanzania (related to ethnicity or religion)
 have prevented us from such an analysis for Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The question that we seek the answer for in the context of Tanzania (or
 another developing country) is whether the expenditure on high-status or
 scarce items (an analysis similar to one conducted by Prais Houthakker
 for expensive and cheap tea varieties amongst social classes in the UK
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerFamilySurvey"

\end_inset

) - is actually more desirable than on housing and education.
 The designed experiment intends to find answer to this question.
 If the answer is indeed the former, then it makes sense to limit the status
 competitions through policy to support status competitions on non-essential
 items (possibly by introducing brand differentiation).
 Attaching glamour to education, healthcare and food items may help consumers
 prioritize their needs.
