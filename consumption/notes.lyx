\begin_layout Title
Conspicuous consumption in the sub-Saharan Africa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Status competitions amongst workers often explain the income distribution
 better than the permanent income or productivity models.
 The current study looks for instances of status competitions within communities
 in developing countries, focusing on sub-Saharan African countries where
 recent large-scale urban migrations and proliferation of industrial products
 have occurred after social upheavals.
 The goal of this study to understand the changes in status competitions
 in response to proliferation of industrial products, changing family characteri
stics, regional effects and social interaction levels.
 The study also attempts to establish a general criterion for positional
 consumption and seeks methods to measure positional value of an item an
 environment of advertising and marketing.
 A key claim of the study is that physical scarcity in the developing countries
 does not rule out social scarcities and that the status competitions and
 positional consumption must be considered for a better understanding of
 urban migration patterns and consumption pressures.

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism is inherent in all exchange of goods and services (including

Many studies related to conspicuous consumption have relied on a visibility
 survey - which quantifies the lot of complex interactions in what may constitut
e status competitions in a society.
 A luxury item - for example - needs to be marketed as a luxury for it to
 both impart visible signals to others and to improve self-perception of
 the buyer.
 In Veblen's original framework, for a product to indicate status it must
 be rare and superfluous (thus serve as an exploit).
 That a watch is more noticeable than an insurance policy (and associated
 with higher income) is not entirely relevant to this framework.
 Moreover, whether a poor person buying a cheap watch and a richer person
 buying an expensive watch (probably subject to import restrictions) are
 both instances of conspicuous consumption or not depends on the context
 that the observer chooses.
 Cheap watches may or may not constitute conspicuous consumption - depending
 on the social welfare function.
 The wide variety of criteria in conspicuous consumption seem to indicate
 this ambiguity (See Table

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In both the developed and developing worlds, conspicuous consumption is
 driven by perceived scarcity and competition (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "HirschSocialLimits,FrankPond"

\end_inset

).
 If status were imparted by inherited wealth alone, there would be little
 conspicuous consumption as the consumers would be quick to realise the
 futility of buying trinkets.
 In the developed world, where markets have evolved to address the demands
 of the population, the positional pressures are readily addressed by market
 forces - thus a preference for visible goods indicates a higher price on
 them and a higher consumption on visible products always 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a higher status (a product with a higher status symbol would automatically
 carry a higher price).
 In underdeveloped markets, where information asymmetries are abound, the
 higher signalling (for conspicuous consumption) would not necessarily be
 achieved with higher spending on visible goods - and other factors (e.g.
 social standing, asset ownership, social networks and education) start
 to matter in the combined utility function - as is suggested by data from
 various cross-section expenditure surveys.
 These other mechanisms of signaling - although not part of purchases -
 fall under Veblen's view of conspicuous consumption.

Scarcity - A term used by Fred Hirsch in a theory to explain distribution
 of resources in a society.
 Scarcity is the perceived or real lack of products or services created
 by a competition for them which is intensified by population growth ( through
 increased productivity and time costs).
 Scarcities can be either direct or indirect and thus - physical or social.
 Hirsch also points out that social scarcities are becoming physical scarcities
 (so this distinction isn't so clear after all).

\begin_layout Description

Congestion - The competition for resources in the context of modern Western
 society where physical scarcities (severe shortages of food and shelter)
 have been largely conquered.
 In Hirsch's theory, congestion is a side-effect of commercialization and
 removal of older social barriers.
 Since all goods and amenities are available through money, the competition
 and scarcity for what used to be accessible to only the top few have intensifie
d.
 With economic progress therefore, consumers are more - not less - driven
 by status needs than before.

 It encompasses not just goods available for purchase in the market (that

 Veblen's was a rather unconventional attempt to link the social barriers

A robber baron, Veblen says, has a better chance of escaping the law than
 a small crook because “a well-bred expenditure of his booty especially
 appeals to persons of a cultivated sense of the proprieties and goes far
 to mitigate the sense of moral turpitude with which his dereliction is
 viewed by them.” Scholars do not ordinarily associate the disposal of ill-gotten
 wealth with good breeding (quoted from Galbraith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GalbraithEssential"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Veblen's focus had been the consumption patterns of the richer section
 of society and the way conspicuous consumption is understood is through
 to inference of status through continued search for expensive or rare items.
 Veblen provides a psychological framework to explain the competitions that
 have survived since barbaric times when insignia were used to indicate
 status.
 Status indication - as is noted in the study in the context of developing
 countries - can extend beyond the purchase of items in the market.

 Developments of the last century in Africa and Asia bear similarity to
 this phenomenon where a new working class has clashed with feudal and colonial
 systems of the century before.
 The growing status competitions amongst the nascent working classes have
 been a subject of sociological study in the late 20th century.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, this competition was termed as Sanskritizat

 acquired economic freedoms

It would be inaccurate though to draw wide-ranging conclusions based on
 economic poverty.
 The administrative successes and stabilities of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before.
 The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires,
 for example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries
 when compared to the administrative units (much as the political boundaries
 themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.

Despite regional differences, the political landscape of Asian and African
 economies is dominated by effects of decolonization - a process that encompasse
s the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia and Africa aspiring
 to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 - often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike - their limited reach and success has prevented the freedom of status
 competitions.
 It is difficult to observe whether countries undergoing military conflict
 have higher measures of status competitions but there is little doubt that
 government-driven resettlements and urban movements of the 20th century
 can have an impact on identities and the pace of industrialisation (both
 of which affect status-related consumption).
 The state of urban development that most developing countries are in, the
 status competitions that may have otherwise been limited to tribal or local
 levels can now find expressions in urban settings

Competitions for Social mobility

As far as market principles can work, status and mobility have a key role
 to play in economic development.
 The core of Adam Smith's arguments is that economic progress can be achieved
 by letting an exchange between the rich and poor thrive.
 In the world Adam Smith lived, trinkets could be turned into bread
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 From this point of view, more spending on a conspicuous item would benefit
 the society as a whole - since the money obtained from the rich on the
 item could potentially fund employment and other opportunities.
 Electricity would for example be a model item for this purpose in Africa
 - an item whose consumption can drive the expansion of power plants and
 make electricity cheaper.
 More spending on signaling goods does not appear to be a social waste from
 this perspective.
 However, not all marketable goods are as desirable as electricity and there
 may be goals more desirable than what the said exchange can provide.
 Unlike in the Western world - where the differences between the rich and
 poor have already been reduced to a level that this exchange could not
 be made lucrative to the poor any more

\end_layout

\end_inset

 - the basic needs for the masses haven't been addressed in the developing
 world.
 While one should expect the exchange between rich and poor to draw the
 masses out of poverty in Africa, there are limits to such success in the
 developing countries.
 The essential goods often lack a market in the developing countries and
 since marketable goods often create needs on their own, the development
 of market for conspicuous goods may prevent the status competitions from
 achieving the goals of social welfare.
 The way societies are structured, anything available to the richer sections
 of the society can easily become a status good and thus the possibility
 of a social waste due to spending on status goods cannot be ruled out in
 the developing countries either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
These limitations of status competitions are largely because of weak institution
s in the developing countries - which have followed their own paths to economic
 development while achieving goals of nationalism.
 The developing countries now face the problem of institutions not being
 strong enough to establish the exchange between the rich and the poor or
 to let it thrive.
 In the new urban settings in Africa, both tribal identities and the hierarchies
 formed through education, money or industrial assets now contribute to
 status competitions.
 While this development can encourage institutions of money and education
\begin_inset Foot

 limit themselves to markets not developed enough to undertake severe scarcities.

The relationship between education, urban developments, income levels and
 tribal identities is difficult to assess without access to the microdata
 on tribal identities and regional migration.
 In absence of this data (as is the case with LSMS used in the study), we
 can consider other proxies that may be correlated with social identities
 (e.g.
 family income levels, language spoken, locality etc.

 Still, the measurement error for variables in any claimed relationship
 between identity and purchasing power in Africa can be severe - due to
 i) a bulky informal sector (which may have expanded due to recent economic
 developments), ii) expansions in the areas of micro-credit as well as mass
 education

 in Tanzania).

Ultimately, wealth is the strongest indicator of status.
 Status related consumption exists because i) wealth is often not directly
 visible and ii) those in the middle-rank of wealth might want to indicate
 more status than is indicated by their real wealth.
 This makes status goods universally relevant for consumption.

Supply of an item

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In simple terms, a signaling product indicates the buyer's status to the
 immediate surroundings.
 Status being a sociological phenomenon, it is non-trivial to classify a
 good as a signaling good.
 If for example, only the rich could afford electricity in a society, electricit
y may not appear as a signaling product for most of the population.
 From the point of view of consumption, a good being used by a smaller and
 richer part of the population has less significance than a good used by
 the majority of the population.
 Items consumed by more people may carry more significance in deciding whether
 a good is a status good or not
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A regression with quantities consumed as dependent variable would bear more
 significance for items consumed by more people.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - however, one must also consider the supply of the item and the permanent
 income of the consumer before declaring an item more status bearing than
 the other.
 When an item is in limited supply, only those consumers with higher purchasing
 power (or those who must pass some other barrier) would have access to
 it.
 For example, if electricity is not available throughout the country, then
 only those with higeher income or with residence in certain areas (where
 there is electricity) can have their signaling needs fulfilled with the
 item.
 Hence, when expenditure on the item is limited to the richer sections of
 society, then the item is a status good merely through being a statement
 of wealth

.
 Therefore, electricity would be considered a status item in our study -
 simply because its low supply indicates richness explicitly.
 Another consequence of this observation is that the supply of an item can
 be used in a selection equation to reduce the bias in the zero consumption
 of an item (such as electricity).

Bandwagon effect

Other than the price of the item in the market or other barriers to distribution
 of the desired item, what characterises a typical status improving commodity
 is the tendency of the consumers to flock towards the item.
 The demand for a status item is enhanced by the popularity of the item.
 Newly introduced goods thus often create a market of their own - a mechanism
 often accentuated by the advertising effects.
 This

As a crude way to detect this tendency to flock towards an item (i.e.
 the bandwagon effect), we rely on time-series change of the budget share
 (analysis of elasticities) of the item to see how sensitive the budget
 share of the item is to time, income and supply.
 The equilibrium consumption values can shift when a higher supply is provided
 (more electrical power plants or cheaper alternative energy would reduce
 the budget share on electricity).
 If the budget share of electricity increases then we may conclude that
 people may be flocking to the commodity (after accounting for considering
 income effects)

This method of classification can provide some (not all) candidates for
 status goods - but as long as everybody wants higher status it can be argued
 that all status goods would exhibit a change in budget share with respect
 to supply (a snob item - where more abundance causes disinterest would
 report a decrease in budget share - thus for items that are available only
 to the rich are likely to become snob items)

 A flight to urban areas is not only an escape from the despondent circumstances
 but also a chance for improbable social mobilities.
 Yet the opportunities of income and social mobility are not all that are
 offered by the migration to urban areas - there is also the availability
 of the range of products that are entirely absent from the agrarian rural
 settings.
 A model cognisant of the demand for these items may enhance the model based
 on the expected income payoff from migration (where the payoff itself is
 often not known nor assessed by the migrant).

Measuring Status Competition in a Developing Economy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
To measure positional consumption one can either split the consumer basket
 into positional and non-positional items or assign a positional parameter
 (visibility etc.) to every commodity in the basket.
 In this study, the criterion of classification (or assignment of such a
 parameter to every item) is inspired by Hirsch's notion of congestion -
 a herding of consumers to the desired commodity that causes physical or
 social scarcities.
 The difference between physical and social scarcities is not considered
 relevant (a clarification on the notion of scarcity is provided in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:FS"

\end_inset

).
 The simplest criterion employed in classification of items is the difference
 in prices (wherever available) of the same item.
 For items that are physical scarce, the price differences between commodities
 is less likely (although still possible due to distribution and storage
 costs involved).
 On the other hand, every product where price differences exist is a potential
 signaling product that can create congestion.
 As a positional product can create a market of its own, the marginal effect
 on demand of a new product of over time can provide a further test for
 signaling capability.

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.

A survey quantifies a lot of complex interactions in what constitutes status
 competitions in a society.
 A luxury item - for example - needs to be marketed as a luxury for it to
 both impart visible signals to others and to improve self-perception of
 the buyer.
 In Veblen's original framework, for a product to indicate status it must
 be rare and superfluous (thus serve as an exploit).
 That a watch is more noticeable than an insurance policy (and associated
 with higher income) is not entirely relevant to this framework.
 Moreover, whether a poor person buying a cheap watch and a richer person
 buying a watch that is far more expensive (and probably subject to import
 restrictions) are both instances of conspicuous consumption or not depends
 on the context that the observer chooses.
 Cheap watches may or may not constitute conspicuous consumption - depending
 on the social welfare function.
 The wide variety of criteria in conspicuous consumption seem to indicate
 this ambiguity (See Table

 If status were imparted by inherited wealth alone, there would be little

 In the developed world, where markets have evolved to address the demands

 forces - thus a preference for visible goods indicates a higher price on
 them and a higher consumption on visible products always

 In underdeveloped markets, where information asymmetries are abound, the

 be achieved with higher spending on visible goods - and other factors start
 to matter in the combined utility function - as is suggested by data from

The need for a survey to measure visibility of items in the basket is however

Khamis et al

 ask two key questions to respondents in an online survey conducted in India.
 First asked them how closely they needed to interact with their neighbour
 (with similar demographic characteristics) in order to observe above average
 spending for a list of items (Options were -‘1: No Interaction’, ‘2: Occasional
 Interaction’, ‘3: Friend’, ‘4: Close Friend’ or ‘5: No matter how much
 one Interacts’).
 An item where >20% respondents report 1 or 2 was considered a visible item.
 A second question asked them what they'll expect of the consumption of
 an item after a sudden 20 percent rise in their neighbor's income ‘1: Fall’,
 ‘2: Stay the same’, ‘3: Increase by less than 20 percent’, ‘4: Increase
 by 20 percent’ or ‘5: Increase by more than 20 percent’.
 The list of items in these questions attempted to match the consumption
 categories in the IHDS.
 An item is associated with higher income if more than 20% of respondents
 reported 2,3,4 or 5.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Visibility is a socio-cultural judgment - and the visibility basket from
 the developed world cannot be translated as such into disparate geographies
 and cultural environments of the developing world.
 One can arrive at wrong conclusions on visible consumption for a consumer
 group if a visibility basket was chosen from a different cultural environment.
 For example, hair-products may be associated with a higher visibility (and
 promise) in the developed world but in the developing world their purpose
 could be just utilitarian (poor quality of production, cultural factors
 etc.).
 Attributing lower visible consumption based on a low consumption of hair-produc
ts would thus be erroneous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Another practical problem arises in the developing world because of the
 predominant use of recall method in expenditure survey.
 A relevant anomaly is the Deaton Paxson paradox(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonPaxsonParadox"

\end_inset

) - i.e.
 the observed decrease in food expenditure per head as household size rises
 (with constant outlay per head).
 The likely cause for the paradox is presence of errors correlated with
 household size in the data that results in possible overestimation of the
 consumption of recalled items
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonDeatonPaxson"

\end_inset

.
 Caution must therefore be taken (or a correction applied) when mixing expenditu
res from recall and diary methods.
\end_layout

While the visibility elasticities may not be compared across countries without
 above considerations but a comparison within the country can provide insights
 into the effect of certain demographic factors on visible consumption.
 This has been the central theme for most of the studies surveyed in this
 note.
 More than to improve the measurement of visibility, the studies are interested
 in identifying the demographic parameters that explain the log-expenditure
 of visibility basket as is.
 The general regression equation for such a study is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (accumulated over the chosen visibility basket), 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure.
 Households with higher total expenditure are far more likely to be those
 with higher visible expenditure.
 Thus, total expenditure (on the right side of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lnvis_regression"

\end_inset

) makes it an endogenous variable for the dependent variable : 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(vis_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 A different approach is taken by Jaikumar et al who use weights in the
 basket rather than visible expenditure levels - so that visible expenditure
 is not subject to the endogeneity problem that arises due to total expenditure
 being on the right hand side and visible expenditure on left hand side
 of the equation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"

\end_inset

 (The proportion of visible expenditure with respect to the total expenditure
 could be the same for those with higher total expenditure and lower total
 expenditure).
 However, since data on income is often poor or sparse in the developing
 countries, total expenditure turns out to be the most frequent choice for
 a proxy of permanent income (
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a key control parameter for the analysis of visible consumption).
 In most of the studies, the said endogeneity of total expenditure is resolved
 by a choice of appropriate instruments - e.g.
 income, cubic-income, positive-income dummies or occupation codes.
 These instruments identified by Charles et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

 are reported to be quite strong in the studies surveyed as part of this
 note (Sargan and Wu-Hausman tests confirm endogeneity and the effectiveness
 of chosen instruments).

 (with black-dummy and coloured-dummy), the coefficients for coloured and
 black are negative (i.e.
 black and coloured social groups spend less on visible consumption than
 the white population).
 However, these coefficients flip signs after adding income controls(II)

 The endogeneity of total expenditure requires instrumentation - Kaus uses
 instruments suggested by Charles, Roussanov and Hurst - including positive-inco
me-dummy, cube-of-income-level, dummies for under-secondary-education, secondary
-education and degree-education.
 Kaus then performs two 2SLS regressions - one with income controls and
 total-expenditure as control variables

The first-change of sign when income controls are added implies that after
 accounting for income of household head, the coloured and black groups
 spend more on visible consumption.
 Total expenditure is not a perfect proxy of permanent income - which justifies
 instrumentation.
 After resolving these endogeneity concerns - with a regression of visible
 expenditure as dependent variable and total-expenditure as one of the control
 variables - the signs are revised - although 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 does not change a lot.
 Adding demographic controls to the 2SLS regression - shows significance
 of age, urban/rural area and family size - but coefficients are still not
 lowered significantly.
 This confirms that coloured and black social groups spend a rather disproportio
nate amount on visible consumption.
 Kaus paper is interested in testing whether the rise in average group income
 reduces the visible consumption.
 The regression considers average-incomes of particular provinces for every
 group (black/white/coloured).
 This regression shows the effect more on black-social-group than the white-soci
al-group - a difference that author argues points out alternate ways of
 signaling for white-social-group relative to black-social-group.

 If that criterion is relaxed (i.e.
 if anyone reporting the horref1 variable is considered hispanic for the
 study) the number of Hispanics in the survey almost doubles.

 (with black-dummy and hispanic-dummy), the coefficients for coloured and

 the white population).

Tanzania has been the first country to be analysed in the study.
 With recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, the country
 provides a much desired snapshot of the consumer world of developing sub-Sahara
n Africa.
 The data chosen for the preliminary analysis is from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) conducted by the World Bank.
 LSMS includes expenditure microdata from about 10,000 households - with
 many of the expenditure categories of potential visible value.
 With no verifiable measure of visibility, all expenditure not related to
 food and utilities is evaluated for potentially visibility.
 These chosen categories from LSMS are listed in Table

\begin_layout Standard

The income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If there are

 sources of income each, then it is safe to assume that workers in the same
 region and same employment-type have reasonably similar incomes.
 The variance in incomes recorded for the same local group can give an estimate
 of how noisy the data is due to self-reporting.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Techniques for Panel data analysis can be used on a population that is observed
 for a sufficiently long time to provide effects of changing incomes, price
 variations on the consumer preferences.
 A significant degree of demand analysis from panel data comes out of the
 Slutsky equation approach (e.g.
 the well-known AIDS model - a particular version of the Rotterdam model).
 With no time-series data, on the other hand, one relies on price-variations
 within the cross-section and interpretations of commodity-elasticities
 (instead of effects of changing income on a monitored household).
 A few commonly adopted techniques are discussed below.

Engel Curves

\begin_layout Standard

Houthakker attributes the suitability of Engel curves to the idea of equivalence
 scales (i.e.
 how different households achieve same level of living standard).
 Although Houthakker's Engel fitting would now be considered unashamedly
 pragmatic [sic] 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, his research was influential in popularising the use of income and expenditure
 elasticities in cross-sectional analyses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The simplest Engel curves are set up with the Woking-Leser model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$
\end_inset

 are regression coefficients.
 A noticeable shortcoming with the Woking-Leser model is that no commodity
 specific information is used in the semi-logarithmic equation.
 The current study attempts to enhance this model with household and geographic
 parameters.

 (
\begin_inset Formula $R$

 is a finite set and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{r}(\cdot)$

 are general functions).
 For these to be consistent, one arrives at the cost function: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\ ln\ c(u,p)}{\partial\ ln\ p_{i}}=\sum_{r\epsilon R}a_{ir}(p)\Phi_{r}\{ln\ c(u,p)\}$

Heffetz finds that the degree to which people notice items explains the
 corresponding (permanent) income elasticities better.
 This observation has provided the basis for inspection of visible consumption
 in many studies thereforth.
 In an environment of inequalities, however, it is likely that the individuals
 with perceived higher status notice items differently from how the lower
 status individuals might notice them.
 The social factors thus relevant for the difference in visible preferences
 are sought in the studies on visible consumption in the developing countries.
 In India, this is found to be religion and caste - while in South Africa
 and United States, race seems to have a dominant significance.
 It is also worth noting that the developing countries may offer a less
 consumerist agrarian environment overall where expenditure is more visible
 than in a relatively individualistic and industrialized society.

In a developing economy, the criterion for conspicuous consumption is clearly
 not just noticeability any more.
 Visible consumption may detail the mechanics of status competitions in
 a narrow sense where consumers participate in a market to increase their
 perceived status - but it does not provide an adequate picture of conspicuous
 consumption.
 One reason is that markets are underdeveloped in the developing world and
 social status is largely yielded through economic classes and social conditions.
 The second - probably more significant - reason is that status signaling
 does not exist in a society as an inherent need for visible appeal amongst
 humans.
 Instead visible consumption matters because of an item being associated
 with a higher status (at least in the sense which Veblen had talked about
 in his 19th century treatise

A study of status and scarcity of items therefore goes hand in hand with
 the study of conspicuous consumption.
 Instead of limiting ourselves to visible consumption as the particular
 mechanics of status signaling - where consumers buy items in a common market
 and (presumably) over-weigh on items that are more noticeable - we attempt
 to understand the reasons behind status-signaling by looking at the differences
 in patterns between the richer and poorer sections of society and attempt
 to understand how unavailability of items (scarcity) as well as disparities
 of services across regions and classes in a society are reflected in both
 price and consumption of commodities.

The method with percentile thresholds briefly described in the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:precentile_threshold_method"

\end_inset

 is used to measure the degrees of scarcity on grounds of availability (electric
ity, food, education etc.) and affordability.
 If the item is affordable and not available, it should be considered as
 scarce.
 Severe scarcities would create minimal status competitions while under
 medium scarcity, status competition may thrive.
 For items that are not scarce at all (i.e.
 affordable by all and available to all) would not permit status competitions
 to develop.

The direct way of measuring visibility is to find an evidence of visibility
 in the commodities.
 Most studies have relied on their own visibility surveys.
 In absence of such a survey, one can verify commodities from public media
 - e.g.
 advertisements or social media traffic.
 These methods have not been pursued at this stage in the study.

Consumption percentiles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The differences between amounts spent by the lowest and higher percentile
 of spenders of a particular commodity are expected to be higher when a
 commodity is a status-good than when it is of common utility.
 The illustrations show non-zero log-level expenditure on a few commodities
 when the lower (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

) percentile of the consumption of the commodity is ignored.
 Ignoring the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile of the consumption of a visible commodity is equivalent to treating
 the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile expenditure as non-visible consumption (If we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=10\%$
\end_inset

 for electricity, then bottom 10% percentile of the consumption on electricity
 would be considered non-visible and anything above that level would be
 considered visible).
 The plots of log-expenditures are shown with rising 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (starting with the lowest percentile 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to lowest non-zero log-level of consumption of the commodity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
For a good that is not positional, one expects that the consumers from lower
 and higher quantiles of total expenditure (x-axis) would consume similar
 amounts of the good (y-axis).
 For a positional good, the consumers spending higher expenditure on the
 good would lean towards consumers with higher total expenditure.
 This does not indicate signaling in any way - but tests only whether a
 commodity is consumed uniformly amongst those with lower and higher total
 expenditure outlays (this is rather a measure of scarcity of the item than
 of its visibility).
 Choosing different thresholds (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta)$
\end_inset

 provides a a control on the degree to which a certain commodity can be
 included in our conspicuous consumption basket.
 Instead of asking whether marriage spending is visible or not - for example
 - the test asks if only the richer consumers can afford a significant expenditu
re on marriage (while varying the degree of visibility attached to spending
 on marriage).

In the data from Tanzania, while top 56% of consumers show spending on rice,
 electricity appears to be a luxury when only top 22 % of consumers spend
 on it.
 This does not necessitate that a higher consumption of electricity indicates
 higher status but a higher threshold for electricity certainly indicates
 its physical scarcity which may permit status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Not all scarce objects can be indicative of status - we often need some
 judgment to decide which products may indicate status signaling.
 A survey accomplishes this by ranking all products as viewed by its respondents.
 It must also be noted that visibility or positional signaling of a commodity
 is hardly orthogonal to major expenditure categories.
 The usual arguments of additive utilities cannot hold for conspicuous consumpti
on.
 In other words, if walnut turns out to be of visible significance (ranked
 high in the consumers' perception of visibility in the survey) then one
 can no longer talk about the combined utility of food and visible items
 (walnut is both a food item and a visible good)

In an 
\begin_inset Formula $n-$
\end_inset

commodity world, the elasticities of demand can explain the relative preference
 of items.
 If a utility function for every individual is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $u=f(q_{1},q_{2}...q_{n};p_{1},p_{2}...p_{n})$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 commodities in the consumer universe where quantities consumed are denoted
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 and prices as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

, then every consumer is said maximize her utility by choosing quantities
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1},q_{2}...q_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 With the assumption that every consumer is rational and adjusts the quantities
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1},q_{2},q_{3}...q_{n}$
\end_inset

 to optimize the utility function, we fit the utility function given fixed
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1i},q_{2i}...$
\end_inset

 values for every consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 The parameters of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 that optimize the set of data are thus inferred from the consumption data.
 A model that considers the visual and positional appeal of every item,
 would require the utility function to include the parameters related to
 positional and visual appeal of the item.
 The interpretation of Slutsky equation which is derived 
\begin_inset Formula $dq=\frac{\partial q}{\partial p}dp+\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}dx$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{n}q=x)$
\end_inset

 would also need to change in consideration of the parameters related to
 positional consumption.
 Some of these parameters are considered in the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 To separate the price and budget concerns in the conventional utility function
 from these suggested parameters related to positional consumption, we delineate
 all the price and budget concerns under affordability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

To demonstrate how price and budget concerns are addressed in a discussion
 of utility curves, we can consider a two-good world comprising of food
 and education.
 If we choose a Cobb-Douglas function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x,y)=Ax^{\alpha}y^{1-\alpha}$

\begin_inset Formula $x,y$

\end_inset

 for a vector of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$

 In the Cobb-Douglas utility, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 measures whether consumption is complementary (high 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

) or  necessary (low 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha)$
\end_inset

.
 The shape of the curve (marginal propensity to consume) can tell us which
 product is preferred more over the other.
 The total expenditure elasticities of demand similarly provide an estimate
 of the preference between education and food
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Strictly speaking we cannot use total expense elasticity since we should
 consider the cost of education in the area to calculate education unit
 consumed and calculate food units consumed based on the food price in the
 survey.
 A multiple regression approach - which can easily include region, education
 or other factors affecting consumer preferences - is often preferred over
 an analysis based on utility curves.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is easy to see from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:EducationvsFood"

\end_inset

 for the LSMS data from Tanzania, that most consumers would rather spend
 on food than on education.
 For multiple items, we would rely on the elasticities of demand to understand
 the relative preferences of the consumer.
 A model for positional consumption needs to be be developed to enhance
 the utility function so that elasticities of demand with respect to parameters
 pertinent to positional consumption can be interpreted similarly.

 Availability, Affordability, Popularity and the Bandwagon effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The challenge to a theory for conspicuous consumption is the difference
 between what people can buy (with the available options for a given price
 and budget in the market locally) and what they wish to buy instead (options
 that could change the current consumption when they become available).
 While the income elasticity for every item in the consumption category
 indicates how the consumption changes with response to increase in income
 or prices, the degree to which consumption on existing items would change
 by introduction of a new item or category (e.g.
 a new technology) is not explained by elasticities of demand of existing
 categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In analysis of a typical consumption survey, the substitution effect of
 the item explains whether consumers like an item more than the other while
 whether consumers buy more of the same item as they become richer and the
 price goes lower is captured by the income effect.
 While the analysis is typically based on the utility derived from products
 in the consumer basket, the research on conspicuous consumption has pointed
 out to relevance of visibility and scarcity of items in the utility function.
 To explore some such factors into the model for utility, the current study
 introduces four parameters to measure the consumer appeal of the item.
 The conventional price and budget concerns are encompassed by 
\series bold
affordability
\series default
 of the item (which is simply a statement of price of the item).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Since the elasticities of products interpreted from the consumption data
 cannot measure how consumption might be transformed if new items were introduce
d, we introduce a parameter to measure the availability of the item.
 This is based on the observation that consumption on the same item varies
 between regions that have another item available vs places where the item
 is completely unavailable.
 In developing countries, the issue of availability is particularly relevant
 since rural areas are faced with unavailability of services and goods that
 are available (although limited) in the urban areas
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The unavailability can spiral into severe demand pressures through pressures

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the data from Tanzania, not only are region dummies significant in consumpti
on of items in the survey (particularly with respect to such as electricity
 which is completely unavailable in large parts of the country), but the
 availability of electricity seems to transform the income elasticities
 of demand for other expenditures as well (e.g.
 marriage).
 A model that we wish to develop for appeal of an item attempts to include
 this difference in availability between regions.
 This is why 
\series bold
availability
\series default
 is introduced as a concern different from affordability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Given the unavailability of items like electricity in the developing world,
 the number of non-users of the item (those with zero quantity of consumption)
 can be quite high.
 To measure the appeal of an item, therefore we also consider how popular
 the item is among the consumers.
 The 
\series bold
popularity
\series default
 of item is derived from the percentiles of consumers.
 Higher popularity of the item (i.e.
 higher number of purchasers of the item in the population of consumers)
 can drive the appeal of the item down or up.
 Items like jewelry and luxury cars are those that cannot become extremely
 popular by definition.
 If such items were to become popular, then the richer consumers would rush
 to something else that indicates their higher status.
 Such items are known as snob items.
 Items which people rush to purchase - on the other hand - are called bandwagon
 items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
It is worth emphasizing that in a market where product differentiation exists,
 items can change from snob type to bandwagon type (or vice versa) over
 time.
 It is therefore important to have a dynamic model for bandwagon characteristics
 of an item.
 Items like new electronics are snob items when they're not affordable -
 but as they become more affordable with time they become bandwagon items.
 As consumers rush to them, they get replaced by a new snob item in the
 market.
  The effect of popularity of an item on to its demand can thus be in either
 direction i.e.
 low popularity can be associated with high demand (for a snob item) or
 high popularity can be associated with high demand (for a bandwagon item).
 In other words, for snob items, limited supply would mean a higher appeal
 but the high supply would mean less appeal.
 A time-series of expenditures can help us understand the trend in rushing
 towards certain items.
 The degree to which consumers rush to an item is termed as the 
\series bold
bandwagon effect 
\series default
in the study.
 The snob or bandwagon effects must be seen in combination with affordability
 and availability.
 If the item is available and not affordable - then the price and budget
 constraints dominate the bandwagon characteristics of the item.
 The snob or bandwagon nature of the item can reflect in demand only when
 it is affordable (thus potentially popular) as well as available - if the
 item is not affordable or not available then its appeal cannot be measured
 in the consumption surveys.
 This is in accordance with the discussion in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:FS"

\end_inset

 i.e.
 all direct physical scarcities are perceived scarcities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In summary, the appeal of a certain commodity is provided by its availability,
 affordability, popularity and bandwagon effect.
 Availability encompasses all issues that put an item in the market.
 Regional and supply-side issues thus affect availability.
 In absence of the data on supply of the items, we assign availability as
 a binary variable which is set to true in a region when the item appears
 in the consumption data for the region.
 Affordability, on the other hand, sums up price-related concerns on the
 demand-side.
 An item is affordable solely based on the price of the average consumption
 unit.
 Further, the popularity of an item is measured as percentile of users of
 item i.e.
 the percentile which consumes the quantity.
 Popularity of an item may increase or decrease the consumption of an item
 based on whether the item is a snob or bandwagon type.
 An individual is likely to lose interest in a particular jewelry product
 if it the latter is available and affordable to everybody.
 The effect of popularity on the appeal of the item is thus measured by
 another parameter called the bandwagon effect.
 Snob items are considered those with negative bandwagon effect in the study.
 In the Hirschian terminology

 social scarcities are realised through the rest of the three parameters.

\begin_layout Standard

For every individual an item is more affordable if its cost is within the
 threshold percentage of the (permanent) income.
 If consumers spend a high portion of their income on rice than on vegetables,
 then for the purposes of this study, rice is less affordable than fruits.
 One reason for choosing this simple method (instead of a regression of
 demand against household characteristics such as size and age of the consumers)
 is the unavailability of quantities of consumption in the diary recall
 section - where only total costs of the item have been collected (rather
 than prices or quantities).
 Semantically, affordability is a statement of price in the market and should
 be calculated from the average price of the item.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
For example, to answer whether AC is more affordable than electricity, we
 decide only based on average cost of AC in the population of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 consumers for item 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 amongst total  number of items 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}(\frac{q_{i}}{\Sigma^{K}q_{k}})$
\end_inset

 ).
 If average expenditure on AC amongst those who buy AC (i.e.
 the cost of AC) is higher than than the respective mean for electricity,
 then AC would be considered less affordable than electricity.
 That electricity is a service and consumed immediately (as opposed to AC
 which is an asset) is currently ignored in the model.
 The dependency amongst items is also ignored in the model.
 For example, one cannot have A.C.
 without having electricity - so even if A.C.
 is cheaper (more affordable) than electricity, a rational consumer wouldn't
 run to AC without having purchased electricity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
We also note that prices can be significantly different between regions.
 As discussed there are categories for which difference prices may exists
 within the same region.
 The way to incorporate this in the model would be to split the item category
 into multiple price band categories and treat each of the bands as different
 items - thus assigning them respective affordability values.

Appeal of items within the social-psychological communication is based on
 perceived differences between life standards and is thus relative to a
 reference area.
 At local levels this could be due to disparate neighborhoods while at national
 levels, reference areas could be metropolitan cities.
 The choice of reference area cannot be arbitrary - reference area is decided
 only between regions that are socially and economically inter-connected
 and thus where sufficient flow of information and people is possible.
 For the current analysis, Dar-es-salaam (region =7) is chosen as the reference
 area.
 The measure of popularity of an item is thus the reference area - i.e.
 the percentile of consumers using the product in the reference area.
 For example, only about 25% of the surveyed population uses electricity.
 Thus the popularity metric is set to .25 for electricity.

Measuring the Bandwagon effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Bandwagon effect is the measure of increase in appeal if the popularity
 in reference area were to increase (through increase in local availability).
 If we denote the popularity of an item in the reference area by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ref}$
\end_inset

, then the measure of the bandwagon effect is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial A}{\partial\rho_{ref}}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the change in appeal of the item in the reference area with respect to
 the change in the popularity of the item.
 Since appeal is represented by the demand of the item in the consumption
 survey, we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\rho_{ref}}=\frac{\partial A}{\partial\rho_{ref}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\frac{q}{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the quantity purchased, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the total expenditure, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the appeal and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ref}$
\end_inset

 is the item's popularity in the reference area.
 If items have become more popular over time and if consumers are on average
 spending a higher portion of their income on the item, then the bandwagon
 effect of the item would be considered strong.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Notice that the bandwagon effect 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is only calculated in the reference area.
 In the local area, the bandwagon effect must be calculated even if the
 item were not available i.e.
 the bandwagon effect 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is calculated even when the item is not locally available.
 In other words, we compute 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 for when the item is to become available.
 Calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\rho_{ref}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is interpreted as the tendency to flock i.e.
 changes in quantity demanded as the popularity of the item grows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
A better measure of the bandwagon effect 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 would be provided by observing the effect of popularity on demand over
 time (a term series).
 As a first-cut analysis, we approximate the change in quantity demanded
 in two randomly selected sub-samples with respect to the change in observed
 popularity (percentile of non-zero consumption).
 If slightly different quantiles of the society are spending more or less
 on the item then it may allow us to compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\gamma/\Delta\rho$
\end_inset

.
 More specifically, for two samples M and N, we look for 
\begin_inset Formula $(\gamma_{M}-\gamma_{N})/(\rho_{M}-\rho_{N})$
\end_inset

.
 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{M}-\gamma_{N}$
\end_inset

 represents the combined effect of differences in income, education level
 etc.
 between the two samples.
 A regression on the in-sampled data - 
\family typewriter
lm(expenditure/total_expenditure ~ consu + highest_educ + age + occupation_rank+
housingstatus
\family default
 - can thus provide a rough estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\rho}$
\end_inset

(notice that region - which cannot be ranked easily - is excluded from this
 equation - since we only consider the reference region for this regression)

To consider differences in categorical (dummy) variables - we use a transformati
on of every categorical variable into an ordered variable (education becomes
 education level, region becomes an order of urbanization etc.).
 The transformations are considered only as long as the sorting criteria
 is significant (using regions sorted based on popdensity for example would
 treat two regions with same popdensity as equivalent - this may or may
 not be desirable).

 in the above analysis.

 of the quantity consumed.

The notion of Scarcity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Scarcity can be a confusing term since it encompasses both a so-called physical
 scarcity (unavailability) and the perceived scarcity (what we feel as scarce).
 We'll assume that all felt scarcities are physically scarce (otherwise
 consumers would acquire the item that is meant to be scarce).
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $F\subset S$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 denotes the felt scarcities and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 the direct physical scarcities.
 Unfortunately, the perceptions of quality of life are entities that cannot
 be measured easily but still may qualify as felt scarcities.
 This makes the claims on scarcity as a driver of demand particularly difficult.
 The term scarcity in this study implies the notion of perceived scarcity
 (
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

) which may be affected by artificial unavailability or barriers (i.e.
 expanding 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 with entities available only through status competitions, advertising or
 other social-psychological communication).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Further, the nature of item matters for perceived scarcity since the direction
 of the effect of popularity on perceived scarcity can reverse depending
 on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

appeal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the item (visual or status-related).
 If everybody has a certain item, then consumers may not consider it so
 important to acquire the item (since everyone else already has it) whereas
 for other types of item, consumers may rush to the item solely because
 there is a trend amongst everybody else to acquire.
 These are the snob and bandwagon types of item considered in the literature

If 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is the set of items that one feels are scarce and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is the set that is physically or socially difficult to achieve (unavailable
 and/or unaffordable) then we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $F\subset S$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 there can be items that are physically scarce (not available and/or not
 affordable) have a tendency to be be felt scarce.
 In other words, all items that are felt as scarce must be scarce - either
 physically or socially (otherwise consumers would purchase it).
 Thus items that are not scarce (i.e.
 both affordable and available) cannot be felt as scarce.
 Conditions for physical scarcity - when included with snob and bandwagon
 effects must capture all conditions for scarcity i.e.
 we cover all felt scarcities with a generic definition of a physical scarcity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The goal of sorting the commodities by their appeal (or perceived scarcity)
 is to see how closely list of top appeals matches with the list of visible
 items.
 Within the items that are scarce, the visible commodities (i.e.
 those that are talked about often in society) might have higher income
 elasticities and exhibit variations across social clusters.
 The analysis attempts to view an overall alignment of visible ranking with
 that of scarcity ranking.

If the four parameters where strictly binary (i.e.
 if an item was available or not, affordable or not, popular or not and
 was bandwagon or snob), then order of appeals would be as shown in the
 table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:AppealRanking"

\end_inset

 - with appeals ranked from low to high for every tuple of the 4 four parameters
 (16 in total).
 An available, affordable and popular bandwagon would have a higher appeal
 than an unavailable, unaffordable and and unpopular bandwagon item and
 so on.
 Notice that popular bandwagon and unpopular snob type items are given the
 same rank if availability and affordability is the same for them.
 Another key feature of the ranking is that availability and affordability
 make a snob item less interesting while they both increase the appeal of
 the bandwagon item.
 If we were to map the appeal from these four parameters in a linear function
 it may look something like:

\begin_inset Formula $-(1-b)\rho(\alpha+mb\aleph)+b(1-\rho)(\alpha+mb\aleph)+b\rho(\alpha+mb\aleph+\kappa)+(1-b)(1-\rho)(\alpha+mb\aleph+\kappa)=K_{1}+\kappa K_{2}$

In the decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}+\kappa K_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}$
\end_inset

 represents the appeal for misaligned items (unpopular bandwagon and popular
 snob) while 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2}$
\end_inset

 represents the aligned items (popular bandwagon and unpopular snob).
 Appeal of a bandwagon item is only affected by a constant factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa b\rho$
\end_inset

 in addition to the purchase concern: 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha+mb\aleph$
\end_inset

.
 If an item is a snob item then popularity switches the sign of appeal from
 negative 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho=1)$
\end_inset

 to positive 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho=0)$

Utility and Status - extensions to the model for appeal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The concept of status is rather non-trivial and has characteristics of a
 feedback system in the long-run (status may yield income through social
 barriers but requires income to be acquired).
 The Ireland model used in the literature treats status-signaling as purchasing
 of visible and non-visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

.
 In the Ireland model, the combined utility for every consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $U=F(f(v,w),s)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)$
\end_inset

 is the private utility of the consumer and status 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be an increasing function of inference of others - 
\begin_inset Formula $s=f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - with 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 denoting visual consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 - the consumption that is not directly observable.
 Every consumer thus optimizes the combined private and visible utility.
 A practical consideration in the model is the separation between visible
 and non-visible consumption - a boundary that requires a socio-cultural
 judgment and has been drawn using consumer surveys in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
What research in the developing markets further points out is that the parameter
 of combined utility in a simplified model - (
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)\cdot f(v,w)+a\cdot f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - can vary for different sections of society.
 A slight adjustment of the model may be to add another parameter that indicates
 the consumer's social class.
 This may be relevant in the developing world where social status is yielded
 through social barriers.
 Sections of society that are endowed with a higher status capital may be
 in less of a need to purchase commodities of visible consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In the analysis of LSMS data on Tanzania so far, urban/rural differences
 have significance in the consumption of scarce commodities.
 There are two ways to incorporate this into a model of signaling - one
 is to consider these household characteristics as a social class of consumers
 so that different sensitivities for social classes is noted.
 The other is to consider these characteristics as part of conspicuous consumpti
on in the long-run.
 For example, English literacy seems to have correlation with the consumption
 of certain scarce products in Tanzania.
 In the model of scarcity, English literacy (along with urban residence
 and other characteristics significant for consumption of scarce commodities)
 would be seen as a status commodity (capital) that is acquired through
 spending on education or migration (or other relevant commodities).
 The latter is the approach to be followed in the extensions to the appeal
 model in Section

\begin_layout Subsection
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
A caution against circular interpretations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Notice that one needs to be careful while drawing conclusions based on consumpti
on of commodities that are themselves selected based on the percentiles
 of consumption levels.
 The threshold method that we use to select scarce commodities (that are
 likely to be visible) - considers items that i) are accessible by no more
 than 50% of the consumers and ii) have their expenditure rising with permanent
 income.
 These are - by definition - items that the rich are more likely to afford.
 We cannot select items that the only richer section of society indulges
 in and claim that people spending on these selected items indicate higher
 status.
 Such a claim is only a restatement of the high permanent income and says
 nothing more substantial than that the richer population sections signal
 higher status.
 It would be a fallacy to associate visible consumption with household character
istics by only associating household characteristics with permanent income.
 The threshold method that we use only measures the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scarcity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the item (e.g.
 electricity is more scarce than food) - not status or visibility per se
 - which involve some socio-cultural judgment.
 That scarcity itself has an indirect effect on status competitions cannot
 be denied - but this effect is not measured by the threshold method of

In recent decades, the urban settlements in Africa have seen massive overpopulat
ion and development of the services sector.
 The differences in urban-rural lifestyles have increased.
 The scarcity of services and of industrial goods (which would be a necessity
 in the Western world) seem evidently sparse in the developing countries
 (a claim that is verified by data on Tanzania).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
A relevant question amidst these developments is whether a consumer prefers
 a larger house over installation of electricity or not.
 As a commodity, electricity is both scarce and visible - as it opens up
 more lifestyle choices.
 A survey detailed in the next sections aims to test the presence of a preferenc
e for electricity (and other scarce goods) - but as is, the data suggests
 significant urban-rural differences across regions in Tanzania.
 In a Hirschian sense, a congestion

 is likely to exist for electricity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
A general view on scarcity would allow us to classify the commodities based
 on their scarcity and quantify the urban-rural differences better.
 The survey detailed in next sections may further help measure the impact
 of such scarcities on consumer preferences.
 It is noted that many of the items are scarce together (carpets and housing-sta
tus, electricity and hobby equipment, etc.) .
 It is through such denial of goods and services that status perceptions
 develop.
 A simple view of observed scarcities can be provided by a directed graph
 of items for classification - where a node is an item and points to other
 nodes/items that it denies (which themselves can be formed with items that
 deny other items and so and so forth).
 For example, electricity can be a node in this graph with connections to
 equipment and electronics but no connection to food items.
 The disconnected nodes in the graph - would be least likely to be affected
 by another unreachable node in the graph.
 The criteria of connections (denials) would be determined by statistical
 significance e.g.
 rice and walnuts appear would not be scarce together if one of them is
 available and affordable by both higher and lower quantiles of permanent
 income of society.

.
 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{skincreamconsu}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that
 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.

Effect of occupation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Income data in LSMS is not available for all the surveyed households.
 This may indicate the presence of informal sector in Tanzania.
 A few occupations in the survey are neither well defined nor are truly
 an indicator of total income.
 The presence of categories like unpaid-family-work and of individuals with
 no-primary-job getting a significant income from their secondary occupations
 makes the task of associating the primary occupation of the household head
 with her income rather difficult (i.e.
 occupation - which is available for all household heads cannot be used
 as a proxy of household income - which is not available for all households
 in the survey).
 Grouping the occupations into fewer categories than in the survey (by putting
 paid/unpaid family work and agriculture under the same category for example)
 allows for the smoothening of the effect of individual occupations and
 may serve as a proxy of socioeconomic classes in the country.
 Without or without this grouping, the effect of occupation has been found
 significant on the consumption of scarce commodities.
 The results are shown in Table

With a significant migration from rural areas, one of the claims to be tested

 and the number of members minus the number of children) .

 in the Western consumer world.
 The clustering might not be as clear-cut in the developing world - where
 social stratification is severe and many services are contractual (non-monetary
).
 The socio-cultural barriers might have an effect through access to services.

Towards that claim, English education as a control parameter is found quite
 significant for positional consumption.
 Those who identify themselves as English speakers tend to spend more on
 scarce commodities.
 This indicates that English education may be quite scarce - and while it
 isn't reflected in the consumer expenditure market data so easily - it's
 likely to play a role in status competitions.

While a commodity for private consumption (e.g.
 skin-cream or hobby-equipment in the LSMS data) might have an appeal for
 everyone - whether it signals high-status or not is a social psychological
 concern and cannot be assessed from the household survey by itself.
 In the absence of a visibility survey (asking the respondents how much
 they notice a product and whether they associate the product with high-income
 or not), one may still continue the discussion of the potential conspicuous
 value of items by looking at how scarce the item is (based on the percentile
 of consumers of the commodity).
 This is akin to repeating the analysis of visible expenditure with a given
 commodity as the only constituent of the visibility basket.
 The percentile of consumers using a given commodity (e.g.
 top 22% for electricity) and the slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(commodity-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $log(total-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 can tell us if richer sections of society spend more on a certain commodity
 and if the poorer sections of society consume the chosen commodity at all
 (the commodities chosen in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 are those where this slope is significant).
 The regression based on data prepared from the last step attempts to calculate
 the coefficients of the following equation:

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression-2}

 A column in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 also suggests the percentile of consumers using the commodity (electricity
 for example is used amongst those having top 22% of total expenditure).
 The usage of commodities such as skincream and other-personal-products
 (shampoos, razors etc.) are widespread compared with sports or hobby equipment
 and electricity.
 For commodities that are rare and consumed only amongst the richer sections
 of the society (those with higher total expenditure) the effect of English
 literacy is significant.
 Similarly, hsize has a significant effect on both educational expense and
 personal products (using number of children instead of hsize could provide
 better association with education expense).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
We cannot claim from the results that the population spends more on status
 commodities than education.
 What we can claim however, is that electricity is more scarce than education.
 Further, in areas where food is expensive, spending on marriage reduces
 - particularly by the occupations that may bring higher incomes.
 This marks a preference towards industrial goods in the urban (expensive)
 areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Another observation that can possibly help in modeling scarcity is that
 scarcity of items seems to occur in clusters of objects.
 Carpets-rugs require a certain housing status and access to English depends
 on region.
 Similarly, many hobby equipment may require access to electricity etc.
 The clustering of these items essentially point to the urban-rural differences
 in the country.

.
 While the visibility surveys (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) attempt to study how consumption on certain commodities may signal status,
 the goal of the proposed game is to characterise environments under which
 the perceptions of a higher-status may develop.
 The game attempts to emulate i) the consumer market and ii) the mechanism
 through which status may be assigned within a group of consumers.
 It therefore relies on participants playing the dual role of a consumer
 and status-observer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The activities of purchasing and assigning status are separate in the game.
 Since a simulated purchase performed by the participants in the game (given
 a list of commodities, prices and outlay) is quite likely to deviate from
 their real world purchases and their real needs, the participants are instead
 asked what additional items they would purchase for a given a basket of
 commodities that they already possess (using a cumulative voting scheme
 that emulates selection of commodities in a market - see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Purchasing_Mechanism"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The second part of the game emulates status assignment - where participants
 assign a score of status and effectiveness each to 3 (or more) other participan
ts in the game by looking at the quantities of the item categories possessed
 and purchased by the latter.
 The judgment of status in the real world does not involve direct observance
 of prices and thus it is only the quantity of the identified items consumed
 or already possessed that matters in the status-assignment part of the
 game.
 The end-goal of the game is to purchase a basket most desired by others
 - the winner achieves this goal by purchasing commodities of her choice
 that are most desirable by everyone and are indicative of a rank higher
 than everyone else in the game.

It is difficult for players to conduct a

\end_inset

 in a way that truly represents their needs.
 Hence, instead of asking the respondent how they'll spend the given outlay
 of a 1000 dollars over a set of commodities, they are asked how they would
 spend the additional 100 dollars for a given 1000 dollars of outlay (or
 more) value of items that they already have stocked up.
 The

 While the

\end_inset

stock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is made of non-positional items, the participants choose 3 items from a
 mix of non-positional items and positional items - given the 10% extra
 outlay.
 Since all participants cannot be assumed to be equally numerate, the game
 uses a scheme similar to cumulative voting - where 10 virtual coins are
 provided to the participant and the participant is asked to distribute
 the coins amongst a set of available items (both positional and non-positional).
 The provided outlay in the game (number of coins) may vary for participants
 - in proportion to the income distribution that is observed in the relevant
 consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS for Tanzania).

While the basket for every consumer can be varied to model urban/rural differenc

 game ensures that all participants have reasonably similar consumer universe.

 basket (i.e.
 all baskets have the same set of categories).

Constraints and Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The game attempts to measure status and consumption with respect to high
 asset ownership, social class or familial responsibility.
 Since players choose between physical needs and positional needs in the
 game, a different circumstance is likely to affect their choice and hence
 their perceived status.
 The game presents a precondition to the player - indicating high asset
 ownership, a chosen social class or a familial liability.
 For example, to test a participant's choice between food and electricity,
 the game can present a large family as a constraint, and record the choice
 between spending more on food vs installing electricity.
 The game thus measures indirect effects of reward or constraints on status
 by allowing participants to gauge the suitability of a participant's choice
 in the status game in the presence of constraints (familial) or rewards
 (asset-related).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Notice that the constraint variable is only planned to be binary in the
 current scheme i.e.
 it is either a reward or a liability (when present).
 The two values are expected to have an opposite affect on the purchase
 of new items.
 Admittedly, the binary values of constraints vs rewards circumvent the
 difficulty in comparisons between disparate needs of the consumers - e.g.
 a large family, senior member or a social event (e.g.
 marriage/funeral).
 While a multi-valued variable (if adopted) can potentially provide better
 insights into the relative effects of these several types constraints,
 the goal of the current exercise is to test for a direct effect of constraints
 on status (rather than relative effect of the various possible constraints).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Status ranking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The status-ranking activity involves a student assigning a status score
 by looking at i) what the other participant with a given income level does
 with the extra outlay and ii) what the participant already possesses.
 In the ranking scheme, the participants provide a score on effectiveness
 as well as status to all the other (3 or more) participants observed.
 Notice that in presence of constraints specified in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

, regardless of whether one is selfish or not, a participant would tend
 to penalise someone else who she thinks is going to be more selfish than
 herself.
 Since the game provides a way to penalize selfishness by status ranks,
 the participants are discouraged from indicating status through overspending
 on positional items.
 The penalty for not caring for a sick parent may be huge in the society
 but so can be the penalty for being stingy.
 Similarly, while some may want to indicate wealth by buying a watch they
 may also fear disrespect for not taking care of a sick family member.
 The scores on effectiveness and status are thus not only a way to discourage
 the consumer from limiting the unrealistic purchases in the simulated purchasin
g part of the game, they also track the effect of the externalities such
 as sickness or age (measured through the binary variable discussed in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
While consumers try to maximise their utility by purchasing more items for
 a given limited outlay - they also manage their prestige by letting others
 have a better opinion of themselves.
 The status game can thus be seen as an enhanced version of the survey that
 asks people to imagine a neighbour who spends more than them on a chosen
 commodity (used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

).
 The proposed game attempts to measure how consumers might act given a certain
 circumstances while both status and welfare (effectiveness score can be
 seen as a proxy of concern for others) become part of the payoff function
 in the game.

Welfare and Status competitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The solution of this game for a set of rational players remains a pending
 exercise in this study.
 The key motivation for the analysis at this point is that fundamentally
 all social welfare concerns are concerns of Pareto optimality.
 Moreover, the payoff function for effectiveness in the game is meant to
 be a proxy for welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
With Pareto optimality in mind, more spending on education, health seems
 desirable - but it may be become distant for consumers due to their immediate
 needs - whether positional or non-positional.
 A comparison with what is observed in consumption data versus what is observed
 about positional consumption in games can provide some insight into the
 social status that can influence the desired welfare equilibrium.

Policy implications

The discussion so far leans towards permitting status competitions rather
 than attempting to tax or control them.
 This is in line with the suggestions offered by Robert H Frank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 favouring a non-monetary market of statuses only so that status games (which
 are a necessity) do not overlap with the market for real goods.
 Due to structural reasons of the modern economy, advertising efforts can
 turn a social scarcity into a physical scarcity (to use the Hirsch's terminolog
y
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"

\end_inset

).
 A profit-driven industry and the advertising pursued by the companies tend
 to increase the status competition for a commodity.
 Instead of letting status competitions modify the distribution of that
 physical goods through competition (and thus do little to avoid the problem
 of physical scarcities in the developing countries), policy can attempt
 to provide status-games in a world of non-necessity items - in some ways
 to diffuse the status competitions in the society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In poor and non-pecuniary societies, the desire to become rich or the benefit
 of inheriting money and education is often less reachable.
 Status and money translate into social securities in unstructured societies.
 These may well be detected in the countries in Africa - but limited data
 on household characteristics in Tanzania (related to ethnicity or religion)
 have prevented us from such an analysis for Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The question that we seek the answer for in the context of Tanzania (or
 another developing country) is whether the expenditure on high-status or
 scarce items (an analysis similar to one conducted by Prais Houthakker
 for expensive and cheap tea varieties amongst social classes in the UK
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerFamilySurvey"

\end_inset

) - is actually more desirable than on housing and education.
 The designed experiment intends to find answer to this question.
 If the answer is indeed the former, then it makes sense to limit the status
 competitions through policy to support status competitions on non-essential
 items (possibly by introducing brand differentiation).
 Attaching glamour to education, healthcare and food items may help consumers
 prioritize their needs.

Effect of Price on food vs non-food items

Price Changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The literature has not used panel data analysis in the context of conspicuous
 consumption.
 While an influence of rising prices can complicate the analysis of visible
 consumption indicators, the insights from demand elasticities are essential
 to understanding the relative effect of status-related consumption against
 other commodities.
 Higher price of food items may suppress consumption on food - but one cannot
 answer whether an increase in price of food suppresses its consumption
 more than it suppresses consumption of non-food items or not - without
 an estimation of demand elasticities.
 Such details of consumption patterns are basket-dependent and are not accessibl
e without a record of prices of all types of items in the basket.
 Unfortunately, a lack of prices for non-food items in the LSMS prevent
 this much desired time-series analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Even though an analysis on non-food prices is inaccessible with the unavailabili
ty of price data in most consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS), a time-series analysis based on food prices alone can provide insights
 into the pressures on food consumption.
 Using historical prices on calorie consumption in India, Deaton and Jean
 Dreze point out that the overall calorie consumption has declined while
 the total outlay has increased in India (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"

\end_inset

).
 The change in positional value of food - determined by price differentiation
 in the market and scarcity - can potentially help explain some of this
 decline.
 While such a decline is reported to be less in the case of sub-Saharan
 African countries than in India, the regional differences within the country
 could be explained by the change of food's position in the consumer universe
 (i.e.
 the so-called

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Congestion - a related phenomenon - is subject to demand and supply for
 a particular commodity and can be measured.
 If we were to consider food, for example, a limited supply and overpopulation
 can increase competition.
 Similarly, for entertainment, censorship and introduction of internet can
 create new competitions (congestion).
 For housing, new constructions and overpopulation can cause congestion.
 These are commodity-specific instances and a focus on selected items may
 be the only way to test whether the changes in consumption patterns for
 the chosen commodity are explained by new scarce items and the competition
 caused for them.
 The data from Tanzania - so far - only seems to point that availability
 of services in urban and rural area can potentially cause some congestion
 (competitions for scarce items).

Food prices from LSMS - a preliminary analysis

Scarcity is interpreted in terms of availability and affordability in the
 study.
 The geographical regions may need to be understood in terms of scarcity.
 Further, population density and migration data may provide better insights
 in the interplay of food and non-food consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
It is noted that in certain areas in Tanzania - prices for food vary a lot
 more than they do in others.
 This is a phenomenon that varies from commodity to commodity.
 For example, the prices for onions and sugar don't vary so much by area
 code as they do for meat and chicken.
 The regions Dar-es-salaam, Mbeya mwanza, Mjini/Magharini unguja stand out
 for higher prices for multiple items.
 In a preliminary analysis, a indicator dummy for these regions is found
 significant - but it is also noted that these areas are urban settlements
 where electricity is available and population is significantly high (See
 Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{popregreg2simple2}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Certain food items for example, have more price-differences overall than
 others - rice (husked), maize(grain), sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, groundnut
s(shelled), goat meat, chicken and canned milk correspond to numerous (>4)
 region-codes where they're reportedly sold in different prices ranges.
 While it is tempting to claim that price differences in the market indicate
 that there is more price-differentiation and possibly more competition
 - one needs to consider the overall scarcity of the commodity (the percentiles
 of the commodity expenditure in the threshold method) as well as the preference
 for the item amongst the rich (measured by higher expenditure with income)
 for the item to be considered a status-signaling item.
