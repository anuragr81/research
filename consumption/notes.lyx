\begin_layout Section
Demand Analysis - Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marketing and supply concerns have been ignored for the current stage
 of the study.
 The study of demand encompasses the household surveys in Tanzania and UK
 - inspecting the income elasticities of chosen commodities.
 The analysis focuses on Engel curves for the commodities and temporarily
 avoids the time-series analysis of incomes and prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Cross Section Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a population is observed for a sufficiently long time, then we can understand
 the effects of changing incomes, price variations on their choices.
 A significant degree of demand analysis from panel data comes out of the
 Slutsky equation approach (e.g.
 the well-known AIDS model - a particular version of the Rotterdam model).
 With no time-series data, on the other hand, one relies on price-variations
 within the cross-section and interpretations of commodity-elasticities
 (instead of effects of changing income on a monitored household).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By adding more parameters to the semi-logarithmic model, one runs the risk
 of overfitting.
 It is easy, in other words, to stress on transient parameters in a given
 cross-sectional snapshot.
 The calibration of a cost-function and imposition of general conditions
 on the demand equations can get around some of these problems.

Analysis by Prais-Houthakker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Houthakker attributes the popularity of Engel curves to the idea of equivalence
 scales (i.e.
 how different households achieve same level of living standard).
 Although Houthakker's Engel fitting would now be considered unashamedly
 pragmatic 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, his research was influential in popularising the use of income and expenditure
 elasticities in cross-sectional analyses

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest Engel curves are set up with the Woking-Leser model hitherto
 used in the study:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{i}=\beta\cdot log\ x_{i}+\alpha
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, budget share total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

, budget share
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$
\end_inset

 are regression coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A noticeable shortcoming with the Woking-Leser model is that no commodity
 specific information is used in the semi-logarithmic equation.
 The current study attempts to enhance this model with household and geographic
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cost Function and the Gorman Model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gorman approach considers a more general Engel curve: 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\sum_{r\epsilon R}a_{ir}(p)\Phi_{r}(ln(x))$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is a finite set and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{r}(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 are general functions).
 For these to be consistent, one arrives at the cost function: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\ ln\ c(u,p)}{\partial\ ln\ p_{i}}=\sum_{r\epsilon R}a_{ir}(p)\Phi_{r}\{ln\ c(u,p)\}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $u=$
\end_inset

utility, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=$
\end_inset

price).
 Gorman derives following restrictions on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{n}(\cdot)$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
w_{i} & =a_{i}(p)+b_{i}(p)ln\ x+d_{i}(p)\sum_{m=1}^{M}\gamma_{m}(p)(ln\ x)^{m}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
w_{i} & =a_{i}(p)+b_{i}(p)\sum_{\sigma_{m}\epsilon S_{-}}\mu_{m}(p)x^{\sigma_{m}}+d_{i}(p)\sum_{\sigma_{m}\epsilon S_{+}}^{M}\theta_{m}(p)x^{\sigma_{m}}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a finite set of elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $S_{-}$
\end_inset

 its negative elements and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{+}$
\end_inset

A significant amount of research has been done in scaling of the individual
 model (through the analysis of the so-called cost-of-children problem).
 Muellbauer has enhanced the model by considering every household a multiple
 of unit 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{h}$
\end_inset

 (individual).
 One considers a multiplicative index 
\begin_inset Formula $m(a^{h},u^{h})$
\end_inset

such that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
c^{h}(u^{h},p,a^{h}) & =m(a^{h},u^{h})\cdot c(u^{h},p)

 This has been employed for LSMS data in the current study.
 To address spatial variations, Deaton use the following model for a cluster-bas
ed analysis:

\begin_layout Standard
Here, quantity of good 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 consumed by cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $c$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{Gic}$
\end_inset

, the associated unit-value is 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{Gic}$
\end_inset

, total expenditure is 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{Gic}$
\end_inset

, a vector of household demographic characteristics is 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{Gic}$
\end_inset

 Two error terms used consist of i) a cluster-specific random effect 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{Gc}$
\end_inset

along with the error 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{Gic}^{0}$
\end_inset

and ii) idiosyncratic error

 The computation of variance-covariance vectors

Attempts to improve the regression were made by considering asset-ownership
 and number of young members in addition to total size of the household
 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{h}$
\end_inset

(note that the prices are assumed constant during the snapshot of the recorded
 week).
 The clustering effect was not found significant for cheaper commodities.
 Also, as expected, the size of the household (i.e.
 number of family members) is a more significant indicator of consumption
 of commodities like sugar than for fruits or meat.

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is found inferred prices do vary quite a bit amongst different commodities.
 However, this variation is significantly lower for subsistence sugar (or
 beans) - the price for which don't vary as much as they do for meat.
 In a fashion similar to Prais - Houthakker

(who visit the price variation of Tea to find that for a given income households
 of smaller size buy more expensive varieties of tea in the UK), the quality
 and quantity elasticities were derived based on classification of commodities
 according to price (inferred).

Prais-Houthakker model the combination of quantity vs quality as : 
\begin_inset Formula $dq_{i}=p_{i}\delta p_{i}+k_{i}\delta k_{i}$
\end_inset

 (change in quality - indicated by price and change in quantity indicated
 by quantity).
 This leads to :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\frac{{x}}{q_{i}}\frac{\partial q_{i}}{\partial x} & =\frac{{x}}{k_{i}}\frac{\partial k_{i}}{\partial x}+\frac{{x}}{p_{i}}\frac{\partial p_{i}}{\partial x}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prais-Houthakker derive quantity elasticity as difference between expenditure
 elasticity and the quality elasticity.
 The quality-adjustment to the quantity can provide more insight in the
 factors affecting expensive consumption (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Analyzing the tea-consumption in the UK, for example, Prais-Houthakker
 find small-size families spending proportionately higher on expensive tea
 varieties.
 The quality elasticities obtained in a similar fashion for alcohol, fruits
 and meat in Tanzania, show significant differences in quality elasticities
 across income groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current study notes elasticity differences between expensive and less-expens
ive varieties - leaving us with quality-elasticities.
 However, at this point, a correlation of these elasticities with perceived
 conspicuous consumption, although methodical, is a rather subjective exercise.
 This is intended to be improved with a more robust utility-theory based
 approach (research by Ireland
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Towards that goal, I intend to develop methods to test separability in the
 context of conspicuous consumption - instead of assuming weak-separability
 of different commodity groups.
 The index prices obtained for these commodity groups are planned to be
 used for better estimates on expenditure elasticities.

 Deaton notes a characteristic drop in consumption of food in developing
 countries (relative to other commodities)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"

\end_inset

.
 There are local factors that tend to stand out in developing countries
 - e.g.
 funeral expenditures in Swaziland.
 There is ample evidence to show that other commodities compete with welfare-rel
ated commodities (e.g.
 healthy food or financial investments).
 Banerjee et al.
 do not attribute this to temptation - but to lack of health insurance and
 sufficient cash (letting medicines and maintenance of work become more
 important than children's education or healthy food).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also worth noting that often times consumption on products/services
 that provide welfare could be less just because the quality of these services
 is extremely low in developing countries (e.g.
 education provided by the public sector).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In observed social changes, clustering based on religion or social groups
 is found significant in consumer behaviour (e.g.
 In India, muslims are influenced more by other muslims and hindus in the
 same locality [p118]).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory of impatience, despite its appeal, makes less sense for the poor
 and is considered irrelevant for the current study - since the evidence
 shows that poor tend to make choices as rational as their richer counterparts.
 Moderate success of microfinance (despite concerns with credit monitoring
 and administration) offers one such instance.
 Against the intuition, the poor seem to have sufficient hunger for saving
 methods and go the extra mile to save for future (even though saving is
 far more stressful for them).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, one cannot get carried away with the opportunities that poverty
 can create.
 Banjerjee et al.
 also note that it is the lack of regular employment that makes the poor
 more likely entrepreneurs (even though their success rate is much lower)
 - not the psychological

Summary of studies on conspicuous consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An obvious objection would be that mechanisms of visibility prevalent in
 the developed economies are a lot different from the developing countries.
 I have argued that the recent splurge of industrial goods has made the
 nature of visibility all too clear.
 Still, evidence of visibilty can be provided by obtaining data in the local
 newspapers or other media.
 The visibility index used by Heffetz provides data on commodity classes
 with a much finer granularity that can be provided by viewing linguistic
 data - hence a comparison with the visibility index details is to conducted
 as part of this study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous study, I had skipped the robustness tests (e.g.
 Hausman tests) results.
 This is conducted in the current note.
 Friehe-Mechtel study considers the robustness of the east-germany dummy
 by trying out various criteria of the visible consumption as detailed in
 Charles and Heffetz studies.

A rural setting is hardly filled with visible.
 What Pankaj Mishra describes as the sleepy railway town of the 1980s -
 was a place where glossy magazine papers evoked wonder.
 The visual splurge offered by the new development must offer new venues
 of visible consumption.
 In the new system of individualism, what used to be offered by the conversation
s is now directly through individual consumption.
 Spending on marriage can be replaced by spending on electronics.
 The current study wishes to detect this change in consumption.

The difference between the developing and developed countries cause endogeneity

 The severe limitation is really that access to newspapers is still limited
 to the higher economic strata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We cannot get away without recording of converstaions amongst the people.
 A survey is one way to deal with it - the better way yet is to intercept
 communications.
 Whatsapp or Facebok business data could be useful.
 Newspaper boards, local newspapers, college newspapers could provide proportion
al value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LSMS itself has some visible expenditure categories.
 Mixing the diary method with the recall method is not without its problems.
 That is why both the regression must be repeated for the two types of data.
 The weekly data is mixed with yearly data - this requires a normalization
 which can overestimate consumptions.
 This would not be a problem is the multiplication is done in the same way
 for the whole population of respondents (i.e.
 everyone is equally likely to overspend in the recorded week).
