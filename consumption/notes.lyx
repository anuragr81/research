The reasons for conspicuous consumption in the developing countries seem
 minimal if one considers the Maslow hierarchy.
 The study suggests the measurement of relative benefits to status from
 consumption and the differences in consumption across social hierarchies
 before asserting the existence or absence of conspicuous consumption in
 the developing countries.
 The study also develops a price-based status signaling model which can
 be used to understand the changing consumer basket in the sub-Saharan African
 countries - where recent large-scale urban migrations and proliferation
 of industrial products have followed an era of national planning.
 A behavioural model for status as expectation of higher income in the intertemp
oral substitution problem is also developed as part of this exercise.

 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism is inherent in all exchange of goods and services (including

Many studies related to conspicuous consumption have relied on a visibility
 survey - which quantifies the lot of complex interactions in what may constitut
e status competitions in a society.
 A luxury item - for example - needs to be marketed as a luxury for it to
 both impart visible signals to others and to improve self-perception of
 the buyer.
 In Veblen's original framework, for a product to indicate status it must
 be rare and superfluous (thus serve as an exploit).
 That a watch is more noticeable than an insurance policy (and associated
 with higher income) is not entirely relevant to this framework.
 Moreover, whether a poor person buying a cheap watch and a richer person
 buying an expensive watch (probably subject to import restrictions) are
 both instances of conspicuous consumption or not depends on the context
 that the observer chooses.
 Cheap watches may or may not constitute conspicuous consumption - depending
 on the social welfare function.
 The wide variety of criteria in conspicuous consumption seem to indicate
 this ambiguity (See Table

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

In both the developed and developing worlds, conspicuous consumption is
 driven by perceived scarcity and competition (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 If status were imparted by inherited wealth alone, there would be little
 conspicuous consumption as the consumers would be quick to realise the
 futility of buying trinkets.
 In the developed world, where markets have evolved to address the demands
 of the population, the positional pressures are readily addressed by market
 forces - thus a preference for visible goods indicates a higher price on
 them and a higher consumption on visible products always 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

signals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a higher status (a product with a higher status symbol would automatically
 carry a higher price).
 In underdeveloped markets, where information asymmetries are abound, the
 higher signalling (for conspicuous consumption) would not necessarily be
 achieved with higher spending on visible goods - and other factors (e.g.
 social standing, asset ownership, social networks and education) start
 to matter in the combined utility function - as is suggested by data from
 various cross-section expenditure surveys.
 These other mechanisms of signaling - although not part of purchases -
 fall under Veblen's view of conspicuous consumption.

Scarcity - A term used by Fred Hirsch in a theory to explain distribution
 of resources in a society.
 Scarcity is the perceived or real lack of products or services created
 by a competition for them which is intensified by population growth ( through
 increased productivity and time costs).
 Scarcities can be either direct or indirect and thus - physical or social.
 Hirsch also points out that social scarcities are becoming physical scarcities
 (so this distinction isn't so clear after all).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

Congestion - The competition for resources in the context of modern Western
 society where physical scarcities (severe shortages of food and shelter)
 have been largely conquered.
 In Hirsch's theory, congestion is a side-effect of commercialization and
 removal of older social barriers.
 Since all goods and amenities are available through money, the competition
 and scarcity for what used to be accessible to only the top few have intensifie
d.
 With economic progress therefore, consumers are more - not less - driven
 by status needs than before.
 Writing in what is now called the affluent

 It encompasses not just goods available for purchase in the market (that
 are bought by consumers to improve their perceived status) - but also the
 barriers that may indicate status through rareness.
 Veblen's was a rather unconventional attempt to link the social barriers
 with expenditure

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A robber baron, Veblen says, has a better chance of escaping the law than
 a small crook because “a well-bred expenditure of his booty especially
 appeals to persons of a cultivated sense of the proprieties and goes far
 to mitigate the sense of moral turpitude with which his dereliction is
 viewed by them.” Scholars do not ordinarily associate the disposal of ill-gotten
 wealth with good breeding (quoted from Galbraith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GalbraithEssential"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Veblen's focus had been the consumption patterns of the richer section
 of society and the way conspicuous consumption is understood is through
 to inference of status through continued search for expensive or rare items.
 Veblen provides a psychological framework to explain the competitions that
 have survived since barbaric times when insignia were used to indicate
 status.
 Status indication - as is noted in the study in the context of developing
 countries - can extend beyond the purchase of items in the market.

 In the Europe of eighteenth century, he argued, the rich could pursue their

 but in the modern society - where basic needs had largely been fulfilled

 goods and advertisement had a major role to play

Hirsch's model for positional competitions is explained in the Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:HirschsModel"

\end_inset

.
 With the physical scarcity of goods (food and amenities) largely conquered,
 scarcity becomes largely social in the developed countries.
 More commercialization (availability of previous unavailable items through
 money) leads to more scarcities and more competitions - hence instances
 of congestion for a good develop - leading to increased positional competition
 in the society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key issue in developing an empirical understanding the relationship between
 congestion and scarcity is of semantic nature.
 Scarcity seems a more general concept than mere unavailability or low supply
 of an item - as it seems to entail both unavailability of the item and
 the competition for it.
 Hirsch does differentiate between the physical scarcity (unavailability)
 and social scarcity (competition) but he also concludes that the boundary
 between physical and social scarcities can get blurred as the positional
 goods create a market for themselves.
 In this view, the difference between scarcity of an item and competitions
 for the item is no longer trivial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measuring and empirically verifying the cultural trends identified by both
 Hirsch and Veblen is far from triviel - even if we were provided the access
 to a reliable microdata on consumption sampled over varied social identities
 and extending over a period of decades, it is difficult to track and measure
 the nature of connections between individuals and the influences social
 groups have on each other.
 The perceptions of quantities like status are not directly measurable -
 and our understanding of the psychological motivations for consumption
 is still under development.
 Operating in a more controlled environment, behavioural sciences often
 create contexts where subjects can choose amongst well-defined options.
 While it is difficult to scale up results from such smaller, often artificial,
 environments to higher levels of organisation in the society, but such
 experiments remain an important tool to identify factors that have a clear
 impact on human motivations for consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inspired by this possibility, we test for presence of status competitions
 in empirical data on consumption - instead of attempting to comment on
 wide-ranging cultural trends.
 For the implicit assumption that the status competitions are inherent in
 human society, we bank on Robert Frank's argument that striving to achieve
 more than others is likely to be ingrained in our hormones(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 The empirical examples to support for this argument are abound.
 Exploring incomes amongst professors competing for grants - for example
 - Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 notes that neither the Permanent Income model nor the productivity model
 explains the distribution of income.
 What offers a better explanation is the presence of status competition
 among the professors.
 Similarly, he demonstrates that in the absence of monopolies, it becomes
 difficult for corporations to survive by rewarding talent alone and they
 are thus compelled to depend on status competitions for income distribution

 The current study does not attempt to relate status competitions - which
 operate at finer levels in society (particularly in the institutions of
 family and similar social networks) - to wider cultural trends.
 Instead, the focusses on measuring status competitions in the context of
 consumption.

\end_inset

 in the latter.
 It is tempting to think that the scarcities may be only physical in the
 developing countries (and probably as similar to those in the 18th century
 Europe), but the presence of status related competitions is still relevant
 (and in agreement with Veblen's claims).
 Conspicuous consumption is a side-effect of rising incomes and preliminary
 model which - as we outline - considers both the expected and current rise
 in income a driver of conspicuous consumption

With the context of conspicuous consumption narrowed to status competitions,
 we find a wealth of literature that finds status competitions to have an
 effect on consumption (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 Hirsch's ideas of scarcity and congestion are indeed relevant in the developing
 countries (scarcity being the lack of supply or unavailability of a particular
 commodity while congestion being the changes in income levels within social
 groups).
 The goal of conspicuous consumption in a developing economy - as much as
 anywhere else - is to allow a given population of individuals to associate
 themselves to those with perceived higher status (due to direct income
 or otherwise) in society.
 We wish to test if despite fundamental social changes in the developing
 countries, the status competitions may be perpetual - i.e.
 whether the security provided by the old status hierarchies can be translated
 into newer money-driven securities.

Status as lagged asset ownership and consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How societies perceive differences in status amongst themselves is difficult
 to record - let alone standardize it across multiple geographies.
 Relying on the consumption microdata, we only record the assets and income
 of individuals that the higher-status individuals are more likely to acquire
 than the low status individuals.
 Our view of status comprises strictly of i) possessions (assets and consumption
) and ii) the barriers to possessions.
 These status determinants enhance status by more consumption or more assets
 - in the sense that consumption and assets add to existing possessions.
 An individual is imparted a higher status when more barriers exist for
 others to acquire the possessions than those that exist for herself.
 It is even possible that possessions translate as status only through barriers
 (items that have no other value except through barriers that exist to acquire
 them).
 The role of conspicuous consumption then is to distort the status derived
 from other determinants of status.
 Through consumption, status items may be used to to overcome the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

barriers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to status (thus changing them).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buying an item that was previously limited to someone with a higher status
 than oneself invariably enhances one's status.
 Inherited or acquired assets also have the similar effect of enhancing
 one's status.
 However, the consumption on expendable items being more affordable than
 acquisition of long-term assets may imply prevalence of the former in societies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a model for status, the barriers can be quantified in terms of i) the
 weights of that personal characteristics of an individual carry (parameters
 such as locality, age, gender, ethnicity) or ii) the prices for assets
 or non-durable items in the market.
 More consumption on items that may changes one's perceived status may imply
 more perceived inequalities in the society.
 The model provided by Coreno et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 is instructive in this regard.
 The model (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

) considers a ranking function for every individual where consumption is
 seen as a way to transform the income ranking of a population i.e.
 individuals improve their perception in society through consumption (and/or
 asset ownership) to overcome their income rank in the society.
 It can be asserted that anyone in less than the highest income group (more
 specifically -the highest quantile of the all status determinants minus
 that of consumption) would benefit from a short-term expense on status-related
 consumption.
 Therefore, one can claim that the consumption rank (or utility) and non-consump
tion status rank (or utility) must differ for the consumers in medium quantiles
 - if conspicuous consumption exists in a society.
 This verification my serve as the test of conspicuous consumption (a similar
 inference may be drawn from the permanent income elasticity of conspicuous
 consumption within different quantiles of a population).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A discussion on barriers is incomplete without a clear definition of status
 - a ranking of consumption and asset ownership requires a specification
 of how expenditure or budget share is combined for the consumers.
 Unlike many other models for conspicuous consumption, we assume that all
 consumption items can impart status.
 We identify three factors that contribute to status through consumption
 (these are detailed in subsequent sections).
 Instead of agreeing on a crisp boundary between conspicuous and non-conspicuous
 items, we attempt to develop a criterion to sort the items in terms of
 their status impact (i.e.
 the status utility that a consumer may derive).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A claim that we intend to test is whether the consumption on items that
 have a high impact on status must decrease (increase) with the decrease
 (increase) in gaps in assets and other barriers in the society over time.
 In other words, more significant differences in determinants of status
 must correspond to an increase in consumption of the consumers for those
 with a medium rank of status.
 A quantile regression on a time-series can test whether the purchases of
 status items is different across income quantiles of the society over time.

The developments of the last century in Africa and Asia - bear some similarity

 The growing competitions for status amongst the nascent working classes
 have been a subject of sociological study in the late 20th century.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, this competition was termed as Sanskritizat

 Since we have limited our scope to status competitions, we focus only on

 Further, we express status strictly in terms of possessions - which are

Status and Consumption in the Developing world
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in purchasing power between the sections of a society and
 the mobility between them are key drivers of status-related consumption.
 That status and mobility can contribute to the economic development of
 a society is a belief that goes back to Adam Smith - who had proposed that
 the economic progress can be achieved by letting an exchange between the
 rich and poor thrive.
 To use Wicksteed's words, trinkets could be turned into bread in this world-vie
w
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 One could argue that more spending on a conspicuous item would benefit
 the society as a whole - since the money obtained from the rich on the
 item could potentially fund employment and other opportunities.
 Electricity in Africa, for example, would be a model item for this purpose
 - an item whose consumption can drive the expansion of power plants and
 make electricity cheaper for everyone.
 More spending on signaling goods does not appear to be a social waste from
 this perspective.
 However, we note that not all marketable goods are as desirable as electricity
 and there may be goals more desirable than what the exchange between rich
 and poor can provide.

 In the developing world, on the other hand, the basic needs for the masses
 have still not been addressed.
 One could expect the exchange between rich and poor to draw the masses
 out of poverty - but we argue that there are limits to how much success
 can be achieved in the developing countries - the essential goods often
 lack robust markets in the developing countries and since marketable goods
 often create needs on their own, the development of market for conspicuous
 goods may prevent the status competitions from achieving the goals of social
 welfare.
 More so in the context of conspicuous consumption than elsewhere, an commodity
 exclusively available to the richer sections of the society can easily
 become a status good and thus the possibility of a social waste due to
 spending on status goods cannot be ruled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In other words, the limitations of status competitions matter in the developing
 world because the institutions in these countries are generally weak and
 have developed on the path to achieving goals of nationalism.
 The developing countries often face the problem of institutions just not
 being strong enough to allow the exchange between the rich and the poor
 to thrive.
 In the new urban settings in Africa, both tribal identities and the hierarchies
 formed through education, money or industrial assets can contribute to
 status competitions.
 While this development can encourage institutions of money and education

 What we consider as asset in the economy is any item that is owned on a
 permanent basis (rented or borrowed items are not considered assets, but
 gifted or inherited items are).
 The notion of wealth or permanent income is also seen as an asset in this
 view.

\begin_layout Standard

Status is a complex sociological phenomenon.
 While the buyer of an item indicates her status to the immediate local
 surroundings through her consumption, the items she ends up buying depend
 on more than just her preferences - since there can be wide disparities
 in the environments where consumers in a population reside.
 If the items available to the consumers in different regions within an
 economy are disparate, then it is no longer to trivial to identify items
 relevant for status and infer demographic unevenness in the purchase of
 status items.
\end_layout

Let's take example of the availability of electricity in Tanzania.
 If only the rich could afford electricity, then it being used by a smaller
 and richer part of the population may seem to have less significance than
 weddings - which are ubiquitous in the population (a regression with quantities
 consumed as dependent variable would bear more significance for items consumed
 by more consumers).
 One may be tempted to argue that items consumed by more people carry more
 significance for status than the item that is hardly accessible to the
 wider population, but status in a society is driven by both the supply
 of the item and the ability of the individual to purchase the item (disposable
 income).
 The interplay of supply, wealth and assets determine status in a society.

 cannot ignore how introduction of new industrial goods can create demand

 With the introduction of a new status item e.g.
 a new electronic product, there is a tendency amongst the consumers to
 flock towards the item.
 The demand for certain status items is enhanced by the popularity of the

 The small-scale private enterprise - which forms the majority of non-agrarian
 workforce in sub-Saharan Africa - receives very little governmental assistance

re to industry).
 In our view, the flight to urban areas is not merely an escape from despondent
 circumstances but the also the access to expanded consumption basket and
 a chance for improbable social mobilities.
 The introduction of industrial goods and the status needs of the consumers
 is therefore relevant to the trend of urban migration in sub-Saharan Africa
 - the observation that the indigenes have recently displaced non-indigenes
 or the more educated have replaced the less educated in conventional occupation
s in many sub-Saharan African countries may very well have a detectable
 impact on status consumption.

While the data on social identity was not available for this study, we use

 A study of the consumption in South Africa by Kaus chose a basket of products
 as close as possible to that in the Charles et al study

The need for a survey to measure visibility of items in the basket is however
 necessary when conducting similar studies in the developing countries

 ask two key questions to respondents in an online survey conducted in India.
 First asked them how closely they needed to interact with their neighbour
 (with similar demographic characteristics) in order to observe above average
 spending for a list of items (Options were -‘1: No Interaction’, ‘2: Occasional
 Interaction’, ‘3: Friend’, ‘4: Close Friend’ or ‘5: No matter how much
 one Interacts’).
 An item where >20% respondents report 1 or 2 was considered a visible item.
 A second question asked them what they'll expect of the consumption of
 an item after a sudden 20 percent rise in their neighbor's income ‘1: Fall’,
 ‘2: Stay the same’, ‘3: Increase by less than 20 percent’, ‘4: Increase
 by 20 percent’ or ‘5: Increase by more than 20 percent’.
 The list of items in these questions attempted to match the consumption
 categories in the IHDS.
 An item is associated with higher income if more than 20% of respondents
 reported 2,3,4 or 5.

 Visibility is a socio-cultural judgment - and the visibility basket from
 the developed world cannot be translated as such into disparate geographies
 and cultural environments of the developing world.
 One can in fact arrive at wrong conclusions on visible consumption for
 a consumer group if a visibility basket was chosen from a different cultural
 environment.
 For example, hair-products may be associated with a higher visibility (and
 promise) in the developed world but in the developing world their purpose
 could be just utilitarian (poor quality of production, cultural factors
 etc.).
 Attributing lower visible consumption based on a low consumption of hair-produc
ts would thus be erroneous.

Another practical problem arises in the developing world because of the
 predominant use of recall method in expenditure survey.
 A relevant anomaly is the Deaton Paxson paradox(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonPaxsonParadox"

\end_inset

) - i.e.
 the observed decrease in food expenditure per head as household size rises
 (with constant total outlay per head).
 The likely cause for the paradox is presence of errors correlated with
 household size in the data that results in possible overestimation of the
 consumption of recalled items
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonDeatonPaxson"

\end_inset

.
 Caution must therefore be taken (or a correction applied) when mixing expenditu
res from recall and diary methods.

While the visibility elasticities may not be compared across countries without
 above considerations but a comparison within the country can provide insights
 into the effect of certain demographic factors on visible consumption.
 This has been the central theme for most of the studies surveyed in this
 note.
 More than to improve the measurement of visibility, the studies are interested
 in identifying the demographic parameters that explain the log-expenditure
 of visibility basket as is.
 The general regression equation for such a study is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (accumulated over the chosen visibility basket), 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure.
 Households with higher total expenditure are far more likely to be those
 with higher visible expenditure.
 Thus, total expenditure (on the right side of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lnvis_regression-1"

\end_inset

) makes it an endogenous variable for the dependent variable : 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(vis_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 A different approach is taken by Jaikumar et al who use weights in the
 basket rather than visible expenditure levels - so that visible expenditure
 is not subject to the endogeneity problem that arises due to total expenditure
 being on the right hand side and visible expenditure on left hand side
 of the equation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"

\end_inset

 (The proportion of visible expenditure with respect to the total expenditure
 could be the same for those with higher total expenditure and lower total
 expenditure).
 However, since data on income is often poor or sparse in the developing
 countries, total expenditure turns out to be the most frequent choice for
 a proxy of permanent income (
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a key control parameter for the analysis of visible consumption).
 In most of the studies, the said endogeneity of total expenditure is resolved
 by a choice of appropriate instruments - e.g.
 income, cubic-income, positive-income dummies or occupation codes.
 These instruments identified by Charles et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

 are reported to be quite strong in the studies surveyed as part of this
 note (Sargan and Wu-Hausman tests confirm endogeneity and the effectiveness
 of chosen instruments).

 corresponding (permanent) income elasticities better.
 This observation has provided the basis for inspection of visible consumption
 in many studies thereforth.
 In an environment of inequalities, however, it is likely that i) the items
 available to higher status individuals may never be accessible to lower
 status individuals and ii) the individuals with perceived higher status
 may notice items differently from how the lower status individuals might
 notice them.
 The social factors thus relevant for the difference in visible preferences
 are sought in the studies on conspicuous consumption in the developing
 countries.
 In India, these factors are religion and caste - while in South Africa
 and United States, race seems to have significance.
 The developing countries may also offer a less consumerist and less individuali
stic agrarian environment where mundane and seemingly unvaried expenditures
 (lesser number of status items) are more visible than in a relatively more
 individualistic and industrialized society.

 therefore perform a slightly more detailed survey by asking what an individual
 whose consumption is noticed would do when her income rises (by 20%).
 This quantifies the expectation of how others infer the increases in total
 expenditure (income).
 The items where consumers expect the consumption to rise with increased
 income are those that associate with higher income and are declared

In a developing economy, the criterion for status consumption is clearly
 not just noticeability any more.
 Visible consumption does detail the mechanics of status competitions in
 a narrower sense where consumers participate in a market to increase their
 perceived status - but it does not provide an adequate picture of status
 consumption.
 One reason why other factors dominate is that markets are underdeveloped
 in the developing world and social status is largely yielded through sever-inco
me differences and social strata.
 The second and probably more significant reason is that status signaling
 does not exist in a society as an inherent need for visible appeal amongst
 humans.
 Instead visible consumption matters because the item in consideration is
 associated with higher status (in the same sense that Veblen had talked
 about in his 19th century treatise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interpretation of visibility as status consumption is therefore essential
 to conspicuous consumption.
 Veblen's assertion that conspicuous goods are essentially futile can be
 quite helpful in ensuring the separability of the visible/status utility.
 By assuming that a visible (or conspicuous) good serves no utility other
 than of status, we can be sure that the item in consideration does not
 have any utilitarian value and combine all the products to talk about the
 status benefit that the consumer receives (see Corneo et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

).
 The separability criterion unfortunately is not observed in all the literature
 around conspicuous consumption.
 While it may be convincing to argue that watches and make-up don't serve
 any utility other than status, it is very difficult to argue that housing
 or shoes offer only status benefits.
 If the assumption of conspicuous goods being completely futile (from a
 utilitarian perspective) is relieved, then combining the consumption on
 identified visible goods as conspicuous consumption (as has been done in
 some of the literature) is problematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We adopt the view that consumers don't buy an item purely for status needs
 - more so when the item is a bandwagon item such as a car or an electronics
 item.
 Inspired by Hirsch's idea of scarcity
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"

\end_inset

, we argue that status and scarcity of items must go hand in hand.
 So instead of limiting ourselves to visible consumption as the particular
 mechanics of status signaling - where consumers buy items in a common market
 and (presumably) over-weigh on items that are more noticeable - we attempt
 to understand how reasons such as unavailability of items and disparities
 of services across regions influence the needs of consumers and thus consumptio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
This is not to discount a study of visible consumption or the importance
 of a visibility survey in any way.
 In fact, visible consumption that affects status competitions encompasses
 more than just scarcity - our contention is only that the relevance of
 economic differences in status consumption should not be ignored in a study
 on conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
While we have expressed scarcity as a key idea in the explanations so far,
 we must admit that the idea of scarcity does lend itself to some confusion
 as it encompasses both a so-called physical scarcity (unavailability) and
 the perceived scarcity (what we feel as scarce).
 A consumer may feel that the item is scarce because she cannot afford it
 or because the supply of the item is limited through some other mechanism
 (i.e.
 barriers exist in the distribution of the item).
  The perceptions of quality of life are therefore metrics that cannot be
 measured easily -whether through consumption or through a survey.
 While such felt scarcities appear relevant for consumption, we consider
 felt scarcities only as long as they arise out of a relevant physical scarcity.
 Instead of attempting to define or measure felt scarcities themselves (as
 is done in a survey), we expand the notion of the physical scarcity to
 include barriers created through status competitions, advertising or other
 social-psychological communication that create the sense of urgent demand
 for a status-carrying good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The methods to quantify the barriers to status - artificial or social -
 are viewed as a probabilistic concern in time-series model and is discussed
 later in the study.
 The essential idea behind this view is that a commodity can indicate status
 through either being a snob type (where it has already been associated
 with high-status individuals in the past) or by being a bandwagon type
 item (where there is a clear competition to achieve a new item) 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If everybody has a certain item, then consumers may not consider it so important
 to acquire the item (since everyone else already has it) whereas for other
 types of item, consumers may rush to the item solely because there is a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To gauge status-related consumption one can either split the consumer basket
 into positional and non-positional items (as is done in most of empirical
 work) or assign a status-utility to every commodity in the basket.
 For reasons discussed in the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:ScarcityStatus"

\end_inset

, we choose the latter option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consequence of assigning status carrying power to all items in the model
 is that the status utility can no longer be viewed as separable overall
 from the non-status part of utility (there are no purely status goods any
 more).
 In this preliminary model, which we use for our empirical work, the consumer
 utility is considered separable across functional groups such as food,
 energy, entertainment etc.
 in the usual sense - and the status items are chosen by the consumer within
 each category instead of as a separate category.
 In the two-state budgeting model we use for the separable functional groups,
 the representative consumer first allocates money to be spent for the different
 functional categories (food, energy, etc.) before deciding on status items
 within each category (in food, energy, entertainment etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We view snob and bandwagon items as not simply the two types of items that
 exist in the the market for a consumer but rather as two opposing mechanisms
 a consumer uses to indicate her status.
 If we could rank all consumers in a population based on their status, then
 an arbitrarily chosen consumer would like to choose a snob item to protect
 her position in the ranking and use a bandwagon item to promote herself
 in the ranking (we view snob and bandwagon items in this sense).
 For a representative consumer, the goal of protecting one's rank with a
 snob item is achieved by choosing the higher priced items in a category
 and the goal of advancing one's rank is achieved by acquiring an item that
 associates oneself to the someone who has a higher rank.
 We interpret the latter effect as the tendency to choose cheaper substitutes
 for an asset that is otherwise not affordable - hence the bandwagon sense
 of the choice.

\begin_layout Standard

price and status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To outline a simple model for how prices may respond to status differences,
 we consider that the status advantage of an item is dependent on the status
 of individuals who already have access to it (or would have easier access
 to it).
 A new entrant in the market is typically limited to exclusive social sections
 or is priced high enough to prevent lower income consumers from acquiring
 it - just the same way the other items are.
 To be more specific, let's assume that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 clusters in a society that are sorted by their income and asset ownership
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}>i_{2}>...>i_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 All 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 clusters observing the launch of a new product (e.g.
 a new phone category or a car) would result in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 cases where every case 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 corresponds to clusters with income rank lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{k}(0\le k\le n)$
\end_inset

 not having access to the new product
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The probability of each of these 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 cases can be empirically calibrated while considering the club-building
 power of the status item.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Further, an item imparts status by both limiting the item to one of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 clusters and improving status of individuals by letting consumers move
 to higher cluster by establishing ownership identities.
 In other words, the consumption of a status item - by definition either
 improves or protects the status position of the consumer.
 The two rather opposing behaviours of the status item are indeed what is
 described in the literature as snob and bandwagon types - the snob types
 protecting the status while bandwagon types improving it.
 We argue that not only would the market put a high price on the new entrant
 status item but would be often compelled to introduce substitutes of the
 new entrant if 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is low (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k\sim i_{n}$
\end_inset

).
 The introduction of a new item at price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 would enhance status by both pricing out some consumers and by encouraging
 some others to purchase the status item.
 Over time, lower price substitutes may reduce the impact of the snob advantage
 so that the status at any time is a combination of the asset/income hierarchies
 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}>i_{2}>...>i_{n}$
\end_inset

 as well as the consumption on the status item.
 One therefore needs to delineate how consumption transforms the existing
 cluster hierarchy over time in order to comment on stability of prices
 of status goods.
 This is attempted in a later section of the study.
 Without the consideration of how status may be transformed by consumption,
 we rely on affordability factor alone
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that budget ratios 
\begin_inset Formula $(q/x)$
\end_inset

 are not relevant to affordability factor metrics.
 This is because status determinants - assets and barriers - depend on total
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 if an item has multiple prices) rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}/x_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the status item for the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, even with this outline of a model, it is clear that our assumption
 of the market being able to fairly price the status implies that the status
 advantage does not just depend on the price differences alone but also
 on whether the status items let the consumer form an identity or club of
 its owners or not.
 This is because status consumption must result in real status advantages
 (i.e.
 the mobility to a higher status group) over a long period of time for it
 to justify the long-term price of the status item(s).
 This is made possible by the market being free to launch new products and
 open status items to wider sections of society - thus arriving at a long
 term equilibrium of the price of the status good.
 Once can also claim from this view that the old status hierarchies can
 stay the same if status goods are only produced to limit price differences
 within the cluster - thus explaining the commonly observed phenomenon that
 luxury products don't always benefit from reaching out to a wider audience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For further clarity, let's consider a simpler numerical example with high,
 middle, low classes and two variants being sold at prices 10,20 - which
 are accessible to high, middle (but not low) classes.
 If middle classes consume 10, high classes 20, then the affordability factor
 becomes {-20q,-10q,0} for {low,middle,high} classes.
 If a new commodity is introduced at price 15, then only the high class
 has access to it.
 If someone in high class or middle class switches to item at price 15 then
 the AF becomes -5q instead of 0,-10q respectively (if all high classes
 together move to the item priced 15 then the price 20 item would be out
 of the market and the AF would remain 0).
 Now if a new commodity in the same category is introduced at price 5 then
 everybody has access to it and the new distribution may be {-15q, -10q,
 0} (assuming the middle class and high class consume price 10 and price
 20 items respectively).
 The apparent 5q improvement for the lowest class might not translate to
 an actual status promotion in the long-run.
 Consumption may just increase for the new item but the status advantage
 may be minimal in the long-run.
 By the same argument, the status advantage may be significant in the short-run
 if the consumers have not had access to the item for a long time (forcing
 the market to bring new status items with higher price).
 The impact of consumption on status is a probabilistic concern which we
 visit later in the study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we decompose status into several functional categories in our model,
 we also need to detail how choices for status in every functional category
 combine into the final status utility.
 In the long-run, we argue that the representative consumer develops a preferenc
e order of functional groups - food may become less important than housing
 and personal products etc.
 (as is indeed observed by the literature on visible consumption).
 This makes up for three factors which determine status in our model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\series bold
Category rank
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that a consumer is quite stubborn about how much status she wants
 to get from every functional group (food, energy, housing) - an assumption
 which disallows switching between functional groups for status-utility.
 This assumption is also aligned with the literature on visible consumption
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 that notices consumers' significant response to visible category of items.
 The way we incorporate visible categories in our model does not suffer
 with measurement errors for a visibility index (as used by Heffetz

) - since we are not concerned with whether items within a functional group
 are more or less visible with respect to each other (e.g.
 shampoo vs body-oil).
 In other words, the functional categories - of food,energy, housing etc.
 - themselves may have an effective order of visibility - i.e.
 it matters whether clothes are visible as opposed to an investment policy
 - but a more specific order of visibility within a category - e.g.
 whether shampoo is more visible than body-oil is rather meaningless - in
 the framework of the model.
 In summary, we assume that the consumers don't compensate for reduced (increase
d) status consumption in a functional category when faced with the price
 rise (decline) of the items in the category they had chosen for status
 consumption

Affordability Factor - Price differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first factor is that of price differentiation - i.e.
 the way a consumer sets herself apart from others through selection of
 higher-priced items.
 The more the price differentiation exists within a functional category,
 higher is the likelihood for the consumers to indicate status through purchase
 of higher priced item.
 If markets of items are perfect and differences in status and prices both
 exist in an economy, then it is certain that those with higher purchasing
 power would attempt to maintain their status with the purchase of higher
 priced items.
 Wherever available, price serves as an indicator of whether an item can
 exhibit any status or not.
 The lack of detailed price information in a survey (and/or unsuitability
 of using prices inferred from cost-quantity due to severe measurement errors

In absence of observed prices

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{B}/q_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Relying on total quantity (
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

) consumed of an item or the expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $(e=q\cdot p)$
\end_inset

 on the item does not serve as metric of status carrying potential as it
 can obfuscate the sense of status consumption.
 If for example, a consumer accumulates cheaper varieties of the an item
 instead of accumulating the higher priced varieties of the item, the comparison
 of quantities would no longer provide an accurate representation of the
 status-related consumption.
 If the prices of an item are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}(where\ p_{1}>p_{2})$

\begin_inset Formula $e_{A}<e_{B})$
\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{A}<q_{B}$
\end_inset

, consumer B accumulates cheaper varieties of the item.
 If we don't observe 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}$
\end_inset

 directly but observe the total consumption on the item by 
\begin_inset Formula $A(=e_{A})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $e_{A}<e_{B}$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily imply that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 derives less status than 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

 by consuming the variants of the same item.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

) does present severe limitations to this measure - but one can inspect
 the distribution of usage of expensive options for a category of items
 to understand the how much status the representative consumer may derive
 with the choice for expensive items in a category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given our earlier discussion on scarcity, we must clarify that rareness
 alone does not contribute much in determining status.
 For example, maternity products or musical instruments would always be
 limited to a certain section of the population - they become a status product
 
\shape italic
only
\shape default
 if there are low-price substitutes that exist for them.
 Therefore, an item's low distribution counts towards status only as long
 as it can be viewed as superior to other substitutes (through price if
 the markets exist for the category).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that participation of consumers in the same market is key in
 the view of affordability factor.
 Certain items may have higher price varieties due to transport costs -
 so if the markets where consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 participate are affected by different supply-side issues then it would
 be erroneous to consider status differences on grounds of price differences
 observed by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 All supply-side issues are to be considered as barriers to status (which
 can either improve or affect status) - i.e.
 being in a region, neighborhood or social network where certain commodities
 are exclusively available, a consumer may be imparted status advantage
 (or disadvantage).
 It makes sense therefore to think of the gain (loss) of status by being
 in a region where more items are available (unavailable).
 When comparing two consumers in different areas 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 where a commodity is both available and consumed in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 (but not in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

), the status impact of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 should adjust the measure of affordability factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue of availability is particularly relevant in the developing countries
 since the rural areas are faced with unavailability of services and goods

.
 In the data from Tanzania, for example, we find not only that the region
 dummies are significant in consumption of certain items in the survey (particul
arly with respect to such as electricity which is completely unavailable
 in large parts of the country), but the availability of electricity seems
 to transform the income elasticities of demand for other expenditures as
 well (e.g.
 marriage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Asset ownership
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than projecting their status through higher priced items, but consumers
 also wish to associate themselves to those who they perceive to have a

 Acquiring long-term assets are surest way to ascertain one's status in
 society
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The definition of asset is driven by consumer's intent of permanent ownership.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For others to associate with such asset owners, the consumers are likely
 to own what they may fit within their budget.
 Despite the same monthly expenditure, for example, rented housing for the
 same cost may carry more status simply because the houses that are less
 affordable to own can be made affordable by offering as rental housing.
 This is equivalent to the earlier problem of market forces presenting the
 consumer with cheaper substitutes - in the sense that the consumer doesn't
 need to own the item (not having to pay the full-price of the item desired)
 but is able to signal more status than otherwise by simply renting the
 item instead of owning a less expensive house.
 In general, wherever posed with the choice between owning and consuming
 the same item, the consumers may prefer to fulfill short-term status needs
 (in hope of future mobility) instead of owning either a high-price asset
 (which would require saving until a longer time) or a lower-priced asset
 (which would have significantly lower status advantage).
 This is simply because the markets may address status needs sooner than
 they address long-term needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to this tendency of the consumer, the status utility from monthly expenditur
e and that from owning assets are not independent of one another.
 Firstly, there are many items for monthly consumption that are either closely
 related or are substitutes of the corresponding owned assets.
 The status utility from electricity in a developing country, for example,
 would be achieved not only by having access to electricity but also (and
 more so) by running other appliances that depend on electricity.
 More expenditure on electricity itself doesn't derive any status - which
 is instead derived by usage of owned or rented assets that use electricity.
 The status utility (or ranking) from monthly expenditure therefore depends
 very much on the related assets in such a case.
 In case of mortgages, as another example, the boundary between asset ownership
 and monthly expenditure itself isn't very clear.
 The status utility from assets and consumption are therefore deemed not
 separable in our model of status utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The emergence of new commodities is worth commenting on in light of the
 affordability factor we've defined.
 A new commodity that is not traditionally guarded by social networks may
 appear to change old barriers to status - particularly when deeper economic
 changes take place.
 Electronic goods, cars, education or media could fall under this category
 of items.
 Based on our assumptions so far, the status advantage of a new commodity
 should also be explained by the affordability factor ( i.e.
 the commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}-max(p_{k})\cdot q$
\end_inset

).
 If the market is assumed to be able to price a status commodity fairly
 (i.e.
 the new items introduced would have a price reflecting their status advantage),
 then we may treat the new entrant as a higher priced variety of an existing
 item category
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that if the consumer cannot access the item then the status advantage
 is simply
\begin_inset Formula $-max(p_{k})\cdot q$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It may however be a strong assumption for empirical work that the prices
 of status goods at any time accurately represent the status benefits of
 the new item or in other words, status is priced fairly in the market at
 all times 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another practical consideration for affordability factor is the requirement
 that the old categories of items be generic enough for us to accommodate
 a new item as a higher price variant of a category.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In reality, it may take years for a new entrant item to develop into a
 status product which then would be subject to price changes as well as
 introduction of further new variants (possibly of lower quality to let
 consumers more subscribe to the item).
 The equilibrium price would be one where lower income individuals are priced
 out of an item whose selling price can no longer be lowered further with
 innovation.
 Except at this long-term equilibrium, the prices cannot be considered as
 an accurate representation of status.
 We may get away with some of such problems by viewing prices as exogenous
 - but one still needs to understand how prices evolve in response to status
 differences in society and how status consumption reflects status differences
 in the long-run.

The consumption of a lot status items could be dependent on each other -

\end_inset

 if the consumption on

\begin_inset Formula $B$

 For example, the status disadvantage from not consuming electricity may
 include the disadvantage of not having AC, stereo speakers etc.
 Fortunately, if we use a standardized basket for comparing consumption
 amongst individuals, the affordability factor would already sum up the
 disadvantages from all items that depend on a certain  item - a consumer
 not having access to electricity would also be disadvantaged by not having
 access to stereo equipment, TV, AC etc.
 In other words, when the consumers in an area don't have access to electricity,
 they lose collectively in the status hierarchy by being residents of the
 region.
 This approach can be used to understand the affect of personal characteristics
 on status e.g.
 residence locality and education etc.

The classification of an item into wide categories is not always obvious.
 An evident ambiguity arises when the item in consideration performs two
 functions e.g.
 a musical instrument can be classified either as an appliance or a personal
 product.
 As the latter category is a more visible category than the former, the
 classification of the item into either of the categories would require
 an understanding of the social context of the item's usage.
 We classify asset based on intent of ownership - hence a lot of items that
 are to be temporarily owned can be classified as non-assets.

 The cost of an item does matter it's cheaper than a toilet roll (we already

 The status utility - depends on both the group dimension and the category-price
 dimension.
 let's say then it cannot be of potential status value.
 When the tests are applied on carpetsrugs, on the other hand, their category
 can be in household product (not expendable unlike detergents) or housing

A preliminary analysis of budget ratios

There is always a temptation to think of an average total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 so that an expensive product (and therefore a status product) is simply
 one with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}>\gamma x_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 represents a threshold proportion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, if we want to consider any item that costs more than half
 of the total expenditure of 80% of a population, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 to be the 80% quantile of the total expenditures in the population and
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0.5$
\end_inset

.
 While 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 does provide us the items that are more expensive for most people - such
 products are not necessarily status products.
 In fact, the average (or median) of quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}/x$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the average budget ratio of all items is an equivalent measure.
 As discussed previously in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:precentile_threshold_method"

\end_inset

, items thus identified are not necessarily status items - but simply the
 less affordable items that we may consider as those with status carrying
 potential.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The differences between amounts spent by the lowest and higher percentile
 of spenders of a particular commodity are expected to be higher when a
 commodity is a status-good than when it is of common utility.
 The illustrations show non-zero log-level expenditure on a few commodities
 when the lower (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

) percentile of the consumption of the commodity is ignored.
 Ignoring the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile of the consumption of a visible commodity is equivalent to treating
 the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile expenditure as non-visible consumption (If we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=10\%$
\end_inset

 for electricity, then bottom 10% percentile of the consumption on electricity
 would be considered non-visible and anything above that level would be
 considered visible).
 The plots of log-expenditures are shown with rising 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (starting with the lowest percentile 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to lowest non-zero log-level of consumption of the commodity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
For a good that is not status-related, one expects that the consumers from
 lower and higher quantiles of total expenditure (x-axis) would consume
 similar amounts of the good (y-axis).
 For a positional good, the consumers spending higher expenditure on the
 good would lean towards consumers with higher total expenditure.
 This does not indicate signaling in any way - but tests only whether a
 commodity is consumed uniformly amongst those with lower and higher total
 expenditure outlays (this is rather a measure of scarcity of the item than
 of its visibility).
 Choosing different thresholds (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta)$
\end_inset

 provides a a control on the degree to which a certain commodity can be
 included in a supposed conspicuous consumption basket.
 Instead of asking whether marriage spending is visible or not - for example
 - the test asks if only the richer consumers can afford a significant expenditu
re on marriage (while varying the degree of visibility attached to spending
 on marriage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In the data from Tanzania, while top 56% of consumers show spending on rice,
 electricity appears to be a luxury when only top 22 % of consumers spend
 on it.
 This does not necessitate that a higher consumption of electricity indicates
 higher status but a higher threshold for electricity certainly indicates
 its physical scarcity which may permit status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A similar analysis of Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) data from the US
 in years 2004,2010 and 2014 similarly shows clear differences between expenditu
re on jewelry and fruits.
 It is evident that jewelry is not popular amidst the relatively poor and
 that richer consumers spend a higher portion of their total expenditure
 on jewelry than on fruits (curve being steeper for jewelry).
 While we don't use this disparity in the classification of status, we expect
 the observed phenomena to be explained by affordability factor measurements.

\begin_layout Subsection
Identification of items for status consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A general regression model to understand the consumption on status items
 can be written as the following:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
s & =\beta_{1}\phi(\sum_{i\in B}q_{i},\boldsymbol{q})+\beta_{2}z+\epsilon\label{eq:main_regression}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the relevant consumption measure for the identified consumption categories
 where status consumption is possible
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We differentiate between a category where status consumption is possible
 (through higher expenditure) from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 category of commodities whose purchase indicates status.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the consumption on an item 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (
\series bold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{q}$
\end_inset


\series default
 being the vector of quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 ) in the basket 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is a function and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 denotes the household characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:main_regression"

\end_inset

 can only represent consumption items whose total costs can be added up
 to the dependent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 As we neither have the cost for assets owned nor the quantities of any
 non-food expenditure item, the ratio of how much a consumer buys as assets
 to how much she expends on non-durable items cannot be measured for the
 above model.
 LSMS does however record the total number of assets owned by a household.
 Thus we use an asset-ownership score as a control variable in the Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:main_regression"

\end_inset

 - calculated using by binary flags of different assets owned.
 For example, if we were to measure asset scores for items 
\begin_inset Formula $\{Land,TV,Iron\}$
\end_inset

, then a consumer who owns just an iron has a score 1(
\begin_inset Formula $1\times2^{0}=1$
\end_inset

), one who owns just a TV has 
\begin_inset Formula $2(0\times2^{0}+1\times2^{1})$
\end_inset

 and one who owns all the assets has the score 7 
\begin_inset Formula $(1\times2^{0}+1\times2^{1}+1\times2^{2})$
\end_inset

 .
 The asset control variable thus obtained can help determine whether asset
 ownership changes consumption on items in 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume separability of utility into categories energy, food, personal
 care, social functions and land-ownership - hence the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:main_regression"

\end_inset

 must be viewed as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
s_{c\in\mathscr{C}} & =\beta_{1,c\in\mathscr{C}}\phi_{c}(\sum_{i\in B}q_{i},\boldsymbol{q})+\beta_{2,c\in\mathscr{C}}z+\epsilon
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{C}$
\end_inset

 is the set of categories encompassing a category 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 To reiterate, we avoid viewing a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

status category
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:main_regression"

\end_inset

 because of our claim that amongst available items to buy, a consumer does
 not look for a status item per se (much less so in the developing countries
 where status is derived mostly from assets owned and quality of consumption)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact even in the developed countries, a survey can hardly rank high-quality
 food-consumption lower or higher than ownership of a sports-watch on a
 visibility or status scale.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another simplification of the above model is through the assumption that
 visibility does not to matter at a level finer than the broad consumption
 categories of food, energy, transport, personal care, social functions
 and housing.
 Therefore, while a consumer may find food consumption less visible overall
 than energy, we don't recognise a difference in visibility between mangoes
 and spam as relevant for status utility to the consumer.
 The differences in price and in perceived quality-of-life between consuming
 these two options are what motivate the consumer - not the sense of visibility.
 These factors are measured with the price differences within the items
 in a category and the substitution between consumption and assets for similar
 needs.
 The Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:status_dimensions"

\end_inset

 details this view of status consumption
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that education - which is acquired over long-term - is viewed as
 an asset.
 Notice also that we consider it impossible to overspend on public transport
 to substitute for not owning a car.
 Hence there is no status advantage derived by overspending on public transport
 as consumption.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As shown in the table, visibility has no role to play other than the weight
 consumers collectively put on the widely defined categories of food, energy,
 personal care, social functions, transport and housing.
 The consumers differentiate themselves from others in their social surrounding
 by buying more newer, higher priced items as well as overspending on consumptio
n categories that help them remain in the asset ownership club (the latter
 being the justification of consumption remaining in the same functional
 category).

\begin_layout Standard
A clear limitation of the model is that even though our assumption of separabili
ty of categories of consumpation does not permit so, a consumer may overspend
 on more than one categories two compensate for another.
 In other words, a consumer who doesn't own a house may overspend on both
 carpets and weddings - even though this behaviour goes against our assumption
 of separability of these categories.
 In other words, separability of expenditure does not necessarily imply
 separability of asset ownership across the categories.
 However, as we do assume separability of categories in our current context,
 a one-to-one relation between the category of assets and the corresponding
 consumption category - which the consumer may overspend on - does follow
 as a consequence.

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If there are

 individuals with

 sources of income each, then it is safe to assume that workers in the same
 region and same employment-type have reasonably similar incomes.
 The variance in incomes recorded for the same local group can give an estimate
 of how noisy the data is due to self-reporting.

 Given the sparsity of available income data, however, instruments for age

.
 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{skincreamconsu}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that
 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.

 no-primary-job getting a significant income from their secondary occupations
 makes the task of associating the primary occupation of the household head
 with her income rather difficult (i.e.
 occupation - which is available for all household heads cannot be used
 as a proxy of household income - which is not available for all households
 in the survey).
 Grouping the occupations into fewer categories than in the survey (by putting
 paid/unpaid family work and agriculture under the same category for example)
 allows for the smoothening of the effect of individual occupations and
 may serve as a proxy of socioeconomic classes in the country.
 Without or without this grouping, the effect of occupation has been found
 significant on the consumption of scarce commodities.

Effect of Education Level

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
One of the claims to be evaluated on the LSMS data is whether education
 has a significant correlation with consumption on status items.
 If the education level of NA is considered as none (for nearly 30% of the
 recorded individuals), then highest education level of the household held
 is found quite significant for many commodities.

Effect of Immigration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
With a significant migration from rural areas, one of the claims to be tested
 is whether those resident in the community spend less on positional consumption.
 While this does seem be to be a significant factor, it has a weaker effect
 than age or household size (which is to be further split as number of children
 and the number of members minus the number of children) .

If one were to use a dummy for accessible markets (created using the distance
 from the surveyed household location to the closest daily market ) - the
 effect of such a dummy is not so significant on positional consumption.
 The region dummies - on the other hand - are found to have more significance
 - indicating regional disparities for conspicuous consumption in the country.

Population density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Population density is a crude measure for crowding in the cities.
 The regions with higher population density do have a slight effect on consumpti
on of scarce commodities.
 It is hoped that a urban/rural dummy created by classifying districts based
 on their population densities (or at a finer granularity than regional
 levels) may give a more detailed view on the effect of population density
 on status-related consumption.

Household size

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of a spatially or economically excluded area with denser urban
 areas provides further insights on status competitions.
 Testing whether the proxies of social interaction (family members etc.)
 have an impact on status-related consumption or not, we find there are
 many products that seem likely to have signaling effects but for which
 the number of family members is not statistically significant.

Services as Visible Consumption

\begin_layout Standard

One of the interesting observations in the Vindex survey (Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) is the clustering of services and products.
 It is found that services tend to be less 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the Western consumer world.
 The clustering might not be as clear-cut in the developing world - where
 social stratification is severe and many services are contractual (non-monetary
).
 The socio-cultural barriers might have an effect through access to services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Towards that claim, English education as a control parameter is found quite
 significant for positional consumption.
 Those who identify themselves as English speakers tend to spend more on
 scarce commodities.
 This indicates that English education may be quite scarce - and while it
 isn't reflected in the consumer expenditure market data so easily - it's
 likely to play a role in status competitions.

While a commodity for private consumption (e.g.
 skin-cream or hobby-equipment in the LSMS data) might have an appeal for
 everyone - whether it signals high-status or not is a social psychological
 concern and cannot be assessed from the household survey by itself.
 In the absence of a visibility survey (asking the respondents how much
 they notice a product and whether they associate the product with high-income
 or not), one may still continue the discussion of the potential conspicuous
 value of items by looking at how scarce the item is (based on the percentile
 of consumers of the commodity).
 This is akin to repeating the analysis of visible expenditure with a given
 commodity as the only constituent of the visibility basket.
 For reasons discussed in the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:ScarcityStatus"

\end_inset

, we avoid combining the consumption on status items to interpret status-related
 consumption.
 The percentile of consumers using a given commodity (e.g.
 top 22% for electricity) and the slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(commodity-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $log(total-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 tells us if richer sections of society spend more on a certain commodity
 and if the poorer sections of society consume the chosen commodity at all
 (the commodities chosen in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 are those where this slope is significant).
 The regression based on data prepared from the last step attempts to calculate
 the coefficients of the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression-2}

\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$

 summarize the results obtained by running regressions on several commodity-cate

 A column in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 also suggests the percentile of consumers using the commodity (electricity
 for example is used amongst those having top 22% of total expenditure).
 The usage of commodities such as skincream and other-personal-products
 (shampoos, razors etc.) are widespread compared with sports or hobby equipment
 and electricity.
 For commodities that are rare and consumed only amongst the richer sections
 of the society (those with higher total expenditure) the effect of English
 literacy is significant.
 Similarly, hsize has a significant effect on both educational expense and
 personal products (using number of children instead of hsize could provide
 better association with education expense).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
We cannot claim from the results that the population spends more on status
 commodities than on education.
 What we can claim however, is that electricity is more scarce than education.
 Further, in areas where food is expensive, spending on marriage reduces
 - particularly by the occupations that may bring higher incomes.
 This marks a preference towards industrial goods in the urban (expensive)
 areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Another observation that presents an opportunity to combine status needs
 is that the scarcity of items occurs in clusters of objects.
 Carpets-rugs require a certain housing status and access to English depends
 on region.
 Similarly, many hobby equipment may require access to electricity etc.
 The clustering of these items essentially point to the urban-rural differences
 in the country.
 We also find that the prices can be significantly different between regions.
 The dummies

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
If consumption pressures are explained by the level of urbanization, population
 density and interaction (family members etc.) then we can better understand
 what drives conspicuous consumption - addressing which can relieve on urban
 migration pressures and help reduce the size of informal sectors.

Much of the literature surveyed in the study has viewed conspicuous consumption
 as visible consumption where the wastefulness of consumption by participants
 is a core concern.
 In the works of Ireland

 and Arrow, Dasgputa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and elsewhere, conspicuous consumption is seen as a difference between
 social welfare and market equilibrium.
 Of particular interest is the model of status-signaling provided by Ireland
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 where consumers attempt to maximise a combined utility of visible (public)
 and non-visible (private) consumption
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The utility function is modeled as 
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)f(v,w)+af(\hat{v},\hat{w})$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{v},\hat{w}$
\end_inset

 are societies' view of the consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $a(>0)$
\end_inset

 is a parameter indicating how much visible consumption matters to the consumer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The model is of remarkable simplicity but calibrating it involves a sensitivity
-parameter of how much visible consumption matters to the consumers.
 Given the nature of status competitions in society, such a calibration
 is hardly trivial.
 A study by Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 using this model involved surveying a few hundreds of respondents asking
 them - quite literally - just how visible every item is for a typical consumer

The choice of visible and non-visible goods matters more in developing markets
 where a culture of mass consumerism is only nascent and status competitions
 aren't driven by economic inequalities alone (whereas in developed markets,
 firms are quick to turn a conspicuous item into a higher-priced commodity).
 The context of exploits identified by Veblen is however still relevant
 in the developing markets

 differs significantly between social classes

Status differences and Conspicuous consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
We find the role of perceived status differences more general and relevant
 to conspicuous consumption ins societies.
 As argued before, the role of conspicuous consumption is to signal a higher
 status.
 The need for conspicuous consumption is shaped by the owned assets as well
 as lack of availability of items (particularly in a developing country).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand the relation between status differences and consumption, we
 note that the concept of status has characteristics of a feedback system
 in the long-run i.e.
 status may yield income and more assets through established social barriers
 but status itself often requires income and assets to be acquired.
 We therefore view status as a combination of the assets and the barriers
 to acquiring the assets.
 The Ireland model - popular in the literature - treats status consumption
 in a slightly different manner.
 The model views status-signaling as comprising of visible and non-visible
 goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

 - where the combined utility for every consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $U=F(f(v,w),s)$
\end_inset

 - 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)$
\end_inset

 being the private utility of the consumer and status 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 being an increasing function of inference of others.
 The status inference function is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $s=f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) where 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 denotes visual consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 - the consumption that is not directly observable.
 Every consumer optimizes the combined private and visible utility.
 A practical consideration in the model is the separation between visible
 and non-visible consumption - a boundary that requires a socio-cultural
 judgment and has been drawn using consumer surveys in the literature.
 This separation is key to additivity assumption which is at the heart of
 the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The parameter of combined utility in a simplified model - (
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)\cdot f(v,w)+a\cdot f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - can vary for different sections of society in the developing world.
 A view of status hierarchies is thus relevant in the developing world where
 status is often yielded through social barriers.
 We then attempt to connect these identify how these social characteristic
 may relate to conspicuous consumption in the long-run.
 For example, English literacy seems to have correlation with the consumption
 of certain scarce products in Tanzania.
 In the model of scarcity, English literacy (along with urban residence
 and other characteristics significant for consumption of scarce commodities)
 would be seen as a status good that is acquired through spending on education
 or migration (or other relevant commodities).

Notice that one needs to be careful while drawing conclusions based on consumpti
on of commodities that are themselves selected based on the percentiles
 of consumption levels.
 We cannot select items that the only richer section of society indulges
 in and claim that people spending on these selected items indicate higher
 status.
 Such a claim is only a restatement of the high permanent income and says
 nothing more substantial than that the richer population sections signal
 higher status.
 It would be a fallacy to associate visible consumption with household character
istics by only associating household characteristics with permanent income.
 The interpretation status in terms of the asset ownership and the barriers
 in society that exist to acquiring these assets - avoids such circular
 notions of status or conspicuous consumption.

Linear Budget Constraint - General restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The linear-budget in the demand theory poses some constraints on the demand
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x,p)$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the quantity demanded, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the total expenditure and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the vector of prices).
 The key budget constraints are the homogeneity constraint (
\begin_inset Formula $q(\theta x,\theta p)=\theta q(x,p)$
\end_inset

) and the adding-up constraint (
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma p_{k}q_{k}=x)$
\end_inset

.
 The adding-up constraint is often written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma p_{k}\frac{\partial q_{k}}{\partial x}=1;\ \Sigma p_{k}\frac{\partial g_{k}}{\partial p_{i}}=-q_{i}$
\end_inset

 (for a good 
\begin_inset Formula $i\epsilon[1,n]$
\end_inset

) while the homogeneity restriction as: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{k}\frac{p_{k}}{q_{i}}\frac{\partial q_{i}}{\partial p_{k}}-x\frac{\partial q_{i}}{\partial x}=0$
\end_inset

These theoretical constraints aren't automatically true for empirical data.
 Instead, their validity needs to be tested.
 For example, in the Working-Leser model - which provides a simple demand
 function (as well as the corresponding Engel curve) with the budget share
 dependent on total expenditure alone ( 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\beta\cdot log\ x_{i}+\alpha$
\end_inset

 where total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

, budget share
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$

 are regression coefficients) - one needs to make sure that the adding-up
 and homogeneity restrictions apply on the data (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma\alpha_{i}=1$

\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma\beta_{i}=0$

 The measurement of differences in consumption of expensive and cheap varieties
 of a commodity was termed as the quality-coefficient (an intuition relevant
 to conspicuous consumption as well).

 the small-size families spend proportionately higher on expensive tea varieties

Shape of the utility curve - Particular Restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The restrictions of adding-up and homogeneity are often too general to provide
 any meaningful interpretation of utility.
 The empirical work therefore often involves further restrictions on the
 shape of utility curves.
 The most important property of the utility curve arises out of the revealed
 preference model - which assumes that for set of choices 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 may be 
\shape italic
always
\shape default
 preferred in presence of both 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, if 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 is 
\shape italic
revealed
\shape default
 as preferred to item 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 would be preferred to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 even if the consumer was compensated more.
 This was originally proposed by Samuelson and then extended to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 items by Houthakker.
 The demand functions ( 
\begin_inset Formula $q=g(x)$
\end_inset

 ) are well behaved when revealed preference applies - and lead to the Slutsky
 equations (that give us the matrix of substitution effects) - which can
 be summarised as the negative-semi-definiteness of the substitution matrix
 and the symmetry of cross-substitution effects

In the context of conspicuous consumption, the preferences are expected
 to be comparable and transitive.
 The axiom of revealed preference is also expected to hold i.e.
 when an item is revealed preferred to another item - then more income would
 continue to maintain that item preferred.
 Assuming any further restrictions on the utility curves may require a theoretic
al justification as well as the empirical tests associated with assumption
 of the shape of the utility curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

A commonly used restriction is that of separability.
 A convenient way to think of separability (and the necessary and sufficient
 conditions for it
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The necessary and sufficient condition for separability is the marginal
 rate of substitution between any two variables in the same group being
 independent of a variable in any other group.
\end_layout

\end_inset

) is to view it as a hierarchy of needs - i.e.
 a utility tree - where needs are split into multiple groups - each of which
 further expands into sub-groups which themselves eventually expand into
 individual items.
 Separability implies that the items in each group can be rearranged within
 the group by the consumer without affecting the items in other groups at
 the same level in the tree (except through the effect of the expenditure
 associated with the item on the total income).
 An aggregation of all groups moving upwards in the tree gives us the final
 utility - a process that is equivalent to the combination of sub-utility
 functions that each of the branch in the tree corresponds to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
When separability applies, the optimal utility problem amounts to optimising
 sub-utility functions i.e.
 the utility in each group.
 For every group 
\begin_inset Formula $r\epsilon G$
\end_inset

, the consumer is meant to optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u_{r},p_{r})=min[x=\sum q_{i}p_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{r}(x,p_{r})=u_{r}]$

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{r}$
\end_inset

 in these problems would be chosen subject to the combined utility function
 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{G}$

 being of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{G}(u_{G})\cdot b_{G}(u_{G})$
\end_inset

If conspicuous items were considered as a group, then separability of such
 a group from other groups of utility such as entertainment, education or
 even food may not be possible.
 This is because an item can be of both conspicuous and a more utilitarian
 value at the same time.
 The condition for an separable group - after all - is that a consumer can
 order the items within the group without considering an item outside the
 group (except through the effect of the item in the group to the consumer's
 total budget).
 In case of a group comprising of conspicuous items, a consumer can order
 items within the group of conspicuous items with considering any item outside
 the group (of non-conspicuous items) only if i) the difference between
 conspicuous and non-conspicuous items is clear and ii) all conspicuous
 items don't belong in any other group.
 In reality, all items reachable within the budget may be of some conspicuous
 value to the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To illustrate this idea, let's assume that we have only the following items
 in the consumer universe: cigarettes, cheap and expensive varieties of
 fruits and cinema.
 Signaling preference order for one consumer might be cigars
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

cinema
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

expensive fruits
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

 cheap fruits.
 The status needs may be fulfilled for the consumer by either expenditure
 on cinema or on cigar.
 Another consumer might be satisfied with expensive fruits for the status
 need.
 All consumers can achieve different statuses or signaling benefits from
 several items.
 Status is typically derived from a collection of items - the idea of every
 item imparting a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

signaling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 utility often makes little sense.
 To model the group of conspicuous items is to model the mechanism that
 indicates status - which is indicated by consumers trying to associate
 themselves to a richer (or high status) group of individuals through expenditur
e (this view of status consumption derives from the literature on snob and
 bandwagon items

\begin_inset Foot

Status isn't an ordinal concept.
 Further, it is even difficult to obtain a one-dimensional view of status
 - both education and watches can indicate status - of different kinds.
 It may be possible to model status as a configuration of top varieties
 of all other groups - an idea that too deviates from separability.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus the utility of a status good is bound to overlap with that of other
 goods - and the status items can be considered separable only if the visible
 items selected in the visible groups don't affect other groups at all (given
 the boundary of visible and non-visible items is clear).
 For our example, if somebody chooses cinema alone for visibility, then
 separability is achieved - whereas if one uses expensive potatoes and tomatoes
 for indicating status, then an overlap with food takes place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A stronger form of separability is additivity which is also ruled out for
 conspicuous items.
 However, if one can organize consumer universe in terms of non-conspicuous
 and conspicuous groups, strong separability (or even additivity) of groups
 can make sense (this is indeed used in the Ireland model

While consumption on certain items may provide interesting insights into
 the distribution of consumption items across regions in an economy, a conclusio
n on the status goods that relies on consumption microdata alone does not
 claim much about much about the perceptions of status per se.
 Our decision of what is a status good or not constitutes a certain implicit
 definition of status (not necessarily that of the customers).
 Both status differences in the society and the consumption related to it
 are social psychological constructs - and one can seldom claim that the
 real differences in assets or consumption alone cause or represent the
 perception of status differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if given the same levels of economic inequalities between two
 societies 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, one perceives the status differences differently from the other, it is
 hardly trivial to conclude from the consumption data alone that the status
 consumption is more important in one over the other.
 This is because what we consider a status good (or the status impact of
 a good) may differ significantly across the two societies - depending on
 largely socio-cultural factors.
 If status perceptions are not recorded in the consumption data, it is difficult
 to draw conclusions about status from the observed consumption data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To elaborate the point further - consider the design of a survey that records
 the perceptions of status across two disparate societies 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 In doing so, one has to level the perceptions between the two societies
 to a common standard e.g.
 by translating the survey questions in equivalent terms and metrics.
 Similarly, when we attempt to answer this question by observing the consumption
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, we would need a standardized basket to be compared between the consumers
 in the two societies.
 The task of standardization of the basket (equivalent to standardised linguisti
c and cultural constructs in the survey) has some inherent judgment on status
 measurement- since the standard basket itself is often decided by observing
 the average consumption on each item.
 This is not different from the circular definition problem discussed in
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:caution-against-circular-definition"

\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To resolve the issue of status perceptions determining what's a status good
 and the consumption on them contributing to status in turn, we require
 a clear feedback model for status - one that clarifies how status differences
 may affect both the definition of a status good (or the status impact of
 a good) and the consumption of the status good.
 Such a model must treat the perceptions of status and the economic determinants
 that drive status (in the long run) separately - since the two don't always
 move together.
 The model we develop in the next few subsections considers the assets,
 income and the barriers to achieving them as the economic determinants
 of status.
 The consumer then overweighs on the item that improve her perceived status
 in the hope of status mobility (whether it be in the long or short run).
 The speed with which these economic determinants are achieved or lost constitut
es the status of an individual at any given point.

Similar to the model provided by Corneo et al.

, we assume that status utility for a consumer corresponds to the ranking
 in a population of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 consumers.
 This ranking (or utility) can simply be 
\begin_inset Formula $r\epsilon(0,1)$
\end_inset

 - which is imparted by a combination of consumption vector 
\begin_inset Formula $c$

, assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 and personal characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 Since we don't just consider the items that are pure status goods and have
 no other utility, we view price differences as an essential measure of
 status impact.
 The utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 that every consumer optimises is thus a function of consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be 0), assets owned 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the personal characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 In societies 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 where the inequalities are the same, we can argue that if people in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 perceive less status differences than those in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, then they would get less status utility in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 from the same standardized vector 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 than when in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 - and thus would care less about status advantages from consumption when
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Our utility function includes the belief of the consumer in achieving absolute
 long-term advantages from a status good in terms of the economic determinants
 of status (i.e.
 consumption, assets and personal characteristics).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not necessarily to solve the model, one can decompose the status score 
\begin_inset Formula $r\epsilon(0,1)$
\end_inset

 yielded to an individual in terms of ranks (utilities) from consumption,
 assets and personal characteristics.
 Thus the rank 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 may be expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
r & =\phi(r_{C},r_{A},r_{\rho})\label{eq:separable_determinant_subutilities}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{C}$
\end_inset

 is the rank (or utility) obtained by consumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{A}$
\end_inset

 is rank derived from assets and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 is rank derived from personal characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 education, skills).
 We treat consumer's income only as a monetary asset in this model i.e.
 the income is not directly observed by other consumers.
 These three ranks represent the immediate status needs of the consumer
 - they are all what what a consumer may want while purchasing a status
 item.
 The consumer does not attempt change the personal characteristics or other
 barriers while consuming items or owning assets - since the barriers from
 personal characteristics are constant in the short-run.
 With these in mind, we can say that the societies 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the aforesaid example would have different functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 A further simplification may be possible, if above decomposition is assumed
 to be separable and additive (so that one can see what portion of budget
 is spent on which sub-utility).
 We postpone this simplification until the full specification of the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure that we have indeed resolved the circular definition problem with
 our formulation, notice that increasing consumption on existing status
 items or newer status items would attempt to level the differences in assets
 and therefore improve status (without changing the definition of status
 item instantaneously).
 This is because the rank of consumption may differ from rank of assets.
 We are able to measure status consumption in our framework as long as the
 consumer utility depends on the combined ranking of assets, personal characteri
stics and consumption.
 Thus the consumption on an item is never a criterion for it to be defined
 as a status good.
 Instead, the consumer's ranking is what drives the status impact of an
 item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the notion of status through ranking also allows us to address
 the physical vs social scarcity dilemma that we discussed earlier ( a terminolo
gy used by F.
 Hirsch ).
 The economic determinants may simply represent the physical scarcities
 while social scarcities can be measured with the probability of status
 promotion through consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible criticism of our current view of status is that we cannot be
 certain that some higher priced items are not used for reasons other than
 status.
 It could instead be that the people are just interested in new items, rare
 items or high quality items - not necessarily being cognizant or desirous
 of the status-bearing qualities of the purchased item.
 Since the essential goal of our definition of a status good is to present
 an ontological sense of status in terms of rare item and less achievable
 item, our counter-argument would simply be that status is constituted solely
 in the ability to materialise the concerns of quality, novelty or rareness
 (which too are often of subjective nature).
 Status is therefore constituted in such concerns - particularly as a reflection
 of the consumer's belief in a ranking in relation to others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

The notion of barrier and status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ranking of asset and consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $r_{C},r_{A}$
\end_inset

) in a population are trivially observable and a disparity between the ranking
 of consumption on items and the ranking of assets may even serve as a test
 of conspicuous consumption in societies.
 However,  since the signaling of status through consumption is also one
 of social mobility, we cannot truly agree with the Veblen's sense of conspicuou
s consumption being truly futile (an assumption that immensely simplifies
 the utility function).
 In our view, status is a record of the race for acquiring assets and security.
 Hence the notion of barriers to asset ownership is key to our view.
 Status is constituted not just in owning the assets but the relative positionin
g with respect to others who don't have the same assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measuring such a barrier to assets requires an understanding of how assets
 are distributed in society and how likely are those without the assets
 to acquire them over time.
 In real terms, the status of an individual is advanced trivially when she
 owns more assets.
 In the presence of barriers to asset ownership, if such acquisition of
 assets or introduction of newer groups of with assets is significant, then
 the barriers must change in response to the economic changes in order to
 grant status to the newcomers - since status is nothing more than access
 to and ownership of assets in our view.
 A simple way to understand this status barrier in a time-series formulation
 could be a threshold that rejects those with the combined values of asset,
 consumption and status-weight of personal characteristics lower than its
 value at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This threshold must also depend on the past value(s) of itself (i.e.
 threshold at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

) - since status has some momentum across time and the assets grow in the
 economy over time.
 An essential property of this barrier is also that it changes to maintain
 the boundaries between the status clusters
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is to be ensured through a choice of the utility functions rather than
 enforced boundary conditions.
\end_layout

 If we assume a linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 from personal characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 (or utility from personal characteristics), then the ranking (utility)
 could be written 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\rho_{t+1}}=\beta_{\rho,t+1}\rho_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\rho,t+1}$
\end_inset

 - the threshold - depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A threshold function of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is however neither observable nor even realistic.
 Its role here is only to illustrate how status clusters may be formed in
 a society.
 To find a more realistic representation of what drives the formation of
 status clusters - we look at the probability of a status promotion within
 clusters of a society so that the consumer purchases status goods with
 an expectation of a bump in her status.
 The barrier 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 would correspond to a mapping from consumption and assets onto the the
 net ranking of status of individuals such that those with lower assets
 consistently spiral into lower status and those with highest status keep
 or promote their status.
 Let's consider a three person simulation to describe the workings of this
 probabilistic model.
 Starting with three individuals (
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1},k_{2},k_{3})$
\end_inset

 and two clusters 
\begin_inset Formula $(s_{1},s_{2})$
\end_inset

 with personal characteristics, consumption and asset tuples as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1},c_{1}A_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{2},c_{2},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{3},c_{3},A_{3}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Further, let the initial conditions be 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}=A_{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}=c_{2}=c_{3}$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\rho_{1})=s(\rho_{2})=s(\rho_{3})$
\end_inset

 - so that statuses are the same for everyone in the beginning (i.e.
 there are no status clusters).
 In the next cycle, if the economy progresses in a way that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}>c_{2}(=c_{3})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}(=A_{3})$
\end_inset

 then in the subsequent cycle we'll have 
\begin_inset Formula $s(k_{1})>s(k_{2})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(k_{2})=s(k_{3})$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}\epsilon s_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2,},k_{3}\epsilon s_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This dissimilarity in status at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would also imply that the probability of gaining more assets and consuming
 more in the next cycle 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 would be higher for the individuals in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 than those in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, if we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}=c_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}>c_{3}$
\end_inset

in a subsequent cycle 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 then there is a chance that 
\begin_inset Formula $s(k_{1,t_{1}+1})=s(k_{2,t_{1}+1})$
\end_inset

 and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1},k_{2}\epsilon s_{1}$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{3}\epsilon s_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 There is also the chance that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}$
\end_inset

 might even start to carry more weight than 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

 for status.
 The number of clusters stay the same in our model so the consumption probabilit
ies would change in a way that the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{3}>c_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{3}>c_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the next cycle is extremely unlikely.
 While the iterations in the game outline the basic idea of the model, the
 formulation of the status function 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 requires further details for it to make empirical sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\size normal
A probabilistic model of status (under review)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We measure the status impact of the item with the differences in prices
 of the items consumed.
 This impact is known to the consumer in our model but what she doesn't
 know is whether consuming a status item would get her any real advantages
 in the long term.
 We assign a subjective probability as a measure for her motivation to purchase
 a status item and claim that the inference of status from consumption and
 asset ownership in the long-run is equivalent to the consumer's degree
 of confidence in promotion within status hierarchies.
 In other words, by believing that belonging to a certain status cluster
 (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1},s_{2}...$
\end_inset

) may improve her chances of economic success in future (asset ownership
 in the long run), the consumer believes simultaneously in a mobility through
 association with high-income consumption (along with asset ownership) and
 in the ability to improve her own image relative to others around her.
 The fulfillment of needs for local status competitions and a belief in
 mobility to a higher status cluster are therefore the same goals in this
 model (an assumption that is least problematic when the consumers are communica
ted of the consumer basket of the higher-income individuals through advertisemen
ts, common markets etc.).
 The scope of status competitions being more sensitive to local social contexts
 than the materialist potential benefits in the long-run provides the dynamics
 that we intend to model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While modeling consumer's utility across multiple time-periods in the intertempo
ral substitution problem therefore (more appropriately called the felicity
 function in literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonUnderstandingConsumption"

\end_inset

), we claim that the status goods don't just grow in value (at a constant
 interest-rate 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 or through the equity payments) but also increase the (subjective) probability
 of promotion to a higher perceived status level.
 This shapes the consumer's expectation of future income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that consumer's belief does not have a direct significance on the
 economic determinants of status itself - which are based strictly upon
 the distribution of assets/income (i.e.
 clusters of society based on the owned assets, consumption and income).
 The mechanics that we intend to model is how the notion of higher/lower
 status would develop for our representative consumer towards the individuals
 with higher assets which are clustered by region or other social characteristic
s.
 The belief in status and the confidence that is imparted by consuming goods
 owned by richer counterparts may have an indirect influence on distribution
 of assets through flocking, migration or other social choices but the consumpti
on itself doesn't directly create status (as per our definition).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach to status is different from its visible consumption scope,
 since we claim a belief in hierarchy lies at the heart of conspicuous consumpti
on.
 That a higher rate and chance of asset growth is guaranteed to a person
 of a certain characteristic tied with higher status is the core belief
 of a consumer who purchases status goods.
 The process of how the income of every individual evolves over time - i.e.
 the accumulation of wealth and long-term status of consumers in the real
 world - is relatively more nuanced than how our representative consumer
 perceives it.
 While the income in the long-run may depend on acquisition of skills, economic
 development, movement of labor and other macroeconomic variables, the informati
on available to consumers is often disparate and less relevant than local
 status needs.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is not to suggest that the consumer's belief of clustering of assets
 is completely ill-founded.
 Clusters of high or low net asset worth indeed move together as the economy
 changes.
 The model only claims that there is asymmetry in how the income process
 is observed across the spectrum of consumers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

This asymmetry of information can create a competition for status indication
 through consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between the idea of total net worth of an individual and
 the status of an individual as observed by the representative consumer
 could also be viewed as a difference in granularity and of speed of information.
 The true nature of economic changes are often limited to the informed and
 well-equipped sections of the society.
 It is more likely in a population of consumers that the individual motivations
 for consumption develop through an exchange of personal characteristics
 in personal interactions rather than through a deeper understanding of
 economic factors 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a mere restatement of the existence of local status competitions.
 In personal interactions, one is more likely to observe and influence factors
 such as owned assets, social connections, social intelligence, family backgroun
d, social identity, or regional background.
 Based on arguments similar to those for relevance of visibility, we could
 argue that family background and regional identity may matter more in rural
 vs urban settings in the developing world.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 affecting the growth of economy.
 Since consumption and advertising are often made more relevant to consumers,
 their decisions are more likely to be driven by a simpler notion of status-divi
sions - a tendency that lets status consumption become self-fulfilling prophecy
 - by letting the status differences and the consumption depend on each
 other in the short-run.
 The consumer is more likely to have a status-and-income levels based understand
ing that is developed over her lifetime experience (by smoothening her expenditu
re and income) rather than an economic expectation of her surroundings
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Though similar in formulation, the permanent income model treats consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 as a multiple of smoothened (permanent) income - an assumption that we
 don't make in our model.
 Further, pertinent to status competitions in the society, our model asserts
 that the consumer saves income not only for income security but for social
 status that may provide her security in non-financial terms as well.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 More differences in society therefore can encourage the consumer to spend
 more on status goods if she believes in the existence of status differences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The short-term effect on status determinants are ruled out in our model
 - but the status perceptions would matter in the long-run as they may bring
 the consumers spending on status goods in close interaction with those
 who have higher status (e.g.
 through participation in the market, workplace or social situations etc.)
 or impart confidence and avoid risk-aversion.
 The entrepreneurs or high-earners may increase their asset worth as the
 economy progresses - and thus their status advantage would be sooner in
 the model - compared to the status advantage of a consumer of status goods
 who hopes to gain through social interactions or with the increased (subjective
) probability of becoming rich (which may make her less risk-averse).
 The gain in status from a lower status through assets acquisition would
 be faster than the decline in status as the relative ranking through asset
 ownership (
\begin_inset Formula $r_{A},r_{C})$
\end_inset

 declines i.e.
 rising to a higher status through assets purchase is faster than falling
 from a higher status.
 Status advantage being relative and slow to decline provides the kind of
 security that a consumer hopes through status consumption.

Status in intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status can be viewed as uncertainty in the intertemporal substitution problem
 - arising out of the difference between the income process and its status-based
 perception.
 From the consumer's perspective, the intertemporal problem is about choosing
 between assets, consumption and status (which is viewed as the expectation
 of income improvement).
 Other than buying assets that grow in value and consuming for pure enjoyment,
 the representative consumer attempts to fulfill the local status competitions
 needs
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The difference between private and public consumption i.e.
 the extent to which one's happiness is defined by one's surroundings is
 different from what could be the person's own practical needs is immaterial
 for us - since we accept the existence of local status competitions.
 In fact, when all items can potentially signal status and promote the perceived
 status, there is no such thing as private consumption.

 a higher status cluster in society 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This belief is accentuated through consumption in a common market - which
 makes status signals more universal.
 Whereas earlier a consumer could feel good about herself in the local level,
 now the knowledge of a more connected world may make bring the goods from
 the common market essential in the local status competitions.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The status-based belief or the expectation of the income (based on the subjectiv
e probability) motivates her to improve her status through a higher priced
 assets consumption - these mechanisms also set her above the rest in status
 hierarchy she believes in.
 The consumer therefore maximises the expected utility (including both income
 and the probability of status improvemnt) at every time period given the
 uncertainty around the income process.

Status and personal characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The role of personal characteristics in status determination requires a
 few clarifications.
 We have so far assumed that personal characteristics are static.
 However, changes in residence, marriage or social networks can impart a
 status advantage to the individual (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BlochRaoDesaiIndiaMarriage"

\end_inset

 for a discussion on marriage as conspicuous consumption in India).
 In a model that considers personal characteristics a determinant of status,
 the possibility of change in personal characteristics must be acknowledged.
 Since status is often tied with personal characteristics of those who own
 more assets, it may be tempting to consider personal characteristics alone
 for status inferences - and claim that status perceptions are so slow to
 change that they're inferred only by observing personal characteristics.
 The personal characteristics vector in this general view may then include
 asset ownership and consumer identity (city-dweller, house-owner or car-owner)
 as well as long-term personal characteristics (whose status determination
 power depends on the generational record of long-term asset-ownership).
 One desirable property of such an assumption is the separability of utilities
 - with personal characteristics being generic and dynamic and not providing
 any benefit other than that of status.
 If we were to consider all asset-ownership and consumer-identity as a personal
 characteristics, then status-changes through change in personal characteristics
 would become equivalent to consumption and asset ownership.
 However, the assumption that people change their personal identities just
 the way they purchase assets or consume can be an oversimplifying one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we do continue with the assumption that status is determined by personal
 characteristics alone, then we can further split status function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 in a personal characteristic selection function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi$
\end_inset

 (that determines which personal characteristic denote high status) and
 characteristic weighting function

 For all characteristics that don't have any status advantage - the value

 a characteristic that dominated the the rich characteristics in the past
 i.e.

\end_inset

 may no longer have a higher status weight in

\begin_layout Standard
Our current approach avoids such a manipulation of personal characteristics
 vector and fixes the number of characteristics in the model - so consumers
 can only switch between these characteristics (e.g.
 by moving, marrying etc.) - the development of the new identities is not
 allowed in the current model.
 Consumers may only buy new assets in this model but they don't invent new
 personal characteristics by doing that.
 To clarify this, let's consider the ability to speak English in Tanzania
 or India - where this skill can signal high-status.
 Our status model would treat being English-speaking as an asset in the
 marketplace.
 If English-speaking were a personal characteristic then we would have needed
 to adopt a model where personal characteristics are dynamic - since people
 can invest in English education and develop that characteristic.
 If we don't consider English-speaking a personal characteristic, then it
 must be seen as an asset and we must adopt a model where status is not
 determined by personal characteristics alone.
 We choose the latter view (considering English skills as an asset) combined
 with a closed set of personal characteristics, a switch between which (e.g.
 with marriage or migration) can also impart status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that assets acquired over a longer period of time through installmen
t payments are still seen as an expenditure on the asset - whose value would
 be the market value of the equity in the asset at the valuation time -
 e.g.
 for housing through mortgages.
 If the data is not available on the equity at the current time, then the
 monthly expenditure could be multiplied with the average length of the
 installments (e.g.
 mortgage for a house).
 The developing countries don't have a significant market for mortgages
 or credit so this problem is less of an issue, but an implication of such
 a valuation is for an asset such as English or other workplace skills -
 where the average length of the education/training can provide a running
 value of the asset (given that the value of English education in the market
 can be derived).

Limitations to the model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That there is a common ontological basis for status - which we base on scarcity
 - could be a strong assumption for some.
 To explain this issue with a paradox, if two groups 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 just have a bad opinion of each other, then their status inferences would
 be shaped foremost by their mutual animosity.
 Such instances are not uncommon in diverse or unstable countries - where
 the prospect of status promotion through change in personal characteristic
 or the hope of status mobility through asset acquisition is rather meaningless.
 No proportion of asset ownership in such cases may change status.
 However, we have no reason to believe that conspicuous consumption exists
 in such an environment either.
 A common market is often a prerequisite for conspicuous consumption - so
 that the groups 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 allow the consumption to let identities interchange assets and influence
 status - while still letting their sectarian identities have a role in
 status.
 The possibility of status being observed differently amongst different
 groups in the model would require a further enhancement.

Regressors and instruments in implementation of ivreg in R-toolbox AER are
 specified in a formula with two parts on the right-hand side.
 The specification - used in this note - can be either of the form - 
\family typewriter
y ~ ex + en | ex + in 
\family default
or as 
\family typewriter
y ~ ex + en | .
 - en +in 
\family default
(where 
\family typewriter
ex
\family default
 is the set of exogenous variables, 
\family typewriter
en
\family default
 is the set of endogenous variables and 
\family typewriter
in 
\family default
the set of instruments) .
 The latter is the notation used throughout in this section.

 (with black-dummy and coloured-dummy), the coefficients for coloured and
 black are negative (i.e.
 black and coloured social groups spend less on visible consumption than
 the white population).
 However, these coefficients flip signs after adding income controls(II)

- where lninc is log(income_household_head).

.
 The endogeneity of total expenditure requires instrumentation - Kaus uses
 instruments suggested by Charles, Roussanov and Hurst - including positive-inco
me-dummy, cube-of-income-level, dummies for under-secondary-education, secondary
-education and degree-education.
 Kaus then performs two 2SLS regressions - one with income controls and
 total-expenditure as control variables

 The instrumentation thus performed (Specification IV in Table

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-change of sign when income controls are added implies that after
 accounting for income of household head, the coloured and black groups
 spend more on visible consumption.
 Total expenditure is not a perfect proxy of permanent income - which justifies
 instrumentation.
 After resolving these endogeneity concerns - with a regression of visible
 expenditure as dependent variable and total-expenditure as one of the control
 variables - the signs are revised - although 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 does not change a lot.
 Adding demographic controls to the 2SLS regression - shows significance
 of age, urban/rural area and family size - but coefficients are still not
 lowered significantly.
 This confirms that coloured and black social groups spend a rather disproportio
nate amount on visible consumption.
 Kaus paper is interested in testing whether the rise in average group income
 reduces the visible consumption.
 The regression considers average-incomes of particular provinces for every
 group (black/white/coloured).
 This regression shows the effect more on black-social-group than the white-soci
al-group - a difference that author argues points out alternate ways of
 signaling for white-social-group relative to black-social-group.

 The hispanic dummy is inferred by the

 variable in CEX data - which is recorded side-by-side with the race variable.
 This means that households/individuals can associate with either white
 or black while recording their ethnicity.
 Only about 1489 out of 22980 households surveyed in years 2004, 2009 and
 2014, for example, associate with neither white nor black.
 If that criterion is relaxed (i.e.
 if anyone reporting the horref1 variable is considered hispanic for the
 study) the number of Hispanics in the survey almost doubles.
 Starting with no controls(I)

.
 While the visibility surveys (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) attempt to study how consumption on certain commodities may signal status,
 the goal of the proposed game is to characterise environments under which
 the perceptions of a higher-status may develop.
 The game attempts to emulate i) the consumer market and ii) the mechanism
 through which status may be assigned within a group of consumers.
 It therefore relies on participants playing the dual role of a consumer
 and status-observer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The activities of purchasing and assigning status are separate in the game.
 Since a simulated purchase performed by the participants in the game (given
 a list of commodities, prices and outlay) is quite likely to deviate from
 their real world purchases and their real needs, the participants are instead
 asked what additional items they would purchase for a given a basket of
 commodities that they already possess (using a cumulative voting scheme
 that emulates selection of commodities in a market - see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Purchasing_Mechanism"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The second part of the game emulates status assignment - where participants
 assign a score of status and effectiveness each to 3 (or more) other participan
ts in the game by looking at the quantities of the item categories possessed
 and purchased by the latter.
 The judgment of status in the real world does not involve direct observance
 of prices and thus it is only the quantity of the identified items consumed
 or already possessed that matters in the status-assignment part of the
 game.
 The end-goal of the game is to purchase a basket most desired by others
 - the winner achieves this goal by purchasing commodities of her choice
 that are most desirable by everyone and are indicative of a rank higher
 than everyone else in the game.

 Hence, instead of asking the respondent how they'll spend the given outlay

 is made of non-positional items, the participants choose 3 items from a
 mix of non-positional items and positional items - given the 10% extra
 outlay.
 Since all participants cannot be assumed to be equally numerate, the game
 uses a scheme similar to cumulative voting - where 10 virtual coins are
 provided to the participant and the participant is asked to distribute
 the coins amongst a set of available items (both positional and non-positional).
 The provided outlay in the game (number of coins) may vary for participants
 - in proportion to the income distribution that is observed in the relevant
 consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS for Tanzania).

 all baskets have the same set of categories).

Constraints and Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The game attempts to measure status and consumption with respect to high
 asset ownership, social class or familial responsibility.
 Since players choose between physical needs and positional needs in the
 game, a different circumstance is likely to affect their choice and hence
 their perceived status.
 The game presents a precondition to the player - indicating high asset
 ownership, a chosen social class or a familial liability.
 For example, to test a participant's choice between food and electricity,
 the game can present a large family as a constraint, and record the choice
 between spending more on food vs installing electricity.
 The game thus measures indirect effects of reward or constraints on status
 by allowing participants to gauge the suitability of a participant's choice
 in the status game in the presence of constraints (familial) or rewards
 (asset-related).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Notice that the constraint variable is only planned to be binary in the
 current scheme i.e.
 it is either a reward or a liability (when present).
 The two values are expected to have an opposite affect on the purchase
 of new items.
 Admittedly, the binary values of constraints vs rewards circumvent the
 difficulty in comparisons between disparate needs of the consumers - e.g.
 a large family, senior member or a social event (e.g.
 marriage/funeral).
 While a multi-valued variable (if adopted) can potentially provide better
 insights into the relative effects of these several types constraints,
 the goal of the current exercise is to test for a direct effect of constraints
 on status (rather than relative effect of the various possible constraints).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\paragraph_spacing single
Status ranking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The status-ranking activity involves a student assigning a status score
 by looking at i) what the other participant with a given income level does
 with the extra outlay and ii) what the participant already possesses.
 In the ranking scheme, the participants provide a score on effectiveness
 as well as status to all the other (3 or more) participants observed.
 Notice that in presence of constraints specified in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

, regardless of whether one is selfish or not, a participant would tend
 to penalise someone else who she thinks is going to be more selfish than
 herself.
 Since the game provides a way to penalize selfishness by status ranks,
 the participants are discouraged from indicating status through overspending
 on positional items.
 The penalty for not caring for a sick parent may be huge in the society
 but so can be the penalty for being stingy.
 Similarly, while some may want to indicate wealth by buying a watch they
 may also fear disrespect for not taking care of a sick family member.
 The scores on effectiveness and status are thus not only a way to discourage
 the consumer from limiting the unrealistic purchases in the simulated purchasin
g part of the game, they also track the effect of the externalities such
 as sickness or age (measured through the binary variable discussed in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
While consumers try to maximise their utility by purchasing more items for
 a given limited outlay - they also manage their prestige by letting others
 have a better opinion of themselves.
 The status game can thus be seen as an enhanced version of the survey that
 asks people to imagine a neighbour who spends more than them on a chosen
 commodity (used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

).
 The proposed game attempts to measure how consumers might act given a certain
 circumstances while both status and welfare (effectiveness score can be
 seen as a proxy of concern for others) become part of the payoff function
 in the game.

Welfare and Status competitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The solution of this game for a set of rational players remains a pending
 exercise in this study.
 The key motivation for the analysis at this point is that fundamentally
 all social welfare concerns are concerns of Pareto optimality.
 Moreover, the payoff function for effectiveness in the game is meant to
 be a proxy for welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
With Pareto optimality in mind, more spending on education, health seems
 desirable - but it may be become distant for consumers due to their immediate
 needs - whether positional or non-positional.
 A comparison with what is observed in consumption data versus what is observed
 about positional consumption in games can provide some insight into the
 social status that can influence the desired welfare equilibrium.

Policy implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The discussion so far leans towards permitting status competitions rather
 than attempting to tax or control them.
 This is in line with the suggestions offered by Robert H Frank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 favouring a non-monetary market of statuses only so that status games (which
 are a necessity) do not overlap with the market for real goods.
 Due to structural reasons of the modern economy, advertising efforts can
 turn a social scarcity into a physical scarcity (to use the Hirsch's terminolog
y
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"

\end_inset

).
 A profit-driven industry and the advertising pursued by the companies tend
 to increase the status competition for a commodity.
 Instead of letting status competitions modify the distribution of that
 physical goods through competition (and thus do little to avoid the problem
 of physical scarcities in the developing countries), policy can attempt
 to provide status-games in a world of non-necessity items - in some ways
 to diffuse the status competitions in the society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In poor and non-pecuniary societies, the desire to become rich or the benefit
 of inheriting money and education is often less reachable.
 Status and money translate into social securities in unstructured societies.
 These may well be detected in the countries in Africa - but limited data
 on household characteristics in Tanzania (related to ethnicity or religion)
 have prevented us from such an analysis for Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The question that we seek the answer for in the context of Tanzania (or
 another developing country) is whether the expenditure on high-status or
 scarce items (an analysis similar to one conducted by Prais Houthakker
 for expensive and cheap tea varieties amongst social classes in the UK
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerFamilySurvey"

\end_inset

) - is actually more desirable than on housing and education.
 The designed experiment intends to find answer to this question.
 If the answer is indeed the former, then it makes sense to limit the status
 competitions through policy to support status competitions on non-essential
 items (possibly by introducing brand differentiation).
 Attaching glamour to education, healthcare and food items may help consumers
 prioritize their needs.
