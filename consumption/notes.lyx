\begin_layout Abstract
Status competitions amongst workers often explain the income distribution
 better than the permanent income or productivity models.
 The current study looks for instances of status competitions within communities
 in developing countries, focusing on sub-Saharan African countries where
 recent large-scale urban migrations and proliferation of industrial products
 has occurred amidst social upheavals.
 The goal of this study is twofold.
 First, it comments on changes in status competitions in response to proliferati
on of industrial products, changing family characteristics, regional effects
 and social interaction levels.
 Second, it compares the effect of advertising and marketing on consumption
 in the developed world with the emergence of new social scarcities in the
 developed world - arguing that the socio-political environment of the developin
g world has done little to curtail or encourage status competitions at local
 levels.
 The study uses the framework and terminology of Fred Hirsch who had discussed
 the increasing effect of advertising and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

congestions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 related to positional consumption in the post-war distribution of resources.
 The contention of the study is that physical scarcity in the developing
 countries does not rule out social scarcity and that the status competitions
 and positional consumption - which are identified by observed differences
 in prices and availability in the study - must be considered for a better
 understanding of urban migration patterns and consumption pressures.

Economists have long explored relative prosperity as a determinant of personal
 happiness.
 A challenge to the rational expectations theory appears when despite being
 richer in absolute terms, a young adult in a poor urban neighborhood in
 the developed world may be unhappier than the elite in many developing
 countries.
 Discussing necessities in this context of relative poverty, Sen, for example,
 points out that the television is a need for the school education of a
 British child in a way it isn't for a Tanzanian child

 In Sen's view, the resolution of relative poverty is a problem different
 resolving absolute poverty in the developing world.

The current study emphasises on the necessity of resolving relative poverty
 - if not for the evasive goals of happiness then for the risk-aversions
 and social inequity that severe economic inequalities can bring.

 neither the Permanent Income model nor the productivity models explains

Focusing primarily on post-war developments in the Western society, Fred
 Hirsch had given similar forewarnings of the effects of intensifying status
 competitions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithAffluent"

\end_inset

.
 In modern society, Hirsch argued, the needs have expanded manifolds since
 the time when Adam Smith's invisible hand was known to work.
 In Europe of eighteenth century, the rich could pursue their interests
 while the poor gained mobility in exchange of their participation.
 Through immense success of capitalism by the twentieth century however,
 this exchange was no longer appealing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmithMoralSentiments,SchumpeterCapitalism"

\end_inset

.
 In the absence of social mobility to offer for exchange, the distribution
 of resources was to occur through status competitions - a post-war process
 where positional goods and advertisement had a major role to play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
While Hirsch does seem to engage in some prophetism as he warns of rationing
 of living spaces and other public goods through status competitions, there
 are two key phenomena that are relevant to the mechanics of status competitions
 - 
\series bold
scarcity
\series default
 and 
\series bold
congestion
\series default
.
 With physical scarcity of goods largely conquered (food and amenities),
 scarcity appears largely social in the developed countries.
 More commercialization leads to more scarcities and more competitions -
 hence congestion for goods provides a measure of the degree of social scarcity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The difference between physical and social scarcities seems unclear in this
 analysis - not only because it is a difficult classification problem in
 practice but also because, according to Hirsch, the boundary between physical
 and social scarcity can get blurred by the positional goods creating a
 market for themselves.
 In context of the developing world, the creation of scarcity through 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overuse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (which Hirsch stresses as the engine of social scarcity) is less relevant
 as the congestion for goods is less often for status needs (physical scarcities
 are severe in the developing world).
 That said, with recent developments in the underdeveloped world we are
 more likely to see a mixed effect of commercialization and physical scarcities
 with an increasing effect of status competitions.
 The distinction between physical and social scarcity is less relevant in
 this regard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Frank's interpretation of social scarcity is a relevant extension to the
 model of status competitions.
 In this model, social interaction amongst participants is a proxy of congestion.
 Focusing primarily on income distribution, Frank's axiomatic claim - that
 in the absence of monopolies, corporations cannot survive by rewarding
 talent alone and are thus compelled to depend on status competitions for
 income distribution - provides a microeconomic illustration of social scarcity
 (wherein attributes such as workplace safety get overpriced because of
 status maximization goals).
 The role of social interaction is equally relevant in the developing countries
 where industrial development and societal competitions have interacted
 and clashed very recently(See Section

 higher social positions once held by the feudal elite

 Developments of the last century in Africa and Asia bear similarity to
 this phenomenon where a new working class has clashed with feudal and colonial
 systems of the century before.
 The growing status competitions amongst the nascent working classes have
 been a subject of sociological study.
 In India of the 1950s, this competition was termed as Sanskritization when

It would be inaccurate though to draw wide conclusions based on economic
 poverty.
 The administrative successes and stabilities of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended largely on the extent of agrarian empires
 that had existed before.
 The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires,
 for example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries
 when compared to the administrative units (much as the political boundaries
 themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.

Despite regional differences, the political landscape of Asian and African
 economies is dominated by effects of decolonization - a process that encompasse
s the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia and Africa aspiring
 to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 - often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike - their limited reach and success has prevented the institutional
 expression of status competitions.
 It remains to be seen whether countries under conflict have higher degrees
 of status competitions or not, but there is little doubt that government-driven
 resettlements and urban movements are intertwined with the dynamics of
 status competitions.
 The competitions that may have otherwise been limited to tribal or local
 levels have just started expanding to urban settlements

 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and usage of a capital-intensive technology
 soon resulted in oversubsidizing across sectors, overreliance on capital

The dynamics of urban migration can serve as a field-study of consumption
 patterns for the context of this note.
 A flight to urban areas is often an escape from despondent circumstances
 as well as an opportunity of improbable social mobilities.
 A model where migrants move for rational expectations seems rather inadequate.
 In the developing economies, cities provide a range of products that are
 entirely absent from the agrarian rural settings.
 It is expected that the microdynamics of migration to urban centres would
 be signaled through consumption pressures for positional goods in the rural
 areas.
 Overcrowding and massive informal sectors in the urban can also indicate
 possibly irrational obsessions with industrial goods and a lifestyle with
 global appeal.

The classification of a signaling product is a non-trivial exercise - but
 in simple terms, a signaling product indicates status to the immediate
 surroundings.
 However, if only the rich could afford electricity in a society, electricity
 is hardly a signaling product.
 While some consumers may indeed get their signaling needs fulfilled by
 using electricity (and thus pay a higher budget share), the equilibrium
 consumption values can easily shift when a higher supply is provided (more
 electrical power plants or cheaper alternative energy would reduce the
 budget share).
 In the case of conspicuous consumption, the budget share is less susceptible
 to increased supply.
 Higher budget shares are needed for signaling needs despite the availability
 of cheaper alternatives.
 Hirsch considers 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overuse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a criterion for this selection i.e.
 when individuals use a commodity too much, its signaling qualities decline
 (electricity is not sensitive to overuse and hence not a signaling product).

In the Hirschian terminology, electricity is in fact a direct physical scarcity.
 It follows that the rich spending more on electricity is beneficial for
 society - since it can potentiallly fund employment and other opportunities
 (including expansion of power plants) - putting the invisible hand to work.
 In the world where Hirsch had lived, however, conspicuous consumption became
 relevant only after the differences between the rich and poor were reduced
 to a level that the exchange could not be made lucrative to the poor any
 more.
 In other words, the price of luxuries exceeded the opportunity cost to
 the rest of the society

 So although the status competitions had been there for a long time, their
 importance in allocation of income become relevant only when the physical
 scarcities had been conquered in the Western societies.
 Developing countries, having followed their own paths in achieving goals
 of nationalism have had a different experience.
 Although social scarcity does not seem so relevant to the conditions in
 sub-Saharan Africa (where the physical scarcity is stark), the formation
 of monetary and governmental institutions has created an environment where
 status competitions can cause the distribution of resource out of favour
 with Adam Smith's principles.
 That the marketable goods create a market of their own is after all a maxim
 equally relevant to the developing countries.

Measuring Status Competition

A measurement of positional consumption isn't possible without the classificatio
n of positional items - as it rests on an entirely socio-cultural judgment.
 The criterion of classification chosen in this study is inspired by the
 Hirsch's notion of congestion - which causes physical or social scarcities.
 For the current study, the difference between physical and social scarcities
 is ignored.
 One simple criterion employed in classificaton of items is the difference
 in prices (wherever available).
 For items that are physical scarce, the price differences between commodities
 is less likely (although still possible due to distribution and storage
 costs involved).
 On the other hand, every product where price differences exist is a potential
 signaling product that can create congestion.
 As a positional product can create a market of its own, the marginal effect
 of a new product of over time can provide a further test for signaling
 capability.

\begin_layout Standard

A comparison of a spatially or economically excluded area with with denser
 urban areas can provide insights on status competitions.
 We can also test whether the proxies of social interaction (family members

 have a relily to have signaling effects but for which number of family
 members is not significant).

If consumption pressures are explained by the level of urbanization, population

 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism is inherent in all exchange of goods and services (including

A survey quantifies a lot of complex interations in what constitutes status
 competitions in a society.
 A luxury item - for example - needs to be marketed as a luxury for it to
 both impart visible signals to others and to improve self-perception of
 the buyer.
 In Veblen's original framework, for a product to indicate status it must
 be rare and superfluous (thus serve as an exploit).
 That a watch is more noticeable than an insurance policy (and associated
 with higher income) is not entirely relevant to this framework.
 Moreover, whether a poor person buying a cheap watch and a richer person
 buying a watch that is far more expensive (and probably subject to import
 restrictions) are both instances of conspicuous consumption or not depends
 on the context that the observer chooses.
 Cheap watches may or may not constitute conspicuous consumption - depending
 on the social welfare function.
 The wide variety of criteria in conscpicous consumption seem to indicate
 this ambiguity (See Table

).

The choice of visible and non-visible goods matters more in developing markets
 where a culture of mass consumerism is only nascent and status competitions
 aren't driven by economic inequalities alone (whereas in developed markets,
 firms are quick to turn a conspicuous item into a higher-priced commodity).
 The context of exploits identified by Veblen is however still relevant
 in the developing markets

 If status were imparted by inherited wealth alone, there would be little
 conspicuous consumption as the consumers would be quick to realise the
 futility of buying trinkets.
 In the developed world, where markets have evolved to address the demands
 of the population, the positional pressures are readily addressed by market
 forces - thus a preference for visible goods indicates a higher price on
 them and a higher consumption on visible products always

 a higher status (a product with a higher status symbol would automatically
 carry a higher price).
 In underdeveloped markets, where information asymmetries are abound, the
 higher signalling (visible component of combined utility) would not necessarily
 be achieved with higher spending on visible goods - and other factors start
 to matter in the combined utility function - as is suggested by data from
 various cross-section expenditure surveys.

A rural setting in a developing country more often evokes images of immiserizati
on than competitions for positional consumption.
 Still, the visual splurge offered by the new economic developments offers
 new venues of visible consumption in the urban developing world.
 Here, the basket of visible and industrial consumption has expanded, a
 new spirit of individual consumerism has replaced the rural contractual
 arrangements left untouched by successive nationalist governments.
 Looking at Tanzania, the spending on marriage and funerals seems high,
 but it now competes with higher spending on consumer electronics and electricit

The utility function is modeled as a combination of a private consumption
 function and an observable consumption function.
 Considering the Cobb-Douglas utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)=\beta_{v}\cdot f(v,w)+\beta_{w}ln(w)$
\end_inset

 over constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $y=v+w$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is the budget constraint and 
\begin_inset Formula $(v$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $w)$
\end_inset

 are visible and non-visible good quantities respectively.
 Instead of the standard Engle curve model : 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\frac{{\beta}}{1+\beta}y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\frac{{1}}{1+\beta}y$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{{\beta_{v}}}{\beta_{w}})$
\end_inset

, the authors use the model provided by Ireland et al (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

).
 Using an individual's sensitivity to social status signals in the model,
 they use a utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)f(v,w)+af(\hat{v},\hat{w})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{v},\hat{w}$
\end_inset

 are societies' view of the consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

).
 Solving for a separating equilibrium, this results in 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{{1+\beta}}{a+\beta}+Cv^{-\frac{{\beta}}{a}}(a>0)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\frac{{a}}{a+\beta}(\frac{\beta}{1+\beta})^{\frac{{\beta}}{a}}b^{\frac{{a+\beta}}{a}}$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is derived by considering the  utility maximization at lowest income level
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 as the boundary condition for the utility maximization problem).
 Elasticities in this model are 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{v}=\frac{{dv}}{dy}\cdot\frac{{y}}{v}=a((1+\beta)\frac{{v}}{y}-\beta)^{-1}$

The need for a survey to measure visibility of items in the basket is however

 ask two key questions to respondents in an online survey conducted in India.
 First asked them how closely they needed to interact with their neighbour
 (with similar demographic characteristics) in order to observe above average
 spending for a list of items (Options were -‘1: No Interaction’, ‘2: Occasional
 Interaction’, ‘3: Friend’, ‘4: Close Friend’ or ‘5: No matter how much
 one Interacts’).
 An item where >20% respondents report 1 or 2 was considered a visible item.
 A second question asked them what they'll expect of the consumption of
 an item after a sudden 20 percent rise in their neighbor's income ‘1: Fall’,
 ‘2: Stay the same’, ‘3: Increase by less than 20 percent’, ‘4: Increase
 by 20 percent’ or ‘5: Increase by more than 20 percent’.
 The list of items in these questions attempted to match the consumption
 categories in the IHDS.
 An item is associated with higher income if more than 20% of respondents
 reported 2,3,4 or 5.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Visibility is a socio-cultural judgment - and the visibility basket from
 the developed world cannot be translated as such into disparate geographies
 and cultural environments of the developing world.
 One can arrive at wrong conclusions on visibile consumption for a consumer
 group if a visiblity basket was chosen from a different cultural environment.
 For example, hair-products may be associated with a higher visibility (and
 promise) in the developed world but in the developing world their purpose
 could be just utilitarian (poor quality of production, cultural factors
 etc.).
 Attributing lower visible consumption based on a low consumption of hair-produc
ts would thus be erroneous.

Another practical problem arises in the developing world because of the
 predominant use of recall method in expenditure survey.
 A relevant anomaly is the Deaton Paxson paradox(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonPaxsonParadox"

\end_inset

) - i.e.
 the observed decrease in food expenditure per head as household size rises
 (with constant outlay per head).
 The likely cause for the paradox is presence of errors correlated with
 household size in the data that results in possible overestimation of the
 consumption of recalled items
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonDeatonPaxson"

.
 Caution must therefore be taken (or a correction applied) when mixing expenditu
res from recall and diary methods.

While the visibility elasticities may not be compared across countries without
 above considerations but a comparison within the country can provide insights
 into the effect of certain demographic factors on visible consumption.
 This has been the central theme for most of the studies surveyed in this
 note.
 More than to improve the mesurement of visibility, the studies are interested
 in identifying the demographic parameters that explain the log-expenditure
 of visibilty basket as is.
 The general regression equation for such a study is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (accumulated over the chosen visibility basket), 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure.
 Households with higher total expenditure are far more likely to be those
 with higher visible expenditure.
 Thus, total expenditure (on the right side of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lnvis_regression"

\end_inset

) makes it an endogenous variable for the dependent varaible : 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(vis_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 A different approach is taken by Jaikumar et al who use weights in the
 basket rather than visible expenditure levels - so that visible expenditure
 is not subject to the endogeneity problem that arises due to total expenditure
 being on the right hand side and visible expenditure on left hand side
 of the equation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"

\end_inset

 (The proportion of visible expenditure with respect to the total expenditure
 could be the same for those with higher total expenditure and lower total
 expenditure).
 However, since data on income is often poor or sparse in the developing
 countries, total expenditure turns out to be the most frequent choice for
 a proxy of permanent income (
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a key control parameter for the analysis of visible consumption).
 In most of the studies, the said endogeneity of total expenditure is resolved
 by a choice of appropriate instruments - e.g.
 income, cubic-income, postive-income dummies or occupation codes.
 These instruments identified by Charles et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

 are reported to be quite strong in the studies surveyed as part of this
 note (Sargan and Wu-Hausman tests confirm endogeneity and the effectiveness
 of chosen instruments).

 (with black-dummy and coloured-dummy), the coefficients for coloured and
 black are negative (i.e.
 black and coloured social groups spend less on visible consumption than
 the white population).
 However, these coefficients flip signs after adding income controls(II)

 The endogeneity of total expenditure requires instrumentation - Kaus uses
 instruments suggested by Charles, Roussanov and Hurst - including positive-inco
me-dummy, cube-of-income-level, dummies for under-secondary-education, secondary
-eduation and degree-education.
 Kaus then performs two 2SLS regressions - one with income controls and
 total-expenditure as control variables

 The instrumentation thus performed (Specification IV in Table

All of the above interpretations match with those reported in Kaus's paper.
 The regression V from the paper is ommitted for 1995 - as the data on visible
 consumption from 2005/2010 wasn't available from datafirst to be included
 in the regression with year-dummies.
 The data from 2000 - is of poor quality (as explained by Kaus) and does
 not have enough household characteristic fields for applying an analysis
 in the Kaus's paper - and was thus discarded altogether.
 For 2005/2010, the only field amongst all in the visible category available
 to us - is the number-of-cars-owned by the household ( rather than cars
 purchased in the surveyed period).
 Hardly meant to conclusive on visible consumption, if owned cars were still
 to be considered the proxy for visible consumption, a reversal of signs
 after adding of income-controls is not observed.
 Other results equivalent to 1995 result-set are summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "resresults-2"

\end_inset

 (Notice that specification V is possible when more than an year is available
 for analysis).
 What the results suggest is only that unlike visible consumption, the ownership
 of cars is very much influenced by permanent income (and other wealth character
istics accounting for lower ownership of cars for the black and coloured
 groups).

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The first-change of sign when income controls are added implies that after
 accounting for income of household head, the coloured and black groups
 spend more on visible consumption.
 Total expenditure is not a perfect proxy of permanent income - which justifies
 instrumentation.
 After resolving these endogeneity concerns - with a regression of visible
 expenditure as dependent variable and total-expenditure as one of the control
 variables - the signs are revised - although 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 does not change a lot.
 Adding demographic controls to the 2SLS regression - shows significance
 of age, urban/rural area and family size - but coefficients are still not
 lowered significantly.
 This confirms that coloured and black social groups spend a rather disprportion
ate amount on visible consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The second claim that the paper is interested in is testing whether the
 rise in average group income reduces the visible consumption.
 The regression considers average-incomes of particular provinces for every
 group (black/white/coloured).
 This regression shows the effect more on black-social-group than the white-soci
al-group - a difference that author argues points out alternate ways of
 signaling for white-social-group relative to black-social-group.

Regressions on Consumer Expenditure Survey

\begin_layout Standard
The authors consider a black-dummy and hispanic-dummy in regression of visible
 consumption against demographic, time, permanent income and household character
isitcs.
 The hispanic dummy is inferred by the

\end_inset

 variable in CEX data - which is recorded side-by-side with the race variable.
 This means that housholds/individuals can associate with either white or
 black while recording their ethnicity.
 Only about 1489 out of 22980 households surveyed in years 2004, 2009 and
 2014, for example, associate with neither white nor black.
 If that criterion is relaxed (i.e.
 if anyhone reporting the horref1 variable is considered hispanic for the
 study) the number of hispanics in the survey almost doubles.
 Starting with no controls(I)

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 (with black-dummy and hispanic-dummy), the coefficients for coloured and

 black and hispanic social groups spend less on visible consumption than
 the white population).
 These coefficients flip signs after adding income controls(II)

 The instrumentation thus performed (Specification IV in Table

LSMS 2010 data on Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Tanzania has been the first country to be surveyed as part of this study.
 With recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, the country
 provides a much desired snapshot of the consumer world of developing sub-Sahara
n Africa.
 The data chosen for the preliminary analysis is from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) conducted by the World Bank.
 LSMS includes expenditure microdata from about 10,000 households - with
 many of the expenditure categories of potential visible value.
 With no verifiable measure of visibility, all expenditure not related to
 food and utilities is evaluated for potentially visiblity.
 These chosen cateogries from LSMS are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Visible-commodities"

\end_inset

 - these are meant to include the categories identified by Khamis et al
 as far as possible

The income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

 region and same employment-type have resonably similar incomes.
 The variance in incomes recorded for the same local group can give an estimate
 of how noisy the data is due to self-reporting.

Heffetz finds that the degree to which people notice items explains the
 corresponding (permanent) income elasticities better.
 This observation has provided the basis for inspection of visible consumption
 in many studies thereforth.
 In an environment of inequalities, however, it is likely that the indvidiuals
 with perceived higher status notice items differently from how the lower
 status individuals might notice them.
 The social factors thus relevant for the difference in visible preferences
 are sought in the studies on visible consumption in the developing countries.
 In India, this is found to be religion and caste - while in South Africa
 and United States, race seems to have a dominant significance.
 It is also worth noting that the developing countries may offer a less
 consumerist agrarian environment overall where expenditure is more visible
 than in a relatively individualistic and industrialized society.

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In a developing economy, the criterion for conspicuous consumption is clearly
 not just noticeability any more.
 Visible consumption may detail the mechanics of status competitions in
 a narrow sense where consumers participate in a market to increase their
 perceived status - but it does not provide an adequate picture of conspicuous
 consumption.
 One reason is that markets are underdeveloped in the developing world and
 social status is largely yielded through economic classes and social conditions.
 The second - probably more significant - reason is that status signaling
 does not exist in a society as an inherent need for visible appeal amongst
 humans.
 Instead visible consumption matters because of an item being associated
 with a higher status (at least in the sense which Veblen had talked about
 in his 19th century treatise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
A study of status and scarcity of items therefore goes hand in hand with
 the study of conspicuous consumption.
 Instead of limiting ourselves to visible consumption as the particular
 mechanics of status signaling - where consumers buy items in a common market
 and (presumably) over-weigh on items that are more noticeable - we attempt
 to understand the reasons behind status-signaling by looking at the differences
 in patterns between the richer and poorer sections of society and attempt
 to understand how unavailability of items (scarcity) as well as disparities
 of services across regions and classes in a society are reflected in both
 price and consumption of commodities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
This is not to discount a study of visible consumption or the importance
 of a visiblity survey in any way.
 In fact, visible consumption is ever more relevant with recent trends in
 advertisement and consumerism in the developing world.
 Even though scarcity is fundamentally more important than noticeability,
 we argue that scarcity merely allows status competitions to develop.
 The factors that affect status competitions are indeed beyond scarcity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
With that admission, we decide on the three degrees of scarcity that we
 can associate to an item - and define a fundamental assumption to justify
 the existence of status competitions arising out of the scarcity of a commodity.
 We assume that the richer half of the society invariably indicates higher
 status (than lower) and has access to more facilities (than less).
 In other words, when individuals are ranked by permanent income, scarcity
 is always faced by the lower half of the society.
 With this assumption, status competitions would occur when people with
 lower income would want to achieve higher status.
 The conspicuous items in this view are objects that indicate achieving
 what's scarce.

The method with percentile thresholds briefly described in the section

 etc.) and ii) affordability.
 If the item is affordable and not available, it would be classified as
 scarce.
 Severe(1) scarcities - which would be a physical scarcities in a Hirschian
 sense - would create minimal status competitions while under medium scarcity(2)
, status competition would thrive.
 For items that are not scarce(3) at all (i.e.
 affordable by all and available to all) would not allow status competitions
 to develop.

Methods to measure Visibility 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The direct way of measuring visibility is to find an evidence of visibility
 in the comomdities.
 Most studies have relied on their own visibility surveys.
 In absence of such a survey, one can verify commodities from public media
 - e.g.
 advertisements or social media traffic.
 These methods have not been pursued at this stage in the study.

Consumption percentiles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The differences between amounts spent by the lowest and higher percentile
 of spenders of a particular commodity are expected to be higher when a
 commodity is a status-good than when it is of common utility.
 The illustrations show non-zero log-level expenditure on a few commodities
 when the lower (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

) percentile of the consumption of the commodity is ignored.
 Ignoring the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile of the consumption of a visible commodity is equivalent to treating
 the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 percentile expenditure as non-visible consumption (If we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=10\%$
\end_inset

 for electricity, then bottom 10% percentile of the consumption on electricity
 would be consider non-visible and anything above that level would be considered
 visible).
 The plots of log-expenditures are shown with rising 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (starting with the lowest percentile 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to lowest non-zero log-level of consumption of the commodity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
For a good that is not positional, one expects that the consumers from lower
 and higher quantiles of total expenditure (x-axis) would consume similar
 amounts of the good (y-axis).
 For a positional good, the consumers spending higher expenditure on the
 good would lean towards consumers with higher total expenditure.
 This does not indicate signaling in any way - but tests only whether a
 commodity is consumed uniformly amongst those with lower and higher total
 expenditure outlays (this is rather a measure of sarcity of the item than
 of its visibility).
 Choosing different thresholds (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta)$
\end_inset

 provides a a control on the degree to which a certain commodity can be
 included in our conspicuous consumption basket.
 Instead of asking whether marriage spending is visible or not - for example
 - the test asks if only the richer consumers can afford a significant expenditu
re on marriage (while varying the degree of visibility attached to spending
 on marriage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In the data from Tanzania, while top 56% of consumers show spending on rice,
 electricity appears to be a luxury when only top 22 % of consumers spend
 on it.
 This does not necessitate that a higher consumption of electricity indicates
 higher status but a higher threshold for electricity certainly indicates
 its physical scarcity which may permit status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Not all scarce objects can be indicative of status - we often need some
 judgment to decide which products may indicate status signaling.
 A survey accomplishes this by ranking all products as viewed by its respondents.
 It must also be noted that visibility or positional signaling of a commodity
 is hardly orthogonal to major expenditure categories.
 The usual arguments of additive utilities cannot hold for conspicuous consumpti
on.
 In other words, if walnut turns out to be of visible significance (ranked
 high in the consumers' perception of visibility in the survey) then one
 can no longer talk about the combined utility of food and visible items
 (walnut is both a food item and a visible good)

\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Techniques for Panel data analysis can be used on a population that is observed
 for a sufficiently long time to provide effects of changing incomes, price
 variations on the consumer preferences.
 A significant degree of demand analysis from panel data comes out of the
 Slutsky equation approach (e.g.
 the well-known AIDS model - a particular version of the Rotterdam model).
 With no time-series data, on the other hand, one relies on price-variations
 within the cross-section and interpretations of commodity-elasticities
 (instead of effects of changing income on a monitored household).
 A few commonly adopted techniques are discussed below.

 For these to be consistent, one arrives at the cost function:

 varieties.
 The quality elasticities obtained in a similar fashion for alcohol, fruits
 and meat in Tanzania, show significant differences in quality elasticities

We extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 With large size of families (40% of housesholds have sze 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 Further, the frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk
 purchases increase.
 We can probably estimate the number of rooms as a proxy of storage space
 - but store and consume is itself a consumption pattern.
 This may happen more when the closest market is distant from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost from( public transport)
 is quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs could be because the market as described in the survey is never
 visited (or it doesn't exist in the immediate region).
 We would assume that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country
 - which might be sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into
 account - we should be able to account regional differences or household
 factors (such as household size) in this habit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
To perform this analysis, we have the expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months.
 This can overestimate the purchases for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservab
le in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 We don't know if distance is a parameter of significance - if it is then
 we can look for proxies.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why this percentage would change within a region within
 a period of a few years.
 Assuming this we can assume that stockpilers in any two regions A, B with
 populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers respectively (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers (another
 assumption).
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region (and are not
 captured by region dummies) then we should observe fixed difference in
 all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some regions do seem to have clusters - but these clusters could arise
 out of many household factors.
 We need to study the combined effect of the imaginary stockpiler dummy
 to test whether such a difference exists.
 Given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{skincreamconsu}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that
 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more of such quantities.

Effect of occupation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Income data in LSMS is not available for all the surveyed households.
 This may indicate the presence of informal sector in Tanzania.
 A few occupations in the survey are neither well defined nor are truly
 an indicator of total income.
 The presence of categories like unpaid-family-work and of individuals with
 no-primary-job getting a significant income from their secondary occupations
 makes the task of associating the primary occupation of the household head
 with her income rather difficult (i.e.
 occupation - which is available for all household heads cannot be used
 as a proxy of household income - which is not available for all households
 in the survey).
 Grouping the occupations into fewer categories than in the survey (by putting
 paid/unpaid family work and agriculture under the same category for example)
 allows for the smoothening of the effect of individual occupations and
 may serve as a proxy of socioeconomic classesTHez in the country.
 Without or without this grouping, the effect of occupation has been found
 significant on the consumption of scarce commodities.
 The results are shown in Table

Effect of Education Level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
One of the claims to be evaluated on the LSMS data is whether education
 has a significant effect on visible consumption.
 If the education level of NA is considered as none (for nearly 30% of the
 recorded individuals), then highest education level of the household held
 is found quite significant for many commodities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Effect of Immigration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
With a significant migration from rural areas, one of the claims to be tested
 is whether those resident in the community spend less on positional consumption.
 While this does seem be to be a significant factor, it has a weaker effect
 than age or household size (which is to be further split as number of children
 and the number of members minus the number of children) .

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Urbanization Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Most of Tanzania appears to be sparsely populated with little access to
 basic services and it is likely that the administrative classifications
 of rural-urban areas do not reflect the consumer markets so well.
 Still, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is_rural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dummy is found significant for house-rent and electricity (since most of
 rural Tanzania does not have electricity - See Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:no_instruments_reg1"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
If one were to use a dummy for accessible markets (created using the distance
 from the surveyed household location to the closest daily market ) - the
 effect of such a dummy is not so significant on positional consumption.
 The region dummies - on the other hand - are found to have more significance
 - indicating regional disparities for conspicuous consumption in the country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Population density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Population density is a crude measure for crowding in the cities.
 The regions with higher population density do have a slight effect on consumpti
on of scarce commodities.
 It is hoped that a urban/rural dummy created by classifying districts based
 on their population densities (or at a finer granularity than regional
 levels) may give a more detailed view on the effect of population density
 on conspicuous consumption.

\begin_layout Subsubsection

Services as Visible Consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
One of the interesting observations in the Vindex survey (Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) is the clustering of services and products.
 It is found that services tend to be less 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the Western consumer world.
 The clustering might not be as clear-cut in the developing world - where
 social stratification is severe and many services are contractual (non-monetary
).
 The socio-cultural barriers might have an effect through access to services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Towards that claim, English education as a control parameter is found quite
 significant for positional consumption.
 Those who identify themselves as English speakers tend to spend more on
 scarce commodities.
 This indicates that English education may be quite scarce - and while it
 isn't reflected in the consumer expenditure market data so easily - it's
 likely to play a role in status competitions.

While a commodity for private consumption (e.g.
 skin-cream or hobby-equipment in the LSMS data) might have an appeal for
 everyone - whether it signals high-status or not is a social psychological
 concern and cannot be assessed from the household survey by itself.
 In the absence of a visibility survey (asking the respondents how much
 they notice a product and whether they associate the product with high-income
 or not), one may still continue the discussion of the potential conspicuous
 value of items by looking at how scarce the item is (based on the percentile
 of consumers of the commodity).
 This is akin to repeating the analysis of visible expenditure with a given
 commodity as the only constituent of the visibility basket.
 The percentile of consumers using a given commodity (e.g.
 top 22% for electricity) and the slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(commodity-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $log(total-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 can tell us if richer sections of society spend more on a certain commodity
 and if the poorer sections of society consume the chosen commodity at all
 (the commodities chosen in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 are those where this slope is significant).
 The regression based on data prepared from the last step attempts to calculate
 the coefficients of the following equation:

 A column in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 also suggests the percentile of consumers using the commodity (electricity
 for example is used amongst those having top 22% of total expenditure).
 The usage of commodities such as skincream and other-personal-products
 (shampoos, razors etc.) are widespread compared with sports or hobby equipment
 and electricity.
 For commodities that are rare and consumed only amongst the richer sections
 of the society (those with higher total expenditure) the effect of English
 literacy is significant.
 Similarly, hsize has a significant effect on both educational expense and
 personal products (using number of children instead of hsize could provide
 better association with education expense).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
We cannot claim from the results that the population spends more on status
 commodities than education.
 What we can claim however, is that electricity is more scarce than education.
 Further, in areas where food is expensive, spending on marriage reduces
 - particularly by the occupations that may bring higher incomes.
 This marks a preference towards industrial goods in the urban (expensive)
 areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Another observation that can possibly help in modeling scarcity is that
 scarcity of items seems to occur in clusters of objects.
 Carpets-rugs require a certain housing status and access to English depends
 on region.
 Similarly, many hobby equipments may require access to electricity etc.
 The clustering of these items essentially point to the urban-rural differences
 in the country.

A model for Utility and Status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The concept of status is rather non-trivial and has characteristics of a
 feedback system in the long-run (status may yield income through social
 barriers but requires income to be acquired).
 The Ireland model used in the literature treats status-signaling as purchasing
 of visible and non-visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

.
 In the Ireland model, the combined utility for every consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $U=F(f(v,w),s)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)$
\end_inset

 is the private utility of the consumer and status 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be an increasing function of inference of others - 
\begin_inset Formula $s=f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - with 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 denoting visual consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 - the consumption that is not directly observable.
 Every consumer thus optimizes the combined private and visible utility.
 A practical consideration in the model is the separation between visible
 and non-visible consumption - a boundary that requires a socio-culutral
 judgment and has been drawn using consumer surveys in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
What research in the developing markets further points out is that the parameter
 of combined utility in a simplified model - (
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)\cdot f(v,w)+a\cdot f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - can vary for different sections of society.
 A slight adjustment of the model may be to add another parameter that indicates
 the consumer's social class.
 This may be relevant in the developing world where social status is yielded
 through social barriers.
 Sections of society that are endowed with a higher status capital may be
 in less of a need to purchase commodities of visible consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In the analysis of LSMS data on Tanzania so far, urban/rural differences
 have significance in the consumption of scarce commodities.
 There are two ways to incorporate this into a model of signaling - one
 is to consider these household characteristics as a social class of consumers
 so that different visible sensitivities for social classes is noted.
 The other is to consider these characteristics as part of conspicious consumpti
on in the long-run.
 For example, English literacy seems to have correlation with the consumption
 of certain scarce products in Tanzania.
 In the model of scarcity, English literacy (along with urban residence
 and other characteristics significant for consumption of scarce commodities)
 would be seen as a status commodity (capital) that is acquired through
 spending on education or migration (or other relevant commodities).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
A Word of Caution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Notice that one needs to be careful while drawing conclusions based on consumpti
on of commodities that are themselves selected based on the percentiles
 of consumption levels.
 The threshold method that we use to select scarce commodities (that are
 likely to be visible) - considers items that i) are accessible by no more
 than 50% of the consumers and ii) have their expenditure rising with permanent
 income.
 These are - by definition - items that the rich are more likely to afford.
 We cannot select items that the only richer section of society indulges
 in and claim that people spending on these selected items indicate higher
 status.
 Such a claim is only a restatement of the high permanent income and says
 nothing more substantial than that the richer population sections signal
 higher status.
 It would be a fallacy to associate visible consumption with household character
istics by only associating household characteristics with permanent income.
 The threshold method that we use only measures the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scarcity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the item (e.g.
 electricity is more scarce than food) - not status or visibility per se
 - which involve some socio-cultural judgement.
 That scarcity itself has an indirect effect on status competitions cannot
 be denied - but this effect is not measured by the threshold method of
 classifying alone.

A model for scarcity and congestion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In recent decades, the urban settlements in Africa have seen massive overpopulat
ion and development of the services sector.
 The differences in urban-rural lifestyles have increased.
 The scarcity of services and of industrial goods (which would be a necessity
 in the Western world) seem evidently sparse in the developing countries
 (a claim that is verified by data on Tanzania).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
A relevant question amidst these developments is whether a consumer prefers
 a larger house over installation of electricity or not.
 As a commodity, electricity is both scarce and visible - as it opens up
 more lifestyle choices.
 A survey detailed in the next sections aims to test the presence of a preferenc
e for electricty (and other scarce goods) - but as is, the data suggests
 significant urban-rural differences across regions in Tanzania.
 In a Hirschian sense, a congestion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"

\end_inset

 is likely to exist for electricity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
A general view on scarcity would allow us to classify the commodities based
 on their scarcity and quantify the urban-rural differences better.
 The survey detailed in next sections may further help measure the impact
 of such scarcities on consumer preferences.
 It is noted that many of the items are scarce together (carpets and housing-sta
tus, electricty and hobby equipments, etc.) .
 It is through such denial of goods and services that status perceptions
 develop.
 A simple view of observed scarcities can be provided by a directed graph
 of items for classification - where a node is an item and points to other
 nodes/items that it denies (which themselves can be formed with items that
 deny other items and so and so forth).
 For example, electricity can be a node in this graph with connections to
 equipments and electronics but no connection to food items.
 The disconnected nodes in the graph - would be least likely to be affected
 by another unreachable node in the graph.
 The criteria of connections (denials) would be determined by statistical
 significance e.g.
 rice and walnuts appear would not be scarce together if one of them is
 available and affordable by both higher and lower quantiles of permanent
 income of society.

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While the visibility surveys (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

) attempt to study how consumption on certain commodities may signal status,
 the goal of the proposed game is to characterise environments under which
 the perceptions of a higher-status may develop.
 The game attempts to emulate i) the consumer market and ii) the mechanism
 through which status may be assigned within a group of consumers.
 It therefore relies on participants playing the dual role of a consumer
 and status-observer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The activities of purchasing and assigning status are separate in the game.
 Since a simulated purchase performed by the participants in the game (given
 a list of commodities, prices and outlay) is quite likely to deviate from
 their real world purchases and their real needs, the participants are instead
 asked what additional items they would purchase for a given a basket of
 commodities that they already possess (using a cumulative voting scheme
 that emulates selection of commodities in a market - see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Purchasing_Mechanism"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The second part of the game emulates status assignment - where participants
 assign a score of status and effectiveness each to 3 (or more) other participan
ts in the game by looking at the quantities of the item categories possessed
 and purchased by the latter.
 The judgment of status in the real world does not involve direct observance
 of prices and thus it is only the quantity of the identified items consumed
 or already possessed that matters in the status-assignment part of the

 The end-goal of the game is to purchase a basket most desired by others
 - the winner achieves this goal by purchasing commodities of her choice
 that are most desirable by everyone and are indicative of a rank higher
 than everyone else in the game.

 in a way that truly represents their needs.
 Hence, instead of asking the respondent how they'll spend the given outlay

 spend the additional 100 dollars for a given 1000 dollars of outlay (or
 more) value of items that they already have stocked up.

 is made of non-positional items, the participants choose 3 items from a
 mix of non-positional items and positional items - given the 10% extra
 outlay.
 Since all participants cannot be assumed to be equally numerate, the game
 uses a scheme similar to cumulative voting - where 10 virtual coins are
 provided to the participant and the participant is asked to distribute
 the coins amongst a set of available items (both positional and non-positional).
 The provided outlay in the game (number of coins) may vary for participants
 - in proportion to the income distribution that is observed in the relevant
 consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS for Tanzania).

 game ensures that all participants have reasonably similar consumer universe.

Constraints and Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The game attempts to measure status and consumption with respect to high
 asset ownership, social class or familial responsibility.
 Since players choose between physical needs and positional needs in the
 game, a different circumstance is likely to affect their choice and hence
 their perceived status.
 The game presents a precondition to the player - indicating high asset
 ownership, a chosen social class or a familial liability.
 For example, to test a participant's choice between food and electricity,
 the game can present a large family as a constraint, and record the choice
 between spending more on food vs installing electricity.
 The game thus measures indirect effects of reward or constraints on status
 by allowing participants to gauge the suitability of a participant's choice
 in the status game in the presence of constraints (familial) or rewards
 (asset-related).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Notice that the constraint variable is only planned to be binary in the
 current scheme i.e.
 it is either a reward or a liability (when present).
 The two values are expected to have an opposite affect on the purchase
 of new items.
 Admittedly, the binary values of constraints vs rewards circumvent the
 difficulty in comparisons between disparate needs of the consumers - e.g.
 a large family, senior member or a social event (e.g.
 marriage/funeral).
 While a multivalued variable (if adopted) can potentially provide better
 insights into the relative effects of these several types constraints,
 the goal of the current exercise is to test for a direct effect of constraints
 on status (rather than relative effect of the various possible constraints).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Status ranking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The status-ranking activity involves a student assigning a status score
 by looking at i) what the other participant with a given income level does
 with the extra outlay and ii) what the participant already possesses.
 In the ranking scheme, the participants provide a score on effectiveness
 as well as status to all the other (3 or more) participants observed.
 Notice that in presence of constraints specified in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

, regardless of whether one is selfish or not, a participant would tend
 to penalise someone else who she thinks is going to be more selfish than
 herself.
 Since the game provides a way to penalize selfishness by status ranks,
 the participants are discouraged from indicating status through overspending
 on positional items.
 The penalty for not caring for a sick parent may be huge in the society
 but so can be the penalty for being stingy.
 Similarly, while some may want to indicate wealth by buying a watch they
 may also fear disrespect for not taking care of a sick family member.
 The scores on effectiveness and status are thus not only a way to discourage
 the consumer from limiting the unrealistic purchases in the simulated purchasin
g part of the game, they also track the effect of the externalities such
 as sickness or age (measured through the binary variable discussed in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
While consumers try to maximise their utility by purchasing more items for
 a given limited outlay - they also manage their prestige by letting others
 have a better opinion of themselves.
 The status game can thus be seen as an enhanced version of the survey that
 asks people to imagine a neighbour who spends more than them on a chosen
 commodity (used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

).
 The proposed game attempts to measure how consumers might act given a certain
 circumstances while both status and welfare (effectiveness score can be
 seen as a proxy of concern for others) become part of the payoff function
 in the game.

Welfare and Status competitions

\begin_layout Standard

The solution of this game for a set of rational players remains a pending
 exercise in this study.
 The key motivation for the analysis at this point is that fundamentally
 all social welfare concerns are concerns of Pareto optimality.
 Moreover, the payoff function for effectiveness in the game is meant to
 be a proxy for welfare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
With Pareto optimality in mind, more spending on education, health seems
 desirable - but it may be become distant for consumers due to their immediate
 needs - whether positional or non-positional.
 A comparison with what is observed in consumption data versus what is observed
 about positional consumption in games can provide some insight into the
 social status that can influence the desired welfare equilibrium.

Policy implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The discussion so far leans towards permitting status competitions rather
 than attempting to tax or control them.
 This is in line with the suggestions offered by Robert H Frank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 favouring a non-monetary market of stauses only so that status games (which
 are a necessity) do not overlap with the market for real goods.
 Due to structural reasons of the modern economy, advertising efforts can
 turn a social scarcity into a physical scarcity (to use the Hirsch's terminolog
y
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"

\end_inset

).
 A profit-driven industry and the advertising pursued by the companies tend
 to increase the status competition for a commodity.
 Instead of letting status competitions modify the distribution of that
 physical goods through competition (and thus do little to avoid the problem
 of physical scrarcities in the developing countries), policy can attempt
 to provide status-games in a world of non-necessity items - in some ways
 to diffuse the status competitions in the society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In poor and non-pecuniary societies, the desire to become rich or the benefit
 of inheriting money and education is often less reachable.
 Status and money translate into social securities in unstructured societies.
 These may well be detected in the countries in Africa - but limited data
 on household characteristics in Tanzania (related to ethnicity or religion)
 have prevented us from such an analysis for Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The question that we seek the answer for in the context of Tanzania (or
 another developing country) is whether the expenditure on high-status or
 scarce items (an analysis similar to one conducted by Prais Houthakker
 for expensive and cheap tea varieties amongst social classes in the UK
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerFamilySurvey"

\end_inset

) - is actually more desirable than on housing and education.
 The designed experiment intends to find answer to this question.
 If the answer is indeed the former, then it makes sense to limit the status
 competitions through policy to support status competitions on non-essential
 items (possibly by introducing brand differentiation).
 Attaching glamour to education, healthcare and food items may help consumers
 prioritize their needs.

Price Changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The literature has not used panel data analysis in the context of conspicuous
 consumption.
 While an influence of rising prices can complicate the analysis of visible
 consumption indicators, the insights from demand elasticities are essential
 to understanding the relative effect of status-related consumption against
 other commodities.
 Higher price of food items may suppress consumption on food - but one cannot
 answer whether an increase in price of food suppresses its consumption
 more than it suppresses consumption of non-food items or not - without
 an estimation of demand elasticities.
 Such details of consumption patterns are basket-dependent and are not accessibl
e without a record of prices of all types of items in the basket.
 Unfortunately, a lack of prices for non-food items in the LSMS prevent
 this much desired time-series analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Even though an analysis on non-food prices is inaccessbile with the unavailabili
ty of price data in most consumption surveys (e.g.
 LSMS), a time-series analysis based on food prices alone can provide insights
 into the pressures on food consumption.
 Using historical prices on calorie consumption in India, Deaton and Jean
 Dreze point out that the overall calorie consumption has declined while
 the total outlay has increased in India (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"

\end_inset

).
 The change in positional value of food - determined by price differentiation
 in the market and scarcity - can potentially help explain some of this
 decline.
 While such a decline is reported to be less in the case of sub-Saharan
 African countries than in India, the regional differences within the country
 could be explained by the change of food's position in the consumer universe
 (i.e.
 the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard

Congestion - a related phenomenon - is subject to demand and supply for
 a particular commodity and can be measured.
 If we were to consider food, for example, a limited supply and overpopulation
 can increase competition.
 Similarly, for entertainment, censorship and introduction of internet can
 create new competitions (congestion).
 For housing, new constructions and overpopulation can cause congestion.
 These are commodity-specific instances and a focus on selected items may
 be the only way to test whether the changes in consumption patterns for
 the chosen commodity are explained by new scarce items and the competition
 caused for them.
 The data from Tanzania - so far - only seems to point that availability
 of services in urban and rural area can potentially cause some congestion
 (competitions for scarce items).

Scarcity is interpreted in terms of availability and affordability in the
 study.
 The geographical regions may need to be understood in terms of scarcity.
 Further, population density and migration data may provide better insights
 in the interplay of food and non-food consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
It is noted that in certain areas in Tanzania - prices for food vary a lot
 more than they do in others.
 This is a phenomenon that varies from commodity to commodity.
 For example, the prices for onions and sugar don't vary so much by area
 code as they do for meat and chicken.
 The regions Dar-es-salaam, Mbeya mwanza, Mjini/Magharini unguja stand out
 for higher prices for multiple items.
 In a preliminary analysis, a indicator dummy for these regions is found
 significant - but it is also noted that these areas are urban settlements
 where electricity is available and population is significantly high (See
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:popreg-reg2-simple2"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Certain food items for example, have more price-differences overall than
 others - rice (husked), maize(grain), sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, groundnut
s(shelled), goat meat, chicken and canned milk correspond to numerous (>4)
 region-codes where they're reportedly sold in different prices ranges.
 While it is tempting to claim that price differences in the market indicate
 that there is more price-differentiation and possibly more competition
 - one needs to consider the overall scarcity of the commodity (the percentiles
 of the commodity expenditure in the threshold method) as well as the preference
 for the item amongst the rich (measured by higher expenditure with income)
 for the item to be considered a status-signaling item.
