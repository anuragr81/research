The aspirational consumption in base of pyramid countries - which constitute
 the poorer two-thirds of the world's population - has recorded a significant
 increase in recent years.
 The consumption continues to rise for the base of pyramid consumers while
 it already remains proportionately higher in comparison to the consumers
 of richer economies.
 To help answer whether such a rise may be subject to a leveling effect
 seen in developed economies or not, we examine the determinants of aspirational
 consumption amidst wealth inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa.

 The presented thesis focus on two instances of consumption - food quality
 and education - exploring the role of household incomes and regional inequaliti
es in two sub-Saharan African economies.
 The first two empirical chapters investigate food quality and education
 expenses using consumer survey data from Tanzania and Nigeria - while a
 final theoretical chapter comments on whether the aspirational consumption
 may continue to rise with income gap in the developing economies or not.
 The three chapters draw a set of independent conclusions on the role of
 wealth and social factors for consumption in developing economies.
 The first empirical chapter observes that household wealth does influence
 food quality in Tanzania and that

, alongside with availability of electricity in the country, may have a
 segregating effect on food quality.
 The next empirical chapter revisits the significance of effects of

 considers an intertemporal framework where status goals of the consumer
 are treated the same as her economic goals.
 Factoring in the probabilistic returns in a setting of a hierarchy of positions
 that consumers are able to move between, the conditions for a long-term
 equilibrium described in the chapter reveal that the positional contests
 can become uncompetitive as the income inequality rises.

%[PITCH] : We talk about how consumption can be necessary.
 Food quality is merely more meats.
 Education is just urbanisation and development.
 Whether it is necessary or not - is important because literature says it's
 just the waste based on social differences and taste-transfer.
 Instead of relying on tropes, we depend on income differences.

 The empirical studies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and elsewhere seem less
 concerned with why certain items are to be treated as aspirational.
 The expenditure on education - for instance - is often treated as necessities
 but the literature also finds rent-seeking from educational degrees and
 notes certain downsides of a notion of eliteness associated with education
 in SSA

 Similarly, while higher quality in clothing or personal products are commonly
 interpreted as wasteful consumption (

The presented study thus focuses on the extent to which higher consumption
 in sub-Saharan Africa could be considered necessary by surveying its variation
 with respect to permanent income differences and regional inequalities
 in the economy.
 It then discusses long-term implications of the reported rise in demand
 for aspirational items in the economies of SSA (

We find that a clarity on the notion of necessities is of extreme importance
 in the context of countries in SSA - due to several observations that have
 been made on social issues exerting influence on the macroeconomy.
 More particularly, the empirical literature attributes compensatory consumption
 to the long-term power differences among social classes in the region (

who explain the role of race in conspicuous consumption using asset level

 We also investigate the role of extreme regional differences in SSA - in
 light of issues with urban-rural classification that have been highlighted
 in the literature (

Our main finding has been that while high expenditure for certain items
 may be limited to those with higher permanent income, the urbanisation-related
 changes have an effect of reducing the role of permanent income on expenditure
 for some items.
 More specifically, we find that high quality is influenced by higher income
 for food in Tanzania.
 But comparing education expenses between two economies Tanzania and Nigeria,
 the role of permanent income is found weaker in the more urbanised economy.
 This seems related with the phenomenon of snob items becoming bandwagon
 items that has been discussed in the literature (

 We remark also that urbanisation effects are not without the role of extreme
 regional differences - which also arise due to urbanisation.
 Using a theoretical approach, we then comment on how long-term socio-economic
 differences may limit competitions for status in an economy

 in demand for food quality in Tanzania, we focus on demand substitution
 in quality across food commodities in the economy.
 Comparing effects of permanent income and that of prices of food commodities,
 we find a higher price-based quality in meats and fruits to be aligned
 with the income disparities as well as with the availability of electricity
 in Tanzania - suggesting that the access to urban amenities also significantly
 influences consumption of higher quality food items in the economy.

 While richer consumers tend to avail better dietary diversity, the link
 between poverty and poorer dietary diversity isn't explained by lower permanent
 income alone.
 This is primarily because dietary diversity isn't about insufficiency of
 food for the consumer.
 In the context of SSA, it is in fact the poverty status of the household
 - rather than insufficiency of food - that has been linked with poorer
 dietary diversity

A fundamental contention that we maintain for implications of permanent
 income effects on food demand and rise in consumption is that higher quality
 in any given food category may not be an instance of excessive consumption.
 Firstly, this is because the notion of food-related basic needs spans more
 than the minimal calorific intake required for survival

- allowing for consumption of quality at the cost of its quantity for any
 particular food category to comprise of basic necessities.
 Secondly, even if consumers are compelled to increase quality in certain
 food categories rather than others (for reasons unobserved), it must require
 specific normative criteria to treat the quality substitution in a particular
 food category with that in another as excessive consumption.
 Instead of determining whether the quality consumed is excessive or not,
 our focus in the chapter remains on assessing whether consumption of higher
 quality is narrowed down to specific food categories relevant for food
 diversity or not and on explaining what that may imply for consumption
 trends.
 While we do use the FAO-specified nutrition categories (

) to help assess the extent to which higher quality in specific categories
 may be aligned with recommended food diversity, the FAO-categories are
 used only to provide a qualitative view of variation in quality while avoiding
 any particular judgment on what is considered necessary for the consumer.
 The empirical goal of the chapter is thus limited to testing whether higher
 permanent income results in a higher demand for quality across FAO-provided
 food categories in Tanzania or not.
 The chapter discusses the implications for aspirational consumption of
 factors other than permanent income - such as the role of availability
 of basic amenities and urbanisation.
 It argues that while high quality consumption may rise in future, a segregation
 of food demand based on high or low permanent income may depend on how
 newer food items are introduced in the market.

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of variation in food quality relies on a robust framework for
 quality in demand - where a measure for quality across commodities (such
 as fruits, fat, meats-proteins etc.) upholds the theoretical restrictions
 imposed by aggregation of demand across various goods (such as coconut,
 mango etc.
 that may be classified within a commodity:fruits) that are part of a commodity
 group (such as fruits).
 More specifically, the method follows the restrictions implied due to the
 Hick's commodity theorem (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hicksvaluecapital1946,DeatonEconConsumer,NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) which requires the physical quantities of goods consumed to be weighted
 by unchanging (relative) prices of the constituent goods before the quantities
 can be aggregated into the demand for group whose quality is measured.
 Thus, the quality of fruits as commodity - for example - can be evaluated
 only as long as the goods - coconut, mango etc.
 that may constitute the fruits commodity - exhibit a stable relative price-stru
cture.
 To avoid confusion in the terminology associated goods and quality, we
 use the nomenclature provided by

\begin_layout Standard
The particular theoretical approach is important for our analysis of demand
 for quality due to two reasons.
 First, the approach is preferable over an arbitrary or intuitive aggregation
 of quality from groups that does not follow the aggregation restrictions
 in a demand equation.
 Such restrictions may limit our ability to talk about substitution in quality
 across commodity groups - 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

which is the core part of our assessment of how quality availed of certain
 food categories may be higher than others
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Second, a robust aggregation based on market-prices also helps circumvent
 problems with unavailability of detailed prices of each good (by relying
 on the prices of one good in each commodity group) and the measurement
 issues arising out of use of unit-prices(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary criterion of grouping the demand from goods consumed into a
 commodity group using the approach is a stable relative price-structure
 of market prices that are available in the consumption survey
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The prices observed in local markets are those in the district where the
 household - whose consumption is recorded for budget shares and quality
 measures - is located.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A classification of food items into commodities for which quality metrics
 are calculated is thus undertaken using past observed-market prices of
 all goods available in the survey alone - where a quality metric is associated
 with each food commodity such that the constituent goods of every commodity
 (which quality is calculated for) move together in terms of their annual
 prices

This is a departure from the unit-value approaches where average expenditure
 itself is considered as a price-control.
 It needs to be emphasised also that the groups of food-commodities over
 which quality is evaluated are determined based on a similar change in
 prices (rather than the prices themselves i.e.
 the classification does not place all high-price items in one group and
 low-price groups in another).
 
\begin_inset ERT

 The condition of a stable relative prices structure (due to Hicks Commodity
 Theorem) drives a clustering of relative price changes across all goods
 for food in the survey that we describe in

 The FAO categories are then used as the nutritional basis upon which we
 assess how the food demand may have higher quality in certain commodity
 groups vs others.
 Thus, the commodity groups obtained from the clustering are further divided
 based on the twelve FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
 Nations) categories - (i) cereals, (ii) vegetables, (iii) fruits, (iv)
 meat, (v) eggs (vi) fish and other sea foods (vii) legumes, nuts and seeds,
 (viii) milk and milk products (ix) oil and fats, (x) sweets (xi) spices,

 The direct use of market-observed prices also has the advantage that it
 avoids using unit-values (price-deflator) as price controls in our analysis.
 More specifically, the market-prices - used as controls in the analyses
 - avoid the measurement errors that arise with the use of unit-values (which
 approximate the price of an item with the average of item expenditure divided
 by its quantity consumed).

It is worth highlighting inferring qualities for commodity-groups - based
 on an arbitrary or intuitive grouping criteria - may not follow separability
 in demand or other restrictions of demand analysis either (

 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 from across items (or goods) within a commodity group (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 on consumer demand (

 The measure also avoids intuitive grouping of goods into commodities -

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than using the stable relative price-structure associated with a commodity
 (fat, cereals etc.), the quality metric for every household depends on the
 measurement of quantities of high vs low-price variants (goods) consumed
 within a food commodity (e.g.
 the quantities consumed of wheat, rice, maize for quality in cereals commodity).
 Considering a commodity-group of cereals comprising of rice, maize and
 wheat, for example, maize would contribute to lower quality of cereals-commodit
y than wheat and rice if the prices (per-kg) of wheat and rice are higher
 than that of maize.
 Other than the quality metric thus calculated for every food commodity
 (such as cereals), the budget shares per household for each of these commoditie
s are used as dependent variables in the system of equations used for an
 AIDS estimation.
 In order to provide a comparison with a disaggregated view of goods consumed
 (

The results indicate that higher permanent income (measured as total expenditure
) is associated with higher demand for meat-related proteins and fruits
 in particular.
 Further, the effect is made stronger due to regional inequalities relating
 to variations in urbanisation levels in Tanzania.
 More specifically, electricity being sparsely available in the urban areas
 of Tanzania suggests strong effects of both electricity availability and
 urbanisation levels on price-based quality (meats and fruits in particular)

One of the earliest approaches for measurement of quality had been to treat
 it as a separate good (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerQuality1952"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) - thus decomposing the quality price elasticity of demand (quantity purchased)
 into a quantity price elasticity of expenditure on quality and an income
 elasticity of quality measure.
 The treatment of quality as a separate good has been widely used ever since
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 A common example of the approach is a simple repackaging method (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) - which interprets demand for a high-quality good as multiples of lower
 quality goods.
 More specifically, the demand for goods with a certain price using the
 repackaging approach is viewed in terms of a base-price and a quality parameter
 - the implicit assumption being that the variants in every category are
 perfect substitutes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most empirical studies, however, the perfect substitution turns out
 to be a stringent requirement since the variation in quality among goods
 within a commodity may be often extreme.
 As an example, even though quality consumed of electricity under energy
 commodity may be higher than that of kerosene, the substitution between
 electricity and kerosene may in fact be little - thus making it difficult
 to justify a view of a demand for electricity in terms of the units of
 kerosene consumed
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While one may address this issue with use of an energy-budget (calories),
 the unavailability of quantities consumed or prices in the consumption
 data limit wider applications of such an approach.

 Nevertheless, simple-repackaging does turn out to be appropriate in the
 context of cost-of-living index problems where a substitution is implied

\begin_layout Standard
Some constraints on either consumer preferences or prices are needed - when
 perfect substitution isn't possible - so as to measure the quality using
 both quantities consumed and prices of goods within a commodity.
 As such, the problem of measuring quality of a commodity comprising of
 multiple goods is that of assigning a quality metric to the entire commodity
 group using the a combination of quantities consumed of the goods within
 the commodity group at prices known for every good.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 explains, the approach to measurement of food quality in such a manner
 must either assume weakly separable preferences with homothetic within-group
 preferences (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CoxWohlgenant1986,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) or a stable price-structure in a commodity group with a base-price associated
 with the commodity.
 The current chapter opts for the latter approach since it not only imposes
 fewer restrictions on the consumer preferences but also makes use of the
 market prices rather than the unit-prices
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The unit-prices are the total expenditure divided by quantities consumed
 that are used prices as controls in a regression with budget, quantity

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is worth emphasising that the homotheticity of within-group preferences
 presents
\series bold
 
\series default
an implausible constraint on the demand - since it implies either that the
 within-group income expansion path would be a straight line through the
 origin or that the group composition would remain independent of income
 - conditions.
 Such a restriction on preferences would mean - for example - that the ratio
 of electricity consumed to the kerosene consumed must be the same for both
 rich and poor consumers - a constraint that is unlikely to hold empirically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More formally, consider that in a generic sense, a quality-metric associated
 with a certain commodity (e.g.
 cereals, fat etc.) depends on a grouping of items - which the commodity
 comprises of - subject to certain homogeneity restrictions.
 Given the quantity consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $\{q_{i}\}_{i\in[1,n]}=\{q_{1},q_{2},...,q_{n}\}$

\begin_layout Standard
Such an aggregation requires that the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 groups (commodities) are separable and that the demand for items within
 each group is a homogenous function of the goods it contains (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

).
 The approach followed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - using the sum of physical quantities as measure of demand - requires
 that the homogeneity restriction is put on the household preferences while
 assuming that the within-group preferences are homothetic.
 However, the approach from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 (as well as that from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 heterogeneity in its use of sums of physical quantities as the measure
 of demand (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The Hick's commodity theorem-based approach - which imposes a restriction
 only on prices of goods - does not suffer with the issue as it does not
 impose the stringent homotheticity assumption on preferences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simply put, the approach we adopt in the current chapter prevents considering
 chicken and eggs into one commodity unless the relative price structure
 for the two items (chicken and eggs) does not change.
 No other criteria - arbitrary or otherwise - is followed to group the goods
 into commodities.
 Subject to the restriction, the notion of quality is set to a price-weighted
 quantity (made possible due the availability of market prices) so that
 given the same expenditure, a lower quantity of the composite good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the composite good 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 The commodity groups thus selected are obtained by clustering goods into
 commodity groups based on similar price-changes over the years 2008, 2010,

The issue of unavailability of market prices - often sidelined in many empirical
 studies - has recently gathered some attention (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 As such the measurement of quality is often performed without available
 market prices - by simply averaging over the expenditures (recorded costs)
 of a particular item in a given region (or over the entire population of
 households).
 This so-called unit-value (or price-deflator) method uses the average expenditu
re divided by quantity consumer for all the consumers as prices in the empirical
 analyses (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LazaridisMeatDemand2003,TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a recent implementation).
 While using unit-values as prices may be appropriate for certain empirical
 concerns, the measurement errors introduced by their can be severe and
 difficult to ignore for finer conclusions relating to price and income
 elasticities.
 More specifically, the quantity consumed appearing both in the dependent
 variable (as budget share's numerator) and in the control variable (as
 the denominator for unit-value used as price) cannot be always mitigated
 (see

 The availability of detailed market-observed prices in the survey - therefore

Compared with the measurement of elasticities for every individual good,
 the advantage with the aggregation over commodity groups is that the latter
 does not present the issue of non-consumption of high-quality goods.
 More specifically, if one were to calculate the price elasticities for
 individual goods, an obvious issue that arises is that certain items (particula
rly those with high-quality) might not be consumed at all for a significant
 part of the population.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 address this issue by correcting for non-consumption using the inverse

 also use the unit-values instead of (unavailable) market prices.
 Further, the unit-values obtained from the households using a good are
 used as prices for those who don't consume the good.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While HW approach may be well-suited for comparison of elasticities for
 specific goods (see Appendix II for empirical results using the approach),
 the comparison of quality across multiple commodities is a more appropriate
 interpretation for the overview of quality we seek in the current chapter.
 Since it is much less likely for no goods to be consumed within a broader
 commodity group (fruits-veg, protein etc.) over which the quality measure
 is calculated, the approach with quality aggregated over broader commodity
 groups also circumvents the issue of non-consumption.
 No correction related to non-consumption - as used in HW method - is therefore
 used with our approach that aggregates quality over groups classified with
 homogeneity restrictions (see Section

The variation in quality across multiple food sub-categories is examined
 using the estimated income elasticities for quality using total household
 expenditure as the main explanatory variable and urban-amenities as key
 controls.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KennedyBallardFantaFAO2011"

 The empirical analysis we pursue in the chapter thus addresses the concerns
 related with SES effects on food diversity that have been remarked by many
 empirical studies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RuelDDMethods2003,HatloyFoodVarietySESMali2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In particular, a lower within-country SES measure - whether it be in developed
 or developing economies - often corresponds to less healthy diets (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ManyangaTremblaySESDiets2017"

 In a broad survey across low and middle-income economies, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MayenSESDDlowmidIncomeCountries2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 also find that with the exception of fruits in diet, the residents of urban
 areas - particularly with higher SES - have more calorie intakes as well
 as consumption of protein, fats and vitamins relative to starchy items.
 The exploration of variation in quality in the current chapter is aimed
 at addressing many such concerns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some empirical studies also find a relevance of the availability of amenities
 such as clean water on dietary diversity (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MekuriaWubnehDDFactorsEthiopia2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 A control for amenities such as electricity are also used - other than
 total expenditure as our main explanatory variable - in the current chapter
 to examine the variation in food quality across Tanzania.
 In its particular context, rapid urbanisation seems to have brought challenges
 to food security for the lower-income households in the towns and cities
 within Tanzania - even though the country has managed to maintain a broad
 self-sufficiency in basic food items (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WenbanTNZFoodSecurityUrbanisation2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 The agricultural policy has also focused on a transition from subsistence
 farming to more efficient large-scale rural farming since urban farming
 seems common in the country (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WenbanTNZFoodSecurityUrbanisation2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 As such, a significant number of households dependent on self-farming in
 reportedly rural settings may obfuscate the relationship between urban
 and rural food demand that may be apparent from the conventional models
 for urban-rural migration (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HarrisTodaro1970"

 The control for urban-rural disparities is thus an important one for our
 survey of food quality in the Tanzanian economy.

The measure of quality used in the current chapter for each food commodity
 group (such as fat, cereals etc.) comprising of multiple items (maize, rice,
 wheat etc.
 for cereals etc.) relies on higher weights to high-priced items (rice given
 higher weight than maize based solely on price etc.) within each commodity
 group.
 The commodity groups over which the quality is calculated are based on
 the price-structure restrictions implied by the Hicks Commodity Theorem
 ( more details to follow in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ClassificationGoods"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 A further sub-classification - which does not disrupt the commodities identifie
d based on similarity of price structure - is used to assist interpretation
 from a DD perspective and is guided by FAO categories recommended for food
 diversity.
 It is worth highlighting that instead of measuring an overall food quality
 across all of the food items consumed, we inspect quality only for different
 commodity groups whose constituents satisfy the Hick's commodity theorem.
 The quality across food can thus be seen as a vector associated with the
 set of food commodities.
 As we detail in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the quality vector

 - while the groups based on movements are further subdivided based on FAO
 categories to assist interpretations from a DD perspective.

The main criterion of grouping of food items into commodity groups is the
 co-movement of prices.
 The prices - shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 - are taken from the wave corresponding to years 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014
 in the survey.
 An unsupervised k-means clustering is then used to group the items into
 commodities based on price changes - so that the items within every commodity
 group identified have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

similar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 relative price-changes.
 The groups based strictly on price-movements thus obtained are then split
 into further categories aligned with the FAO recommended categories i.e.
 (i) cereals, (ii) vegetables, (iii) fruits, (iv) meat, (v) eggs (vi) fish
 and other sea foods (vii) legumes, nuts and seeds, (viii) milk and milk
 products (ix) oil and fats, (x) sweets (xi) spices, condiments and beverages
 and (xii) tubers and roots.
 More specifically, the k-means clustering is performed on the relative
 price-changes from available prices.
 Considering beef as an example good, the prices for beef in the years 2008,
 2010, 2012, 2014 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"
plural "false"

\end_inset

) are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{beef}=\{3500.0,4000.0,5000.0,6000.0\}$
\end_inset

 - which correspond to a relative price-change vector 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{beef}=\{\frac{4000}{3500},\frac{5000}{4000},\frac{6000}{5000}\}=\{1.14,1.25,1.2\}$
\end_inset

.
 The relative price-change vectors for all the items (beef, goat, fresh_milk
 etc.) thus obtained are clustered using the k-means method - where the number
 of selected clusters is guided by the within-cluster sum of squared errors
 - an approach commonly used in k-means applications (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pollard1982CLTKmeans"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The classification we use as the basis for commodity groups are arrived
 at by setting the number of clusters to 5 which is when the within-cluster
 sum of squared errors drops to less than unity
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

It is worth emphasising that the partition of commodity groups identified
 from the unsupervised k-means clustering into further sub-groups based
 on FAO categories does not pick goods from disparate clusters into a new
 sub-group.
 Instead, the further partition into sub-groups based on FAO categories
 is based on the observation that that the price-changes of goods within
 sub-groups formed by splitting a particular group identified by clustering
 would also be correlated with each other.
 The groups obtained by the classification based on correlation prices (shown
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceBasedGroups"

 veg and cereals, fruits-fish is split into fruits and fish, startches-fats-comp
lements is split into starches, fats and complements while the categories
 tubers and meatsproteins are retained.
 The resulting categories are therefore i) cereals ii) veg iii) fruits iv)
 meats-proteins v) fish vi) milk vii)fat viii) complements ix) tubers x)

As explained before, the basis for the quality metric associated for every
 commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to the left side of the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:GroupsModified"

) is the Hick's commodity theorem (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Hicksvaluecapital1946"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) which states that a group of goods behave as if they were a single commodity
 so long as the the prices of the group of goods changes in the same proportion.
 Simply put, a constant relative price structure allows us to factor out
 the quantity of the composite commodity consumed from the demand function
 for the variants (goods) within the commodity - allowing the price of quality
 to be interpreted in terms of a composite price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the commodity aggregate 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the price-structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}^{*}$

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 goods with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}=\{p_{i,G}\}_{i\in[1,n]}$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 as the total expenditure on group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, the constant relative price-structure permits us to write the commodity-aggreg
ate specific demand function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(E_{G},p_{G})$
\end_inset

 in terms of the price-structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}^{*}$
\end_inset

The income elasticity of composite quantity

 The essential appeal of aggregation is the simplified view of demand across
 all items.
 Consider for example, if we were to represent demands for items {wheat,
 rice, yam,coconut, eggs, beef, chicken, fish, goat, honey}.
 As such these items would each correspond to a demand function so that
 10 functions describe the demand for all the 10 items.
 The aggregated view allows us to view demands for commodities {carb, protein
 and complements} - where the 10 goods are encompassed in just 3 respective
 functions for the 3 commodity groups.
 A key requirement for the validity of such a quality metric - however -
 is that the prices of goods within the commodity group have a constant
 relative price-structure i.e.
 a relative prices ratio that can be factored out of the observed prices
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "false"

 This condition - due to the Hicks commodity theorem - drives the k-means
 grouping of items described above.

 To explain with particular example goods, consider two pairs of items with
 similar price-movements - with sugar and tea being the first pair that
 have similar price changes (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceBasedGroups"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 Let the second pair be rice and cooking-oil - who also have price changes
 similar to each other (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceBasedGroups"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Notice however that not only do sugar and tea have similar price changes,
 they also have a similar functional sense implied by FAO categories.
 Therefore, they are classified in a group 
\shape italic
complements
\shape default
 in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 Rice and cooking-oil on the other hand are split into two categories based
 on the different functional sense implied by FAO-categories (see Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:GroupsModified"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

).
 Other categories such as meatsproteins, fruits etc.
 are similarly based foremost on price-movement correlations before considering
 the functional sense implied by FAO categories for interpretation from
 a DD perspective.

 Based on the local market-observed prices of the goods within the commodity
 group 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 (such as cereals, fat etc.), the quality metric for the household ensures
 that a household who buys more of the high-priced good within a commodity
 group is viewed as one consuming higher quality of the commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 This is why no quality is considered for chicken, the only good within
 its own commodity group.
 As we've explained in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ClassificationGoods"
plural "false"

To calculate the quality associated with a group 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 (such as the items : beet and goat in the commodity: meatsproteins) that
 have a constant within-group relative price-structure, a base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (meatsproteins) is selected as the minimum price of the items among the
 commodity aggregate constituents (e.g.
 among beef and goat).
 This is based on the approach suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 is then used to assign i) an aggregate-quantity of a composite good (for
 meatsproteins) comprising of quantities consumed of the items constituted
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (beef, goat) and ii) a quality metric corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 ( based on the proportion of goat and beef consumed).
 In other words, with the quantities consumed for beef and goat under meatsprote
ins commodity available to us, a quantity of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meatsproteins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is associated with the particular set of quantities consumed for beef and
 goat.
 The aggregate-quantity of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meatsproteins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is then calculated by relative-prices-weighed averages of beef and goat
 consumed (see details below).
 If beef per unit-weight is cheaper than goat-per-unit-weight, then this
 quality metric would evidently be lower when more beef is consumed for
 the same expenditure.
 This notion of higher-quality is thus based solely on price alone so that
 a more expensive item within the commodity group contribute to higher quality
 of the commodity.

Let's consider an example to illustrate how the measure of quality would
 relate with the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 in the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the group aggregate price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 for a more detailed theoretical discussion).
 Let's say we observe the consumption on goat and beef within a meatsproteins
 commodity with prices observed as 20£, 10£ (resp.) and the quantities consumed
 by the household are 1.5 kg and 2 kg (resp.).
 One approach is to the treat the physical sum of quantities i.e.
 3.5 kg as the quantity of the composite good 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meatsproteins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, it is more difficult to argue that the households optimise the
 weight of the composite good - rather than comparing the disparate quantities
 of goods (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for details of this argument).
 Since quality is to be priced in the market, a quality-adjusted quantity
 is the more appropriate formulation where we consider a price-structured
 weighted quantity as the quality-adjusted quantity and express the pair
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(p_{goat},q_{goat}),(p_{beef},q_{beef})\}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $=\{(20,1.5),(10,2)\}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,5(=2\times1.5+1\times2))$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.43$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $=\frac{5}{1.5+2})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(P_{meats},Q_{meats}),$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(0,V_{meats})\}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $=\{(10,5),(0,1.43)\}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{meats}$
\end_inset

) is simply the minimum of 
\begin_inset Formula $20,10$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the prices of goat and beef respectively - corresponding to the price-structure
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is (2,1) for {goat, beef}.
 In other words, consuming 1.5 kg of goat (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{goat}=1.5$
\end_inset

 ) is equivalent to consuming 3 units of commodity:

Comparing the

\end_inset

 kg of goat and 3 kg of beef so that the prices and quantities are 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(20,0.5),(10,3)\}$
\end_inset

 respectively for goat and beef, we have the same expenditure as before
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}=P_{G}Q_{G}=\sum_{G}p_{i}q_{i}=40$

.
 However, as shown in the table below, the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 and quality 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}$
\end_inset

 now corresponds to

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.14=\frac{4}{3.5})$

 The quality is lower for the latter household even though the sum of physical
 quantities - rather than quality-adjusted 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$

 - is the same.

 We use two formulations with the total household expenditure logarithm

 An indicator variable is also used as control for energy - specifying whether

 Further, since the price for quality is not required, the price-coefficients

 equations are not subject to any restrictions - unlike the budget-share
 estimation equations where the constraints of symmetry are applied.
 More specifically, the symmetry conditions are imposed with

\end_inset

 for all

\begin_layout Standard
The homogeneity and adding-up restrictions mean that the sum of all expenditure
 shares in the AIDS model is unity - thus leading to the residuals variance-cova
riance matrix becoming singular (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 As a solution to this well-known estimation problem, it is common to delete
 one of the equations to estimate and recover its coefficients through the
 adding-up restrictions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ParisCaraccioloTestingAIDSAddingUp2014,LiGangTourismdemand2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the adding-up restrictions require that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{G}^{n}\rho_{1,G}=1$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{G}^{n}\beta_{G,1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{G}^{n}\gamma_{1,Gj}=1$

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j}^{n}\gamma_{1,Gj}=0$
\end_inset

 (for all 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

).
 Thus one of the commodity group (chicken) - which does not correspond to
 a quality is ignored from the estimation.
 The coefficients in the budget-share equation for chicken can be recovered
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{chicken}=1-\sum_{G\ne chicken}^{n}\rho_{1,G}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1,chicken,j}=-\sum_{G\ne chicken}^{n}\gamma_{1,Gj}$

 respectively.

 i.e.
 10 commodities in total.
 The system of equation is thus used to observe the variation of measures
 of quality across the total expenditure and household characteristics in
 Tanzania.
 The entire set of equations consists of two equations for each commodity
 (10) - where one equation (per commodity) has budget-share as the dependent
 variable and another equation has quality-metric as the dependent variable.
 These 
\begin_inset Formula $10\times2=20$
\end_inset

 equations with respective constraints are listed in Appendix IV.
 The AIDS estimation for the system of equations that accommodates the constrain
ts uses a 3SLS method (instead of SUR - which requires at least one regressor
 not used in other equations).

The data used for our analysis has been obtained from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World Bank - for the year 2014
 - which is the last wave in the survey.
 The survey has been designed to assist in the understanding of links between
 asset ownership, community access (to market, schools), food prices and
 agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys from multiple countries is largely uniform in its
 data-model (fields) and is often geo-referenced with a sufficiently wide-covera
ge in the country to allow a study of spatial variation in the observed
 variables.
 The years used for the analyses are the most recent years in the survey
 for Tanzania (2014) i.e.
 the last wave available in the survey at the time of writing this chapter.
 The price-data which we used in the classification described in Section

 The diary method is used for food items while other purchases are recorded
 as weekly, monthly and yearly recalls.
 The expenditures on food are recorded with a greater level of detail than
 other expenditures.
 The demographic variables from survey that we use in our a cross-sectional
 analysis are based on the current locality and the number of members in
 the family.

The consumption microdata for the year (2014) - used for budget shares and
 quality measures - is combined from across the recall and weekly diaries
 - merging the weekly data with yearly data by multiplying the past week's
 consumption into the number of weeks in the year.
 The details of this process are described in Appendix I.
 Once combined, the market prices for the goods consumed by a household
 are matched with the reported consumed quantities of the food items

The absence of a good in the recall record for a household as the good is
 not to be interpreted as evidence of non-usage of the good.
 With the case of electricity, for example, the field for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main lighting fuel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is more reliable for the test of electricity usage than the last expenditure
 on electricity.

The prices relevant for a household are marked as those that are available
 as market prices in the district where the household is located.
 Since the market-observed prices in the survey are recorded at every district
 level or at finer levels, we match these prices with every household in
 the survey based on the district the household is located in.
 This is necessitated also because not all wards and enumerated-areas(EAs)
 within every district in the survey have prices recorded for all relevant
 food items.
 Further, as price observations at the district level are recorded in different
 quantities (grams, kilograms for weight and litres, mls for fluids etc.),
 we infer the price at the district level using a regression over price
 records for the good in the district.
 This is only a means to standardise the prices in a standard unit such
 as a kilogram or a litre from the prices that are recorded in several units.
 Since the price per unit of any item declines with the increase in quantity
 purchase, the price data from across different recorded quantities are
 assimilated using a regression to obtain the price corresponding to a standard
 unit-quantity of an good (kg, litres etc.).
 A simple quadratic expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{m}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 to used to approximate the inverse proportionality of price-per-unit with
 the quantity purchase.
 Thus, observed marked-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 are regressed against the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 they're recorded in where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a constant .
 The price of any arbitrary quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}$
\end_inset

 of a good is thus simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{\underline{q}^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 and for the price of unit-quantity that we use for base-prices and relative
 price structures, the price is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}=1$
\end_inset

 ).

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values of assets owned by the household that we use as a measure for
 wealth are obtained from the record of durable goods in the survey.
 The durable goods in the LSMS data range from short-term durable items
 such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such as land
 or housing.
 Of these, we are interested only in the transferable long-term owned assets
 (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Long-term-assets"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The exclusion of short-term assets or the items that are not transferred
 over a generation is based on consideration of intergenerational wealth
 whose relevance is sought as an SES measure.
 The empirical studies often prefer the data on ownership of assets (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) for SES effects since the inter-generational transfers of wealth are what
 make a break in the inequality gap (i.e.
 mobility through reduction of wealth differences) difficult (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ObasuyiEducationInequality2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Another reason why the income data has not been used directly in the current
 study is that it is available only for around 30% of the households that
 we have the diary data for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assets transferred over a generation that we use for SES measures can
 be readily verified by inspecting households in the data that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household - treating
 the assets except land and house that are more expensive than the bed (furnitur
e) as those that contribute to the long-term asset-values.
 The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include
 the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods - rather than reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 - to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding the household for two
 reasons.
 First, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to the errors associated with the recall of the purchase
 value which varies over years in the panel data for the household and item.
 Second, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 also encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time
 - making it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable consumption
 at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the household and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 varies significantly across Tanzania (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, they do not indicate an extreme segmentation based on assets as
 is reported for many economies in the region (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DDNutrtiionaGhana2011,HailuDDPregnantEthiopia2019"

 It is worth emphasising that FAO standards do not prescribe what's considered
 a low dietary diversity status and it is common for studies to therefore
 consider empirically validated thresholds for the analysis of diversity.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Tanzania do not appear too low (see Figure

The spatial distribution of food insecurity provides us an overview of regional
 disparities in the country.
 To survey food insecurity, we use the directly observed food deprivation
 in the survey to compare the fraction of households having run out of food
 (either due to lack of agricultural inputs or high prices) in the past
 year across urban and rural areas (see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionAgInp"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionHiCost"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the figures do suggest a significant proportion of households running
 out of food in urban areas (due to high costs), the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons- see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionHiCost"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the food insecurity does not seem significantly stronger in either
 urban or rural areas, the extremity of urban-rural or regional differences
 seems evident from a comparison of assets and occupations.
 As a non-parametric view of occupations

 suggest a relevance of permanent income (measured with total expenditure)
 and ownership of assets - along with access to electricity - on the demand
 for quality in food.
 While there is a some heteroskedasticity in the results (tested for with
 Breush-Pagan statistic), the effects of household expenditure and total
 assets owned appear significant for quality.

In Table

\end_inset

, the effect of permanent income (
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 ) is positive on quality across all food commodities i.e.
 the income-elasticities are positive for quality within food categories
 (commodities).
 This does not seem surprising since the income-elasticities for quality
 are expected to be positive so long as a higher total expenditure 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 is spent on the more expensive variants (goods) within a food category
 (commodity).
 The negative income elasticities for budget-share of some food commodities
 are also predictable - if we consider that certain goods are preferred
 for higher (price-based) quality and therefore lower quantity (budget share).
 Of particular attention is how the budget shares show a decline with total
 expenditure logarithm for commodities 
\family typewriter
fat 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 (see coefficients of 
\family typewriter

) .
 More specifically, the increase in food expenditure is associated with
 less quantity (at the cost of higher quality) of 
\family typewriter
fats 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 - while quality consumed for both fats and meats-proteins rises with higher
 total expenditure logarithm (see coefficients of

).
 With cereals, on the other hand, we see that the budget shares rise with
 higher total expenditure logarithm (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qcereals
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{results_has_electric_2014}

) while the cereals-quality also increases with higher total expenditure
 logarithm (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter

\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 The demand for quality (price-based) for meat is unlike that for cereals
 in the sense that higher-income households increase both price-based quality
 and quantity (budget-shares) for cereals whereas they seem increase quality
 without increasing quantity (budget shares) for meats.

Looking at the effect of access to electricity (

\family default
 ) in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we see a higher quality across food categories - an effect similar to
 that of total expenditure logarithm 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp 
\family default
(except for fats where quality is not significantly higher for consumers
 with access to electricity).
 It could be argued that having access to electricity is endogenous with
 higher prosperity.
 Thus it may simply be that those with higher income are the one with access
 to electricity and have a better access to quality through ownership of
 electric appliances.
 However, the correlation of having access to electricity with prosperity
 is more likely through being in the urban area rather through income.
 This is because the indicator variable 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
used for access to electricity is based only on the usage of electricity
 as the primary source of lighting at home.
 The basic usage of electricity hardly reflects the income of the household
 - and is more strongly correlated with being in an area (more often urban)
 where electricity is available (particularly given the sparse distribution
 of electricity in Tanzania).
 Since availability of refrigeration facilities in a market may improve
 the availability of fruits and meats in a wider area, the positive externality
 through being in richer areas - one that includes access to electricity
 - is more likely to be the cause for higher quality in food categories.

The effects of

hsize
\family default
 on quality are also worth noting - as larger families (higher 
\family typewriter
hsize
\family default
 ) corresponds to lower quality (particularly in protein and fruits-veg)
 but lower their budget-share for consumption.
 This suggests a pressure to maintain high quality in larger families with
 children.

A key advantage of using the proposed framework of quality is that it allows
 us to examine the effect of prices of commodities on quality.
 Looking at the effect of (base-)prices (variables 
\family typewriter
lp-
\family default
) in both Tables 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_elecassets_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we see with 
\family typewriter
lpmeatsproteins
\family default
 - for example - that the high base-price of meats-proteins (the cheapest
 meat-protein available in the district) corresponds to higher quality in
 
\family typewriter
fruits
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
veg
\family default
.
 Thus, the households in districts where base-price of 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins 
\family default
(price of cheapest meat-protein) is high also avail higher quality of fruits
 and veg - an indication of how meat consumption may be associated with
 higher income in Tanzania.

The results in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 also suggest certain substitutions in quality across some food commodities.
 For example, with a rise in prices of cereals (
\family typewriter
lpcereals
\family default
), the quality in meats-proteins (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpcereals
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVmeatsproteins
\family default

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}

) increases but the quality in starches (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpcereals
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVstarches
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}

\end_inset

) and vegetables (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpcereals
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVveg 
\family default
in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ) declines - indicating that the consumers tend to increase quality in
 meat-consumption while reducing the quality for starches and veg.
 In other words, with higher prices of (cheapest) meat, the consumer is
 more likely to increase quality elsewhere (e.g.
 in fruits and vegetables) - indicating once again how meat consumption
 rises with higher income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On similar lines, we see that the quality in starches seems to drop with
 rise in prices of fruits (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpfruits
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVstarches
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) whereas the quality in fruits does not rise with the base-price of starches
 (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpstarches
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVfruits
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 In other words, when (cheapest) fruit is more expensive, starch quality
 is also lower for consumers whereas (cheapest) starch being more expensive
 does not raise the quality of fruits for consumers.
 It is more often thus that the consumers spend higher on quality in starches
 when the fruits become expensive (rather than spending higher on quality
 in fruits when starch becomes more expensive).
 A similar relation is not seen between tubers and starches whose consumption
 of quality seem to move together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observation from the budget shares that the expenditure on 
\family typewriter
veg
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 is higher - particularly for 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 - in urban areas can also be verified with a simple calculation of total
 expenditure divided by the commodity base-price.
 Estimating the effective quantity of 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 consumed as the 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 expenditure divided by its base-price, the urban areas seem to consume
 about 1.61 times more 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 and spend 1.63 times more (comparing just expenditure) - not as much for
 the expenditure on 
\family typewriter
chicken
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
fish
\family default
.
 With effective quantity of 
\family typewriter
veg
\family default
, the urban areas consume about 1.1 times more 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 and spend also about 1.1 times more than the rural areas.
 Looking at the expenditures in urban and rural areas for 
\family typewriter
cereals
\family default
, we see that unlike with 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
, the differences in expenditure (or in effective quantity) for 
\family typewriter
cereals
\family default
 across urban and rural areas and are not wide.
 The expenditures also suggest that while the consumption of 
\family typewriter
veg
\family default
 rises with total expenditure logarithm 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 , it does not rise as much as 
\family typewriter

 The quality consumed for meats-proteins does rise with higher total assets

 More specifically, quality for meatsproteins (

 In other words, those with no access to electricity in the urban areas
 are less likely to spend higher on quality of meats-proteins compared to
 the consumers in rural areas.
 The effects of both total expenditure and assets-ownership are significant
 in the quality of consumption for food.
 The access to electricity in urban environment creates clear differences
 in lifestyle choices as well as dependence on higher budgets - an effect
 that remains significant for access to quality in nutrition.
 In summary, even though there may be some positive externality with being
 in the urban areas, the differences in quality of consumption associated

While the question of whether higher quality for food can be considered
 aspirational or not could be answered only after surveys of subjective
 well-being of consumers, there are two observations pertaining to determinants
 of aspirational consumption that we can make from the above results.
 First, the demand for quality is strong for specific food items (rather
 than across wider nutritional categories).
 Second, the role of regional identity is likely to be strong towards aspiration
al consumption due to the extreme life-style differences between urban and
 rural areas.
 The observations seem to be supported by the presence of a strong positive
 externality with rich surroundings in the data on subjective-welfare in
 LSMS survey in Tanzania as well

As a test of the robustness of results, we calculate the food-quality using
 the market-provided prices and instead of the expenditure reported by the
 household.

, we have used diary-costs on goods as reported by the household - costs
 that are recorded by the LSMS for the goods that were consumed from purchases
 in the last week.
 If a household didn't purchase anything in the past week, there would only
 be quantities consumed (not costs) that would be reported for the household
 in the diary.
 Since we have the market-prices available, another way to calculate costs,
 budget-shares and quality would be to infer costs as the multiple of market-pri
ces from the quantities consumed in the past week (which is reported for
 all households regardless of whether they had purchased something in the
 last week or not).
 Recalculating quality and budget shares still shows us the same economic
 and statistical significance (results available on request) of electricity
 and household assets in quality of food categories (commodities).

% The education rank is set to 1 for all pre-primary levels, to rank 2 for
 until the completion of primary education, to rank 3 for up to the secondary
 education level and to 4 for all higher education levels (higher-secondary,
 university etc.).
 For instance, the primary school leaving exam is taken at D7 in Tanzania
 and corresponds to the education rank 2 ; all standards above D7 correspond
 to the education rank 3 and so forth.
 The complete mapping is provided in Table 
\backslash
ref{education_rank_tnz}.
 The argument for using the education-ranks as instruments is simply that
 a higher food quality in food is unlikely to be favoured by differences
 in education levels.
 In other words, while quality - in general - could be constrained due to
 occupational structures in the economy, there are few reasons to think
 that purchases of food could be influenced by one's education level except
 through the permanent income measure.

The availability of market-prices and the details on household characteristics
 as well as owned assets allow us to understand the extent to which quality
 may be segregated by differences in income and urbanisation levels.
 Given the disparate consumer baskets for the urban and rural households
 as well as the disparity in household incomes, the differences in expenditure
 on quality is hardly surprising - but differences in quality for meat and
 fresh goods esp for urban households with access to electricity indicates
 a peculiar environmental difference in areas where urban amenities are
 available.
 Whether we use the income measure based on the total expenditure or the
 measure of intergenerational wealth, the relatively affluent households
 appear to avail significantly higher quality and diversity in food - particular
 in the meats-proteins category.
 Further, the apparent demand for higher quality of meats-proteins - seems
 a consequence of increasing urbanisation and availability of appliances
 (as well as storage facilities in urban areas) - a trend that may not be
 aligned with improvements in nutritional diversity.

 Thus, the consideration of life-style changes arising out of urbanisation
 is essential for treating specific consumption as aspirational.
 In other words, the rise in consumption - when considering quality in food
 items - may be largely a result of increasing urbanisation in the context
 of SSA.

Our results also fit in with the observation on the role of positive externality
 identified by studies on subjective welfare in Tanzania.
 More specifically, while poor relative incomes are meant to be strongly
 related with the general happiness and future outlook of a consumer, the
 evidence from the LSMS data suggests that the positive externalities from
 being in a richer area significantly influence the consumer's happiness
 levels recorded in the survey as well (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "AstebiCarbonell2019"

 ).
 The improvements in food quality indicate a particular channel of how positive
 externalities from being in richer areas might influence the quality of
 life and the subjective welfare of the resident consumers.

 In summary, while it is difficult to treat the rise in food quality with
 income as aspirational, the effects of both urbanisation and income on
 quality suggest that such consumption is on a path to rise with improvements
 in household incomes as well as urban development.
 With food being the most basic of needs and one where higher price-based
 quality seems easy to achieve for markets, the positive effects of income
 on quality seem likely to remain.

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock goods for consumption.
 The LSMS survey records the quantities for food goods - even if they were
 not purchased in the past week.
 But for other non-food goods (such as soap, skin creams whose quantities
 are not recorded in the survey) are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families as well.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption.
 To verify that this not a significant issue, we first test if such stocking
 (quantities purchased) may be uniform in all region in the country.
 We then test the significance of household factors that may affect long-term
 storage (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) of the purchased item.
 Observing the quantity purchased on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure on all goods 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we use a difference-in-means analysis to confirm the low effect of travel-cost
s on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{e}{x})$
\end_inset

 and conclude that stockpiling is not significant.
 It turns out that the number of family members is a far more significant
 factor for large purchases.

For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wide categories of energy and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.

% A lot of goods in the year 2008 were recorded with the unit as pieces/"idadi"
 (e.g.
 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis.
 These goods were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,
 pulses, peanuts, coconut, onion, greens, dried_canned_veg, banana_ripe,
 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk goods where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the goods where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not

 that a substitution between two goods is possible only if they belong to

 than a claim on household's behaviour (see

But a simpler linear-AIDS formulation 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}ln(p_{ih})$

 is also often used (Stone's index).
 Notice that the inverse-mills instrument must also comply with the symmetry
 and homogeneity-restrictions and thus one must ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=0}^{n}\delta_{i}R_{ih}=0$

 in addition to

The first step with the selection approach is a probit where the dependent
 variable is an indicator variable that is unity when the item is consumed
 and zero otherwise.
 The control variables used in the first-stage probit are the prices of
 the item and market-characteristics (region etc.
 - see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_probit"

\end_inset

) .
 The inverse-mills ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the

 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) is then used as an instrument in the AIDS regressions(see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation.

The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).
 The results thus obtained with a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) after
 imposing the constraints are presented in the Table

\begin_layout Standard
The above item-wise analysis suggests a split between the goods that are
 consumed in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant)
 against those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer
 are more readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education show that the goods available
 in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive elasticitie
s for income and education rank whereas the goods of agrarian production
 seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations huddled
 in the urban areas.
 Similarly, how households respond to changes in kerosene and electricity
 prices indicates the limited availability of industrial goods.
 A contrast between the goods that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this urban-rural
 split as well (demand for goods such as rice, beef is less sensitive to
 electricity than it is to kerosene).
 It isn't simply that the households with electricity are more likely to
 consume the more expensive goods (due to their higher incomes) but that
 a certain goods become less relevant in the urban settings or are simply
 unavailable in the rural settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further, the signs of the coefficients suggest that mangoes (less
 consumed) and rice (commonly consumed) to be substitutes while fish appears
 as a complement to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.)
 rice.
 Similarly, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_f
lour]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens - while it is a substitute to bread
 and mangoes respectively.
 The substitution and complementarity thus observed are hardly an indicator
 of the overall quality since the reported cross-price elasticities do not
 consider the functional separation.
 More specifically, one cannot make much out of the cross-elasticities of
 kerosene with respect to buns or cassava unless without imposing strict
 separability assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or model restrictions (such as more buns would means less cooking in the
 household etc.).
 An aggregated view of the basket is thus preferred given our interest in
 the choice of quality exercised by the household when faced with multiple
 varieties of several qualities and price.

It is common for the empirical studies in sub-Saharan Africa to use the
 income data only indirectly.
 There are two mains reasons for this.
 First, the income-data is much more sparse than for occupation or education
 (only about a quarter of households, for example, have income data available
 in the LSMS survey for Tanzania).
 Second, the predominance of informal sectors further subjects the income
 data to significant measurement errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the income data may not be of direct utility to its sparsity, it is
 useful in providing an overview of occupational differences in Tanzania.
 As the household occupation-data is more widely available than the income
 data, we use a mapping of incomes on to the list of occupational (ordered)
 ranks by sorting the occupations based on income.
 More specifically, the occupations are sorted based on the average income
 received and categorised in broad ranks ranging form 0 to 3 (non-paying
 occupations are unemployed status is set to 0 and a higher-rank corresponds
 to a higher-income occupation).
 The occupation ranks thus assigned are shown in Table

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{occupation_rank_tn}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The variation in education levels is also given a similar treatment and
 used as education ranks for comparison.
 In other words, an ordered variable corresponding to the varied education
 levels is inferred as occupation-rank based on income received by the highest-e
ducation level recorded for individuals in the data.
 The mappings from education-levels to education ranks are listed in Table

The economies in sub-Saharan Africa show significant permanent income effects
 that often limit wider access to higher education in the region.
 To examine the extent of such limits on education expenses in a context
 of aspirational consumption, we survey the effects of permanent income
 and regional wealth on education expenses in Tanzania and Nigeria across
 differing levels of availability of secondary education facilities in the
 two economies.
 We find that despite varied contexts of education in the two economies,
 the role of permanent income on education expenses is weakened as urbanisation
 rises in sub-Saharan Africa and that the availability of secondary-education
 facilities can have a stronger effect than that of wealth in the region

%[Pariticpation is low.
 Aspiration is important so it should increase but it is limited by wealth.
  Literature says wealth is more important - but varied urbanisation means
 it's not the same everywhere.
 High quality does  get limited to the elite so it may look like education
 is limited to the elite as well (as the literature says).
 We look at  urbanisation in two economies to understand how urbanisation
 may reduces or increases effects of permanent income for educaton.
 We find that PI effects reduce with urbanisation and that regional effects
 are stronger in TNZ.
 Education is thus likely to become need and urbanisation may have the effect
 of turning education as snob into bandwagon (literature findings about
 labour support it).

 In the presented chapter, we compare the effects of household permanent
 income and regional wealth levels to argue that despite a strong role availabil

 permanent income effects on education expenditures.
 The countries chosen for the comparison are Tanzania and Nigeria - which
 bear similar geographical and demographic metrics while exhibiting significant
 differences in levels of urbanisation and the degree of dependence on agrarian

HOW IS THIS RELEVANT FOR ASPIRATIONAL CONSUMPTION?

The effects household income and wealth on education - i.e.
 the extent to which the household income contributes to education expenses
 - are commonly observed through various mechanisms (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,IliePaulineWhobenefitsfromHE2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Other than through costs (such as transportation) imposed on households
 when public education access is poorer, the household income also influences
 access to education due to information symmetries that may help in future
 job-searches, better representations in the nascent political institutions
 of developing economies or certain social characteristics that align with
 higher household income (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"

\end_inset

).
 As higher intergenerational wealth may help fund higher levels of education,
 the such inequalities of income and wealth can become educational inequalities
 by creating a poverty trap for the lower-income households (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"

\end_inset

) - a concern that has been important for policy in SSA due to the predominance
 of large informal sector in the region and the higher consequent income
 volatility which deprioritises education expenditures for poorer households
 (

Such effects evidently get worse at higher levels of education since the
 foregone labour income through time spent in education becomes costlier
 for households with low possessions or wealth.

 The empirical literature often suggests a stronger role of household wealth
 than physical access for education expenses in the literature (

However, in the current chapter, we focus on effects of rising urbanisation
 on education expenses and argue that despite the limitations presented
 by wealth and permanent income , the overall effect of urbanisation may
 be that of increasing education expenses.
 Therefore, any rent-seeking through higher education were to be considered
 .
 We consider secondary education (higher education is very little in ).

While we measure permanent income effects as the annual total household
 expenditure, the effects of urbanisation - whose effects we wish to detail
 in the current chapter - are interpreted as that of average wealth in the
 immediate area surrounding the household.
 The goal of the particular notion of urbanisation as local regional wealth
 is to take into consideration the spatial variation in the SSA while standardis
ing the measurement of urbanisation across different economies rather than
 the urban-rural distinctions provided in the survey.

 These constitute items that are more often referred to as durable goods

 There seem at least two reasons why the developing economics literature
 more often refers to the durable household possessions as assets.
 First, the financial assets are far less relevant in the developing economies.
 Second, the durable goods such as bicycles or stoves - however insignificant
 - are far more important for consumption behaviour in the developing world.

The urban-rural disparities can influence the participation in education
 through various mechanisms.
 Setting aside the physical access to education - i.e.
 the higher availability of education opportunities in urban areas which
 we consider as a separate control - the two fundamental mechanisms we intend
 to focus on through a measure of urbanisation are the relative abundance
 of opportunities for higher income employment and the social environment
 of the urban areas.
 The better opportunities of employment and wealth overall make education
 more affordable so that the households in rural areas - where incomes are
 invariably lower and education somewhat of a luxury- end up underinvesting
 in education.
 The social environment of urban areas is also often different - leading
 to a stronger need for finding education-dependent employment in urban
 areas.
 Both of the factors constitute the positive externalities from being in
 a rich locality (district) that are encompassed in the measure of urbanisation
 - a measure driven by the concentration of richness in terms of assets.
 More specifically, the study measures urbanisation with the average assets
 values in the household vicinity - while explicitly accounting for other
 social factors pertaining to the household (religious identity etc.) and
 controlling for availabililty of education opportunities.

 The local wealth interpretation of urbanisation provides a continuous (rather
 than categorical) variable for urbanisation levels.
 The local wealth measure also assists us in empirically distinguishing
 the effects of urbanisation from household permanent income effects.
 This is foremost because the asset values used in the wealth concentration

 and social factors, we find that the household permanent income effects

 To compare this assessment with a more conventional approach using urban-rural
 indicators, we also provide estimation results using an alternative formulation
 where a ruralness-score of the district based on urban-rural distinction
 is used instead of the local wealth measure and the permanent income measure
 is replaced with the direct measure of household assets value.

It is worth highlight the importance of physical access as a control - a
 factor that directly influences education expenditure in the above analysis.
 Given the focus on secondary education in development policy as well as
 literature in the last decades (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "FullerVocationalTraining1976,TilakEducationPoverty2002,TilakPostelemEducIndia2007,HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanInvestmentIndianEducUneconomic1980"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), we focus on the accessibility of secondary education in the two economies.
 Controlling for physical access is relevant also because poor education
 access might make wealth effects appear stronger (due to higher transportation
 costs etc.).
 The control in fact often plays a critical role in determining whether
 a given amount of funds is more appropriately used to build accessible
 schools or to support and economise education instead.
 More specifically, if physical access for education is what prevents the
 attainment of education, then building more schools becomes of higher priority.
 On the other hand, if wealth effects are stronger in the economy, then
 affordability of education becomes an important issue - even if returns
 to education were a cause of concern.
 Whether returns to education are enough to increase education participation
 for lower-income households or not - also often hinges on there being less
 significant wealth effects and sufficient physical access to education
 in an economy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"

 The results we obtain with urbanisation levels are particularly significant
 since the wealth effects are more often reported to be stronger than the
 effects of physical access in empirical studies from the region (

 (

LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011"

 present a more challenging task to the empirical studies.
 Early attempts to explain the role of social factors have advanced the
 notion of social capital (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BourdieuCulturalRepr2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - which encompasses habits, preferences and behaviour cultivated in richer
 environments that affect future educational mobility.
 The empirical studies pertaining to social capital - however emphasise
 more often on certain environmental factors - such as the feedback for
 improvement of students, the subjective evaluations of students or other
 measures of social interactions (

 As empirical measures for social capital have neither been considered universal
 nor equivalent to physical in the empirical literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

% The use of occupation as a control also allows us to test if it is more
 often that the non-agrarian workers treat education as a basic need for
 the occupations they aim for (all else being the same) or if it is the

These social factors encompass the acquisition of skills from parents or
 from the social environment (networks) valued in the employment markets
 and higher levels of education.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TanselParentEducEffects1997"

 It is also possible to argue - from a certain human capital perspective
 (

 of wealth (which has a strong effect on educational expenditures) since
 both accumulations are transferred to further generations (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BeckerTomesEquilibMobility1979"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - therefore making it a relevant control to consider.
 The other relevant social factor that may favour participation in education
 is the main occupation in the household.
 More particularly, the agrarian or non-agrarian nature of the household
 occupation in a largely agrarian economy may indicate a non-transactional
 advantage for individuals through the social networks they acquire.
 Other household characteristics of social significance that influence participa
tion in education vary across the economies.
 In Tanzania, for example, the speakers of English language seem to be generally
 more educated and have higher incomes.
 The ability to speak English could indicate an exposure to education in
 ways that the poorer or rural households may not be exposed.
 The religious identities also have some implications for participation
 in education in countries such as Nigeria (

An essential claim of the human capital theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) - which the empirical literature on determinants of education expenditure
 often relies on - is that the educational investments must change over
 the life cycle of consumers.
 The current chapter takes advantage of the reporting of household expenditures
 on education at individual level in the surveys for both the countries
 and considers how the education expenditure may vary with the age of the
 children in the household.
 The variables for childrens' ages are important for our comparison also
 because the education expenditures for a population where the majority
 joins the workforce after attaining primary education would be very different
 from one where the employment opportunities are higher for educated individuals.
 Since large households have higher basic needs than smaller households,
 we also consider the number of children as another relevant control that
 is closely related with lifecycle concerns.
 It is worth highlighting that while one may expect the household expenses
 on education to decline with the rise in number children due to a higher
 cost pressures, studies often find that education enrollments to rise instead
 of decline with the number of children in some sub-Saharan African countries

It is worth emphasising how a particular sense of urbanisation also helps
 us separate the effects of wealth concentration from the social factors
 identified above.
 The measure of wealth-concentration as inter-generational long-term assets
 quantifies urban-rural disparities and allows us to assess the extent to
 which a higher wealth concentration may provide a more supportive environment
 for education participation after accounting for the effects of wealth,
 occupation in the household, the physical access in the region (the district
 boundary in the surrounding 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$

 distance) and other factors of social significance.
 The particular interpretation of urbanisation is based on suggestions to
 consider spatial distribution of assets in the recent literature - which
 has emphasised the network of occupations and contractual relationships
 surrounding the ownership of land or natural resources in SSA (

As mentioned earlier, the two economies in SSA that we have selected for
 our comparison of education expenditure have different levels of economic
 development and a different degree of dependence on agrarian output.
 More particularly, Nigeria relies more heavily on energy exports while
 Tanzania's economy is more reliant on its agricultural output - a difference
 that is critical for the varied level of urbanisation in the two economies.
 While the educational attainments in the populations of the two countries
 are evidently shaped by the idiosyncrasies of the policy and distinct social
 factors, the varying levels of urbanisation in the two economies allow
 us to explore the challenges that improvement of employment opportunities
 and economic development may bring towards access to education in the region.
 [HOW IS SOLVING WEALTH EFFECT PROBLEM RELEVANT TO ASPCON] More particularly,
 if wealth effects matter less in the urbanised areas i.e.
 if education is more egalitarian for residents in the urban areas (after
 controlling for physical access), then the policy may not need to focus
 on wealth effects and direct the attention to improving access elsewhere
 instead.
 On other hand, if wealth effects are significant despite higher economic
 development in urbanised regions, then more attention is needed for improvement
 of access to education for lower-income households.

To summarise, household wealth and urbanisation levels are the main explanatory

 characteristics serve as important controls
\begin_inset Foot

Since urban households evidently have higher wealth, a comparison of urbanisatio
n and wealth effects is not without concerns of a correlation between household
 wealth and urbanisation.
 However, as the study is concerned only with the relative importance of
 urbanisation and permanent income measures in the two countries - rather
 than the elasticities of expenditure, these issues are less relevant to
 the comparison of household educational expenditure.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first explanatory variable i.e.
 the wealth or the permanent income of the household uses the logarithm
 of household's total annual expenditure.
 The use of total expenditure as permanent income is common in studies on
 consumption and relies on standard consumption theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

 The urbanisation levels correspond to a wealth-concentration measure that
 is used as the second explanatory variable (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for details).
 As mentioned earlier, the wealth-concentration measure is simply the average
 asset-ownership levels in the households' vicinity.
 The physical access to education - is measured with the number of secondary
 schools in every district so that a higher score of 
\family typewriter

\family default
 for a district implies more secondary schools in the district.
 Further robustness checks are conducted by redefining the wealth concentration
 measures which vary the boundaries of households vicinity and examine the
 significance of wealth-concentration in the household's neighborhood of
 similar occupations (agrarian/non-agrarian) and education ranks (primary,second
ary).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the alternative formulation - which we provide for a comparison with
 a more conventional approach using urban-rural demarcations from the survey
 - the total value of long-term assets owned by the household i.e.
 the measure of household wealth is used as the first explanatory variable
 and a

 also common in the studies from health and household economics (

The main finding from the current study is that a higher urbanisation is
 correlated with lower severity of wealth effects in the region considering
 the two economies.
 While the higher urbanisation may itself depend on the country's governmental
 efficiency, natural resources or fiscal condition, it does seem to reduce
 the wealth effects on education.
 Despite the peculiarities of inequality in SSA such as high land-labour
 ratios and sparse distribution of economic resources (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersoninequalityandvariableSAA2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), therefore, the weakening of wealth effects with rising urbanisation points
 in a promising direction - through rise in employment opportunities - and
 marks past success in education improvements in the region.
 The study also finds that the segregation of education opportunities and
 the disparities in future employment opportunities across the country are
 more evident in Tanzania where the differences between urban and rural
 prosperity seem more extreme.
 The other side of the seemingly desirable effects of urbanisation, therefore,
 is that the need to improve to education participation in less urbanised
 areas remains a significant challenge for policy.
 The recommendations for addressing non-formal education and improving basic
 education for rural populations may therefore be an important concern for
 an education policy when urbanisation is not readily achievable for the
 economy.

[REWRITE TO CONNECT WITH THE PREDICTION OF RISE IN EDUCATION with URBANISATION]
 The current chapter contributes to the literature on determinants of education
 in two different ways.
 First, it demonstrates that despite the challenges of urban overpopulation,
 the effect of urbanisation may be a desirable one for the education levels
 of the population and the lifestyle improvements in urban areas.
 This may support the conventional view that despite the evident problems
 with rise in inequality, the urbanisation may play a key role in economic
 growth through rise in employment opportunities and income from higher
 paid occupations (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KuznetsEconomicGrowthIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 More particularly, the weakening in severity of wealth effects with the
 rise in urbanisation could indicate the pathways to future improvements
 in income equality and reduction in education inequalities through developments
 of the industrial sector and rise in demand for education.
 The second contribution of the chapter is the delineation of links between
 levels of economic activity and education levels - which we perform considering
 the spatial concentration of wealth and education across the two economies.
 While most of the literature we have surveyed has focused on the urban-rural
 dichotomy from community, the current study relies on the spatial distribution
 of wealth to examine the specific link between wealth-concentration, occupation
al levels and education expenses in the region.

 a mere willingness - to pay for education among the poor (

An important consideration for education attainment in the population is
 that while higher education provides needed skills for higher incomes,

While the wealth-effects remain significant in SSA, much of the discussion

 On one hand, the literature attributes these problems to the prevalent
 mismanagement in public education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Instead of focusing on the returns-to-education, we argue that the poor

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive externalities from education - which one may use to argue that
 the returns-to-education perspective is an incomplete one - are less of
 an issue in the context of SSA.
 Many empirical studies in fact report several instances of waste in rent-seekin
g activities after graduation in the SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oketchAfricaHE2016,MinnisNonformalEducation2006,dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The case for positive externalities from education is weakened further
 due to the low economic growth experienced by the countries in the last
 decades - a slide that may have suppressed the value of secondary or higher
 education in the region.
 While there should be little doubt on that the concerns for return-to-education
 are important, they do need to be viewed in the context of wealth effects
 and availability of education facilities.
 More specifically, it is possible that the demand for education is suppressed
 due to inadequate income (relatively high prices of education) in the economy
 or a sparse distribution of education opportunities rather than due to
 lower pay from post-education employment opportunities alone (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, if education expenditures are better explained with physical
 access, then the policy may need to focus on building more accessible schools
 whereas if wealth-effects are more significant, then there is a need to
 make education more affordable for the lower-income households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of SSA, the empirical studies have generally found that the
 physical access is less significant than the wealth effects (

Another way to interpret the effect of a standardised wealth-concentration-based
 measure of urban-rural differences is to contrast local vs wider wealth
 disparities that prevent access to education.
 In other words, the wealth-concentration interpretation of urbanisation
 helps us explore whether the effects of a wealthier locality have a stronger
 influence on education than household income (indicate by total expenditure)
 or not.

 the survey could encapsulate social divisions - such as ethnic or socioeconomic

 While this early research had viewed education as a certain high-culture

 refinements have focused on the specific role of social networks and parental
 acquisitions or skills (

 More importantly, as

 In another study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 point out that higher educated parents invariably spend more time with
 children - a social factor that contributes to how parental education levels
 influence the next generation.
 In fact, the high-culture participation does not always influence educational
 performance positively either.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in South Korea as it takes time off from study.

 through economic factors that are relevant for participation in education.
 Recent literature is thus more often concerned with a

In summary, we note several factors - such as the pro-rich nature of education,
 an insufficient focus on informal economy, mismanagement in public expenditure
 on education and poor returns after graduation - that may simultaneously
 contribute to education expenses and the low education participation in
 SSA.
 The disparate local environments in the SSA imply that generic or partial
 solutions to improvements of education opportunities are unlikely to be
 successful if one ignores local income disparities.
 For instance, the dual-model (

It is worth admitting that despite the notable progress made towards education
 attainment in SSA, there are evident limits to what education alone can
 achieve.
 In fact, the structural problems which the region faces have rather definite
 implications for the education expenses in SSA.
 Therefore, while local wealth disparities are important, a broad outlook
 towards education expenses in the region must also take into account the
 wider macro-economic context of the economies in the region.
 A few distinguishing aspects of the economies in the SSA are worth stating
 in this regard.
 The high-land labour ratios - a recurrent theme in the studies on SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 the varied inequality and migration-pressures in the region (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoseGhebruLandEthiopia2018"

 The high susceptibility of the region to volatilities in commodity prices
 is another issue that affects household budgets significantly (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The presence of a large informal sector facing such uncertainties further
 constrains the funding for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 such as education.
 Finally, the political powers availed by the lower-income workforce - which

 In particular, we note that Nigeria has had more investments in commodities
 sector (oil and petroleum) than Tanzania - which remains a relatively agrarian
 economy.
 Additionally, the policy of education has also been different in the two
 economies - with Tanzania having a history of restrictions of secondary
 education at a time when other countries in the region were expanding their
 education sector (

 As mentioned earlier, we rely primarily on a local wealth measure for urbanisat
ion levels - while providing results from a formulation based on urban-rural
 indicators for comparison.
 In the main formulation, the logarithm of total expenditure is used as
 the main explanatory variable while the wealth concentration measure -
 the second explanatory variable - is calculated as the average assets in
 the consumer's district (for smaller districts, the average over multiple
 districts within a 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 boundary is taken).
 In the alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators, the two explanator
y variables are the wealth based on durable goods from the survey and an
 ruralness score based on urban-rural indicators themselves.
 The measures for wealth-concentration (as well as the first explanatory
 variable in the alternative formulation) rely on the market-value of durable
 goods (including land, housing) that are reported in the survey (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 It is worth highlighting that the durable goods are considered as part
 of the consumer wealth only if they are transferable over generations.
 The ownership of goods that won't last more than a lifetime enter as consumptio
n for the household rather than as assets contributing to the intergenerational
 wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a simple econometric model, the representative household balances i)
 her non-durable consumption (excluding education) with ii) increasing expenditu
re on education for the children.
 The non-durable consumption that the household may spend on excludes the
 expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and non-durable consumption excluding assets-related-c
osts thus form the consumer budget in the model.
 In this model for cross-sectional comparison of education expenses, we
 do not consider the substitution with savings towards durable goods.
 Other than our focus on cross-sectional effects, another reason why we
 avoid panel methods in the current study is a severe measurement error
 with time-varying household asset values in the survey (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details of asset values recorded in the consumption microdata).
 More specifically, the variation in time of ownership of assets is not
 accurate enough for us to measure the changing value of household assets
 possessions - due to the inconsistent recalls of the number of assets over
 time for the same household.

It is worth highlighting that the econometric analysis is limited for households
 having one or more children.
 In other words, only households with at least one member with their age
 less than 18 are considered in the analysis.
 Since the households with lower working age are likely to have less accumulatio
ns as well as needs, the average paternal age in the household is also used
 as a control in the comparison.
 The number of children (household-size), the educational level of the parents,
 the accessibility of schools in the district and the social characteristics
 of the household such as religion and language spoken are other important
 controls used in the analyses.
 Notice that for the paternal educational levels, we use an educational
 rank that is standardised by differentiating between primary, secondary
 and higher educational levels (see Section

As described earlier, one of the interpretation of urbanisation is the wealth
 concentration - which is measured as the log-averages of the values of
 durable goods (calculated as per the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited, we focus on durable goods that can be transferred over a generation.
 For both Tanzania and Nigeria, we therefore include items as long-term
 assets only if they are costlier than furniture - which is the cheapest
 asset to be transferred between the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 These costs are used both for the wealth-concentration measures and the
 assets-measure.
 As explained earlier, the permanent-income measure uses the logarithm of
 total expenditure at the household level.

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data for Tanzania.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geo-coding of districts for the
 wider level consumer vicinity based on Euclidean distance.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards
 in the 6

 A district with a higher score has more wards that have a secondary school

 This measure takes care of the issue that there are many wards (and enumerated-
areas within) having consumer entries for assets and consumption that the
 school-availability (primary as well as secondary ) is not recorded for.
 The aggregation over districts takes care of this issues there are no district
 with consumer entries for assets and consumption that we don't have the
 total number (score) of secondary-schools for.
 This score evidently also factors in the high-population density in urban
 areas since densely populated districts would have more wards within the

The next important control is the occupation of the households which is
 directly available for every individual in the survey.
 Whether an occupational sector is agriculture-related or not determined
 is based on the main occupation of household head (HH).
 The number of children in the household, the ages of the children (and
 other members) are directly observed in the data.
 Since the typical household unit in Tanzania and Nigeria may not be a nuclear
 family, the paternal educational level - which is another important control
 in the study - cannot simply be the education level of the household head(HH).
 This is because unlike for nuclear families, the individuals on whom the
 household's reported  education expenses are spent, could be the grandchildren
 (rather than children) of the joint-family household-head.
 To avoid letting the household's paternal education level point to the
 generation before the parents of children for certain joint-family households
 - where the HH has his/her grandchildren attending school - while letting
 the same variable point to the parents of children in school for nuclear-famili
es (where HH has his/her children attending school), we rely on a more uniform
 measure for a household's highest education rank

Notice that only relations with the household head are reported in the survey.
 Thus, there is no direct way of locating the parent of a child except through
 the relation with the household-head.

To provide a uniform treatment to educational levels across both Tanzania
 and Nigeria, we use 4 education categories - setting the education rank
 to 1 for all pre-primary levels, to rank 2 for until the completion of
 primary education, to rank 3 for up to the secondary education level and
 to 4 for all higher education levels (higher-secondary, university etc.).
 These mappings are provided in Tables

 and

\end_inset

 (see Appendix).
 For instance, the primary school leaving exam is taken at D7 in Tanzania
 and corresponds to the education rank 2 ; all standards above D7 and before
 O course (Diploma) correspond to the education rank 3 and all education
 levels at or above O course correspond to education rank 4 for Tanzania.
 Similarly, the levels above P6 - which is the highest primary education
 level in Nigeria - implies an education rank 3 (corresponding to P6 in
 Tanzania) and all education levels at or above the technical training level
 (treated equivalent to Diploma level in Tanzania) are correspond to education
 rank 4.
 As access to private education may be significant in the urban-areas, we
 also use a control for private-education that is available in the survey.

The languages spoken (

 in Nigeria) - used as controls - are recorded at the individual's level
 in the survey data for the countries and are directly used as controls
 in the survey.
 To control for the price of consumption in the household's district, we
 also use the non-durable consumption averages 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 (excluding the costs associated with ownership of assets in the survey).
 The measurement 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne

 of price is akin to the price-deflator (unit-value) methods used in the
 demand literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 The rationale for excluding costs associated with assets is that the costs
 of maintaining assets (fees, repair costs, usage costs etc.) are not levied
 on those who don't own the related assets and should not be included in
 the general price of non-durable consumption.

\begin_layout Standard
Despite similarities in geographic areas, age-distribution of populations,
 public infrastructure and use of English as the primary administrative
 language, the economies of the two countries on Eastern and Western coasts
 of Africa exhibit quite a few structural differences - owing primarily
 to levels of industrialisation and endowments in natural resources.
 Tanzania is spread over nearly 885,800 sq km of land while Nigeria sprawls
 over 910,768 sq km of total land.
 The age-distribution of the populations and the dependency ratio are similar
 in the two economies while the population growth rate remains under 3%.
 As of 2020, Nigeria had a population of 206.1 million and Tanzania's population
 was 59.7 million (source: World Bank).
 The differences in public infrastructure do not appear to be extremely
 wide - since Tanzania has a total of 145,203 km length of roadways while
 Nigeria has 195,000 km (based on a 2022 estimate).
 With nearly 43% of land in Tanzania being agricultural and over 37% of
 the land being forest land (based on a 2018 estimate), urban residents
 are more numerous in Nigeria - where agricultural land is nearly 78% of
 the total land and leaves only 9.5% of forest land.
 Only 36.7% of the population is urban in Tanzania whereas urban residents
 constitute 53.5% of the population in Nigeria (2022 estimates).
 The differences in urbanisation levels across the two economies seem stable
 - since the rate of urbanisation is nearly the same in the two economies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher urbanisation in Nigeria is not without severe disparities in
 living standards.
 The infant-mortality in Nigeria (56.68 /1000) - for example - is in fact
 nearly double that of Tanzania (30.87/1000) and the per-capita availability
 of physicians remains lower in Nigeria (0.38/1000) relative to Tanzania
 (0.7/1000).
 The overall literacy is slightly better in Tanzania as well - with 77.9%
 population considered literate (above 15 years of age having the ability
 to read or write in any language) compared to 62% in Nigeria.
 Even though the countries have similar school life expectancy (9 years),
 the youth unemployment (between ages 15-24) is at a staggering 18.3% in
 Nigeria compared to 3.9% in Tanzania.
 The overall poverty also seems more widespread in Nigeria - with 40.1% below
 the poverty line (estimate) compared to 26.4% of the population living below
 the poverty line in Tanzania (2017 estimate).
 This is despite higher income inequality in Tanzania which has a Gini-coefficie
nt for household income of 40.5 (2017 estimate) compared to 35.1 for Nigeria
 (2018 estimate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A brief overview of the two economies using data from OECD (Organisation
 for Economic Cooperation and Development) suggests that of the two economies,
 a higher percent of the GDP comes from agricultural production in Tanzania.
 The per-capita GDP 2020 for Nigeria (2396.04 USD) is much higher than that
 of Tanzania (976.16 USD) (source World Bank).
 The GDP from manufacturing, mining and construction is nearly double for
 Nigeria (8749.61 million USD in 2022) compared to Tanzania (4221.41 million
 USD in 2021).
 Nigeria's GDP from agriculture is 9311.36 million USD and Tanzania's is
 4313.47 million USD.

The structural differences seem to be due to a higher reliance on energy
 exports for Nigeria - which, as of 2020, exports $35.9 billion crude-gas
 and imports $7.75 billion of refined Petroleum apart from cars ($3.03 billion)
 and wheat ($2 billion).
 On the other hand, Tanzania's major exports are Gold and other minerals
 ($3 billion) followed by agricultural products (0.594$ billion).
 The major imports of Tanzania are refined copper and petroleum ($2.2B).
 Among the two economies, Nigeria relies less on the agrarian exports and
 more on the energy-related infrastructure - likely accounting for higher
 average education levels in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the political systems in the two countries, Tanzania has shown a higher
 propensity to state control as nearly all land resources in Tanzania are
 government-owned.
 Tanzania is also more uniform ethnically - as about 95% of Tanzanian nationals
 identify as Bantu.
 On the other hand, the ethnic composition is more varied in Nigeria with
 Hausa (30%), Yoruba (15.5%) and Igbo (15.2%) as prominent ethnic groups.
 The policy of education has also seen different directions in the two economies.
 At a time when other countries in the region were expanding their education
 sector, the secondary education opportunities had faced some restrictions
 in Tanzania (

key "soderbomReturnstoEducationTNZKYA2006,appletonKenyaeducationalExpansion1999,buchertEducTNZ1992"

 ).
 The private education seems to have flourished with relatively fewer limits
 in Nigeria.
 The effects of all of these factors towards education expense should become
 clearer in further subsections.

Considering the overall distribution of education expenses, we see that
 the urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in both the economies.
 The urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents in Nigeria
 whereas they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for tertiary education (rank 3) is almost
 double that of the expenditure on secondary education (rank 2) in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these expenditures rise by about 54%.
 The educational expenses do not seem to rise much with asset disparities
 in Nigeria - whereas they seem to be more unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure

Despite the uniformity in LSMS data fields corresponding to education expenses,
 the collection methodology may not be the same across all the countries.
 This is evident from the much lower educational expenses in Nigeria than
 in Tanzania (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Our comparison of the two economies (Tanzania and Nigeria) therefore does
 not rely on the measurement of educational expenses relative to one another.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Comparing education levels of the household heads, we see that the average-educ
ation rank of the household heads in Tanzania (1.8) is lower than that in
 Nigeria(1.9).
 We also see that the role of private education is much higher in Nigeria
 (see Figure

, we note that the measures for average budget shares (
\family typewriter

\family default
) as well as educational expenses (
\family typewriter

\family default
) are not dissimilar in both the economies.
 The average number of children in households that are of an age appropriate
 for primary, secondary or tertiary education are not far from each other
 either (see values for 
\family typewriter

\family typewriter

).
 A clear difference between Tanzania and Nigeria - however - is that of
 standard-deviation in asset density (
\family typewriter
assetdensity
\family default
) - which is higher for Tanzania.
 Further, the predominance of agricultural occupations (see stdev values
 for 
\family typewriter
agri
\family default
) is higher for Tanzania as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth pointing that barring such broad observations, the LSMS data
 used in our analyses may not permit a cross country comparison for education
 expenses in a much finer detail.
 One reason is simply that the distribution of savings, income and employment
 opportunities is disparate in the two economies.
 The other reason is that there is also a difference in sizes or granularity
 of district classifications in the two economies.
 More specifically, the sizes of districts in Tanzania seem much larger
 (particularly in the rural parts) than in Nigeria.
 This is why the per-district density of secondary education facilities
 - which we measure with the variable 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 - is reported lower in Nigeria (see values corresponding to 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) - while the education levels of the consumer populations remains higher
 in Nigeria (see highest_educ in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 The ruralness of districts - measured as number of wards declared as rural
 in a district (i.e.
 the variable 
\family typewriter
rural_wards
\family default
) - does not seem affected by this disparity in sizes as much (compare the
 values for 
\family typewriter
rural_wards
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) - since a rural-urban classification that declares boundaries of a district
 based on areas surrounding an urban (or semi-urban) centre tends to bring
 a uniformity to the number of rural wards in a district.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the overall distribution of assets (durable
 goods stocks) in the two countries is disparate - as is clear with a direct
 comparison of asset values.
 Contrasting the Lorenz curves for total non-durable expenditure and total
 assets in the Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for in Nigeria and Tanzania, we note that distribution of assets is more
 sparse in Tanzania even though the overall expenditure appears similarly
 distributed in the two countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A geographical distribution of assets further details that higher-income
 occupations are far fewer in the hinterland and the southern regions of
 Tanzania (see Figure

 (Nigeria) are based on the standardisation of various occupations in Tanzania
 and Nigeria.
 Since the range of occupations in the surveys from Tanzania and Nigeria
 is varied, the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria
 have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey so that
 a higher occupation rank represents an occupation that provides higher
 income.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and the reporting
 of occupations in surveys from both the economies

It is not uncommon for the empirical studies in SSA to have the data on
 occupation or education proxy the income differences (Alesina et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem
 that may be further aggravated because of a large informal sectors in the
 economies.

 A higher occupation rank represents occupations that bring higher income.
 As described in Section

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the key observation from the data is that the disparities in income and
 durable goods are more localised in Nigeria while they are more extreme
 across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure

To reiterate, a significant number of household units in both the economies
 are made up of joint families where the reported educational expenses correspon

 The education level of the HH would thus point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and the previous generation for
 younger households where HH has young children.
 To resolve this disparity, we avoid using the education rank of the HH
 and instead use the highest education rank in the generation of the students'
 parents

 The tobit uses a lower limit of zero given a number of houses have no expenditu

 A zero expenditure is reported for nearly 65% households in the survey
 from Nigeria (2015) and 43% households in the survey from Tanzania (2014).
 This suggests that either the education expenses are recorded in more detail
 in Tanzania or that a certain basic level of expenses is not considered
 in the survey for Nigeria.
 The particular disparity also limits our ability to compare educational
 expenses relative to one another for the two economies.

 This seems largely due to the educational expenses forming a higher proportion
 of the total expenditure for poorer households - since the education expenditur

 Thus while urbanisation must raise the prices of non-durable expenditure
 
\family typewriter

 of living (non-durable consumption) alone.
 In other words, the expenditure on education is necessitated despite the

 This is an indication of the regional disparities in the economies.
 More particularly, the differences in density of assets indicate the level
 of urbanisation that have a strong effect on education expenses - despite
 controlling for the effect of availability of secondary-school education.
 While absence of educational facilities must clearly suppress education
 expenses in a region, the positive effect of assets-density after controlling
 for availability of education facilities also suggests relevance of certain
 environmental factors that contribute to education - such as a competition
 towards higher income social positions or presence of occupations requiring
 higher levels of education - factors with an important role after the availabil
ity of educational facilities has been considered.

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of household total expenditure are - however - relevant for
 private education - which is limited to the wealthier households in both

 While a higher proportion of young population seems to be in private schools
 in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It also seems that the consumers are more likely to spend on primary education
 in Tanzania - as the access to secondary and tertiary-education remains
 much lower (this is further elaborated in discussion below of the results

 However, the inference of a higher expenditure on education - when using
 urban-rural indicators - by the rural residents in Nigeria (see significance

 This is confirmed with the weaker role of wealth i.e.

 We also see that the educational expenditure

 rises with the second explanatory variable i.e.
 the wealth concentration (

 In the alternative formulation where urbanisation is measured with the

Continuing with the comparison of results with education-expenditure

 The education expenses in Nigeria therefore depend less often on whether

 The results also indicate lower access to secondary and tertiary-education

 The decomposed view of expenses on education in terms of secondary and

 the far lower access to secondary education in Tanzania.

The role of the number of children (

 due the education expenses primarily driven by the primary education levels
 in Tanzania (as well as a higher percentage of households reporting no
 education expenditure in the survey from Nigeria).
 Another consequence of most households spending on primary education alone
 is that the agrarian households appear as spending higher on education
 after considering the wealth-concentration among households with the same
 educational-status.
 The education expenditure is higher for agrarian households in Tanzania
 after taking into account their poor educational status (see coefficients

The wealth effects in Tanzania overall seem stronger, but they ought to

 but a higher dependence on industrial output in Nigeria also seems to have
 contributed to a higher demand for secondary and tertiary education in
 the economy overall ( compare with significance of

 Another observation - the stronger role of father's education level in
 Tanzania - also seems related with these disparities in the two economies
 as well.
 A comparison of education expenditures across the two countries must take
 into account the different stages which the two countries appear to be
 in terms of urbanisation and economic development.

Finally, the role of social environment is found significant in both the

To confirm that the assets-ownership does influence the access to education,
 we inspect the role of assets in lower and higher sub-samples of the surveyed
 population.
 We thus re-estimate the results with wealth concentration

 as the explanatory variable for those with less than the local median wealth
 i.e.
 assets-worth logarithm

 The results demonstrate how the education expenditures (coefficients for

While the role that the wealth-concentration 
\family typewriter
assetdensity
\family default
 plays towards access to education appears similar for the rich and poor
 halves in a locality as well, we do see a higher economic significance
 of wealth-concentration 
\family typewriter
assetdensity
\family default
 for the below-median-assets household in Nigeria - possibly because of
 high education costs in urban areas where asset-possession may be lower.
 The access to private education and to higher education favour the richer
 households in both economies - as the economic significance of private-educatio
n factor variable 
\family typewriter
educpriv 
\family default
is consistently higher for richer households as is the expenditure on tertiary
 level education in both the economies (considering the budget shares).
 The significance of social factors - on the other hand - remains unaffected
 by whether the consumers have above or below the median asset ownership
 level.
 More specifically, the factor variables for English-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english
\family default
 and (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
religion 
\family default
) are significant in results from Tanzania and Nigeria (respectively) for
 both richer and poorer households.
 The factor variable for English-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english
\family default
 is significant for consumers both above and below media asset possession
 level (the coefficient for variable 
\family typewriter

To ensure that the effect of assets remains strong after accounting for
 occupation or education level, we recompute the wealth concentration by
 considering only those in the household's vicinity with the same value
 of the indicator for primary/higher-than-primary education-level of the
 household-head and then again with the same value for the agrarian/non-agrarian
 occupation indicator.
 Three types of vicinities thus implied - are summarised in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{tab:ReferenceDefinitions}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first interpretation is one that we have already described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Discussion"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 - where a simple average of the total assets owned by the households in
 the consumer's district is used.
 Both education rank and an agrarian-occupation factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the household head's occupation is agrarian or not are
 used as controls in this interpretation of the vicinity.
 The second interpretation of the vicinity presented as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{educ}$
\end_inset

 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{tabTNZNGR_reduc}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is based on a supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the education level of the household-head is higher
 than primary school or not.
 More specifically, this second interpretation uses the prosperity within
 the educational levels implied by supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is also used as the additional control in this second interpretation.
 Finally, the third interpretation of vicinity is based on the average prosperit
y in the agrarian vs non-agrarian occupations (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

) and uses educational rank as the additional control variable.
 The results from this third interpretation of vicinity are presented in

 (respectively) for Tanzania and Nigeria, we see again that while the wealth
 concentration corresponds to a rise in educational expenditure logarithm
 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 for Nigeria, its effect is insignificant (whether one uses the wealth-concentra
tion in the supra-primary-educated neighbourhood 
\family typewriter

or wealth-concentration in the agrarian-neighbourhood 
\family typewriter
assetdensity_agri

 Further, since the coefficients for secondary-age indicator

\family default
 seem higher for the agrarian/non-agrarian vicinity (i.e.
 the coefficient for wealth-concentration in 
\family typewriter
assetdensity_agri

) than for the supra-primary education vicinity ( i.e.

\family typewriter
 
\family default
wealth-concentration in

 agrarian or non-agrarian occupations than by education levels the populations
 have attained.

\bar under
We had set ourselves to examine the extent to which educational expenses
 are limited by wealth effects
\bar default
 by testing if local wealth effects are more important than urbanisation
 levels for education expenses in two economies of the SSA that are dissimilar
 in terms of industrial output.
 While there are idiosyncratic differences between the two countries we've
 used for our comparison, the weakening of wealth effects with higher urbanisati
on is a notable implication relevant to both the concern for aspiration
 consumption and the education policy in the region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the agrarian consumers maintain a high budget share on education expenses
 in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and since higher education ranks correspond
 to higher education expenses in the more developed economy (Nigeria), one
 can argue that the educational expenses are likely to remain high as more
 of the population attains education as the regional prosperity rises.
 This also seems aligned with the recent finding from a cohort-study by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that the labour with skills added through education is less willing to
 stay in agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main findings that can be highlighted from our results.
 First, the effects of urbanisation levels - whether interpreted as wealth
 concentration or as urban-rural indicators from the survey - are significant
 on education expenses in both the economies.
 Second, the lower wealth continues to prevent access to education and mobility
 in both the economies - even though rises in education expenses seem inevitable
 when the employment opportunities increase in an economy.
 In light of both the findings, the wealth effects seem less extreme in
 the higher developed economy (i.e.
 Nigeria) than in the less developed economy (i.e.
 Tanzania).
 In other words, wealth effects - after accounting for urbanisation - appear
 to become weaker with rise in urbanisation.
 A rise in urbanisation associated with weaker wealth effects supports a
 view of conventional pathways to equity in both income and equality (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KuznetsEconomicGrowthIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Considered as aspirational consumption, the educational expenses are thus
 expected to rise in the region with more urbanisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, the importance of urbanisation does not discount the need to
 improve access to education for the lower and middle-income populations
 in the region.
 Even though the literature often notes a higher significance of wealth
 effects, the consideration of urbanisation suggests that role of physical
 access may continue to be important in economies with wide disparities
 in urbanisation levels.
 This is of crucial importance also because the private educational institutions
 - which are more common in Nigeria - do not yet play a major role in the
 provision of education in the region.
 Instead, a more significant role continues to be played by the state-institutio
ns in both the economies.
 The role of social differences indicated by the significance of social
 characteristics in education expenses for both the economies - further
 emphasises the need to improve access to education.
 These findings are aligned with the wider observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who elaborate on the significant role of religious and colonial institutions
 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.

In summary, the development of the education sectors seems to be at different
 stages of development in the Tanzania and Nigeria.
 The privatisation of education in Nigeria seems to have coincided with
 attendance of higher level education in a way that is yet to be seen for
 Tanzania - where education has not expanded as much yet.
 The wealth effects do seem strong in both the economies, but the relevance
 of wealth-concentration in the population having higher education levels
 points to a promising albeit precarious direction where more urbanisation
 could improve access to education and employment opportunities in the region
 while increasing expenses on education overall.

\begin_layout Abstract
Status motivations for consumption have generated an immense interest at
 a time when social mobility has been relatively stagnant - but the consequences
 of inequality within societies on patterns of development are still poorly
 understood.
 In the proposed chapter, we consider an economy with a hierarchy of positions
 that consumers are able to move between.
 We then ask how the relative incomes associated with each position within
 this setting influence the agents’ saving, consumption and labour supply
 decisions.
 With greater effort improving one’s chances of moving to a higher position,
 two competing forces arise.
 On one hand, the inequality in incomes associated with different positions
 motivates striving for a high position holding the chance of winning that
 position fixed.
 But on the other hand, ensuring that the probabilities of moving up and
 moving down are equal across the society reveals that these positional
 contests can become uncompetitive.
 Greater inequality lowers the chances that striving effort pays off.
 The resulting non-linear relationship between inequality and steady state
 production are anlaysed in the chapter.

The consumer response to relative income has appealed to economists since
 at least as far back as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

.
 While the post-war period of relative stability and life-style improvements
 have renewed an interest in the positional concerns (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond,HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), there remains a disconnect between the descriptive theories - which explain
 the effects of a consumer's social context on her choices - and the theories
 of long-term economic growth (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KayRadicalUncertainty2020,SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Status competitions may have been argued to be ubiquitous - but the empirical
 explorations of how the microeconomic behaviour of a status-seeking consumer
 could relate with the economic inequality are rare (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KnellInequalityStatusGrowth1999,HopkinsStatusInequalityGrowth2004,CorneoStatusGrowth2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for theoretical arguments).
 To assist such an exploration, we focus on two questions pertaining to
 inequality in the context of status competitions in the current chapter.
 First, we attempt to answer if investments towards status that contribute
 to future probable success - should increase or decrease with a rise in
 income inequality or not.
 Second, we clarify if income inequality contributes to consumer accumulations
 in the long-term through status competitions.
 In addressing these questions, we focus on status games that provide direct
 gains to the consumer - while treating the uncertainty in intergenerational
 or spatial mobility explicitly as probabilistic rewards from investments
 towards status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stylised model of a status game where gains are driven by one's investments
 follows a contest-theory approach (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TullockEfficientRentSeeking2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) where the consumer's accumulations are constrained with the long-term
 stability of consumer populations.
 The status goals and economic goals of the consumer are treated equivalent
 in this approach - a feature that bears similarity with model proposed
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"

 where status is viewed as a ranking device for non-transactional environments
 directly influencing the consumer income.
 Simply put, our approach equates the status goals of the consumer with
 her economic goals - viewing status as the expected secure wealth maximised
 by the consumer.
 Status consumption then becomes the investments or cost to participate
 in a tiered rewards game.
 The approach may be of a limited value in cases where status consumption
 is treated as necessarily futile, but a view of status consumption as investmen
ts towards economic status is relevant for growing economies that provide
 new opportunities to gain wealth amidst an environment of severe income
 inequalities.

\begin_layout Standard
As such, the recent debates surrounding the two questions that we address
 in the current chapter seem to offer little clarity on the relationship
 of status consumption with inequality in an economy.
 A contradiction seems to persist for the first question since there are
 contrasting views in the literature on whether inequality has a negative
 or positive effect on status consumption.
 The post-war literature on status competitions argues that a fall in income
 inequalities and improvement in life-standards has resulted in a higher
 focus on status goods (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithAffluent,GalbraithBeyondContentment1994,GalbraithEssential"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) while the empirical literature finds more often that status consumption
 increases with rising inequality.
 It is worth emphasising that the sociological observations of increased
 status needs in response to falling inequality in the post-war era are
 associated with normative rather than descriptive concerns.
 Therefore, it need not follow from such observations that consumers feel
 a higher need for status as the inequality rises (or vice versa) - only
 that the avenues for indicating status may decline as the life-standards
 become uniform with decrease in income inequality (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HarrodGrowth1958,HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When equipped with subjective welfare data, the recent empirical analyses
 on how status competitions could relate to observed income inequality have
 instead found a positive effect of income inequality on status consumption.
 In other words, it is more often - particularly in the developing world
 - that status consumption increases with rising inequality.
 In a study focusing on education expenses for status purposes in China,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JinLiInequalityStatusConsumption2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find, for example, that higher inequality increases the consumption towards
 status.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 also report that consumers in India have increased conspicuous consumption
 with rise in inequality.
 An appropriate line of research has been to examine the environment where
 inequality is experienced (often relying on social attitudes surveys).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MijsInequalityMobility2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, for example, use the data from International Social Survey to detail how
 a rise in inequality might have cemented a belief in meritocracy in the
 developed economies and coincided with segregation rather than a healthy
 competition.
 A causal relationship between inequality and status consumption remain
 elusive since the growth environment as well as social context of an economy
 create an evident omitted variable bias for empirical studies.
 Thus the demands for status could be different in a rising economy than
 in a stagnant economy or vary within the same country due to significant
 income-segregation (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011,MinkoffLyonsIncomePerceptionsUnderIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since status competitions are tied with particular social contexts, an
 econometric analysis must also deal with the environment where inequality
 is experienced.
 The effect of income opportunities and resource-constraints on status competiti
ons is thus an important consideration for the current chapter.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second question examines if an increase in status consumption could
 result in more or less accumulations for the consumers.
 The debates on the relationship between inequality and growth in the literature
 have been divisive.
 The conventional wisdom has relied on the early works from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KuznetsEconomicGrowthIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who had argued that inequality rises in a country's early (agrarian) stages
 of economic development before declining as its economy matures (industrialises
).
 However, later empirical works have argued for both positive and negative
 effects of inequality on long-term economic growth.
 Those who argue for a positive effect of inequality on growth often emphasise
 how inequality helps innovation (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FoellmiZweimullerIncomedistribInnovations2006"

\end_inset

) and supports high-return projects (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenzweigBinswangerWealtRiskProfitability1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The negative effect of inequality on growth has been argued through unfavourabl
e fiscal policies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PerottiGrowthIncomeDis1993"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), political instability (

) or decline in human capital (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GalorZeiraIncomeDistrMacro1993,BergOstryInequalityGrowthPanel2018"

\end_inset

).
 Unless a particular mechanism of growth is inspected, an omitted variable
 bias is likely in such international comparisons as well (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ForbesReassessmentInequalityGrowth2000,BanerjeeDufloInequalityGrowth2003"

\end_inset

).
 More importantly, one must also consider the time-period over which growth
 is measured (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HalterInequalityGrowthTime2014,BanerjeeDufloInequalityGrowth2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HalterInequalityGrowthTime2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 elucidate, the positive effects of inequality tend to be short-term while
 the negative effects are often long-term.
 More recent empirical approaches have highlighted the role of inequality
 in opportunity towards growth in the economy (

LatexCommand cite
key "AiyarInequalityOpportunity,BradburyTriestInequalityofOpportunityAggEconPerf2016,MarreroRodriguezInequalityOpportunityVsEffort2013"

 Interpreted as non-necessary consumption, status consumption has also been
 explored as a mechanism that could affect growth.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 have highlighted that the positive effect of inequality on growth hinges
 on how the society treats its lowest individuals.
 The proposed model in the current chapter focuses only on the accumulations
 for the consumers rather the the growth in the economy and finds that the
 total consumer accumulations (for the poor as well as the rich) decline
 in an economy if economic inequality rises while all consumers participating
 in status competitions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that unlike in the literature on visible consumption,
 the status competitions in this stylised model are not wasteful.
 While the long-term income inequalities are permanent in the model (as
 is often the case - particularly in the developing economies), the consumers
 are allowed to transition through income bands through investments towards
 status (economic) gain with a certain probability.
 The probabilistic transition implies both a promotion and demotion of a
 consumer to the higher and lower income-bands in the economy.
 The basic set up relies on the observation first made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HarrodGrowth1958"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that social mobility and status are constrained due to necessarily limited
 positions for high status.
 With the consumer needs fixed for a given income-band, a consumer obtains
 a fixed disposable income by merely belonging to the income band (at a
 a given time) and the only sense of status in the economy is derived from
 the expected accumulated wealth at a certain risk over the long term.
 The status competitions in every income band provide an uncertain transition
 to a richer income band (except for the richest band) - a transition whose
 probability is increased by higher expenditure towards status.
 Similarly, the probability of demotion to a lower income band is reduced
 with a higher expenditure towards status.
 While status competitions are ubiquitous in the model through participation
 of all consumers (a representative consumer in each band), the status competiti
ons are constrained by the transition functions that limit high status to
 a small section of society.
 With an approach that equates economic goals with goals of social status,
 the status is achieved in the process of the consumer's maximisation of
 the consumer's projected assets-accumulation using the incomes received
 from the variety of income strata she may belong to in the future (due
 to transitions through the income bands).
 The key feature of this model is that it outlines a particular set of functions
 for such mobility across income bands and considers the constraints that
 the mobility functions must conform to.

\begin_layout Standard
The solution of the dynamic equilibrium implied by the above model that
 we use to answer the two questions relies on two conditions.
 First is a condition of population stability i.e.
 the long-term stability of sub-populations within these bands that ensures
 the number of consumers leaving a band being balanced with the number entering
 the band.
 The second condition is the ordering of utilities for richer and poorer
 consumer in a society.
 Since the recurrent bands (nodes) in the model are the poorest and the
 richest bands, a particular ordering of how rich and poor consumers benefit
 from their respective utilities from accumulated wealth is assumed for
 two bands in the economy.
 In the long-term equilibrium under these conditions, a consumer balances
 the accumulation of her wealth at risk with maintenance of a fair chance
 to improve (or hold) her socioeconomic position.
 In this simplified consideration of two-income bands, we then discuss the
 implications from rising income equality on the steady state levels of
 status consumption - seen as investments - as well as the long-term asset
 accumulations.
 While the game does permit a zero investment by either of the consumers
 (i.e.
 a withdrawal from the status competition), a non-zero investment for both
 the consumers means that the rich consumer must not find the investment
 for promotion - that the poorer consumer is offered a chance to be rich
 with - to be too little and the poorer consumer must not find that there
 is nothing on offer for mobility through status competitions to the richer
 position.
 In other words, the zero-consumption from either of the consumer does not
 constitute an equilibrium where both poor and rich consumers participate
 in the status competition.

One of the implications of the two long-term equilibrium conditions - i.e.
 the conditions of band population stability and the ordering of rich and
 poor asset utilities - is that the expenditure towards status for the poorer
 consumer need not decline with narrowing of income differences in the long-term.
 Equivalently, the costs to maintain the high accumulation for the richer
 consumer may rise with narrowing of income differences in the long-term.
 Given the evidence of myopia of consumption (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "false"

\end_inset

), one is often concerned with the consumer motivations in the short-term.
 The implication of the long-term equilibrium are - on the other hand -
 different from the short-term competition where wider income differences
 (rise in inequality) always intensify status competitions (i.e.
 increase the expenditure towards status).
 This serves as a key insight towards the first question we're interested
 in.
 While wider income differences (rise in inequality) tend to intensify status
 competitions and should increase the expenditure towards status in the
 short-term (as is validated by empirical assessments discussed above),
 the long-term equilibrium conditions of population stability imply a different
 dynamics where the wider income differences may act to reduce expenditure
 towards status by making band-promotion more difficult (for the poor consumers)
 and band-security cheaper (for the richer consumers).
 Similarly, a narrowing of income-differences in the long-term increases
 the value of (utility from) the expenditure towards status for poorer consumers
 - so that the poorer consumers spend less on status investments while the
 richer consumers raise their expenditure towards status to maintain their
 position of wealth in the long-term.
 Inequality can thus have a separating effect of pushing status-related
 investments away from each other in the long-term so that it discourages
 investments towards status in the stylised model.

Focusing on the net accumulations for the consumers in the steady state,
 we also show that asset accumulations can either decline or rise with inequalit
y depending on the transition functions - so long as the population stability
 criterion is maintained.
 In other words, a consumer may strive for more mobility in the short-term
 as income differences rise, but if the long-equilibrium were to move from
 a low-income differences (income inequality) setting to a higher income-differe
nces setting, it is possible that poor consumer withdraws from the status
 competitions (zero status investment).
 The net effect of inequality on growth is thus determined by how the combined
 asset accumulation for the rich and the poor rise or fall with inequality
 in the long-term equilibrium.
 This also means that inequality could rise while maintaining the same steady-st
ate growth in the model - so that a decline in poor consumer's investments
 towards status are compensated by the rise in rich consumer's investments
 towards status.
 If one may view the demotion in the model as equivalent of a redistribution
 mechanism, the particular results are similar to those arrived at by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 using a prisoner's dilemma formulation with possible expropriation of a
 common pool of assets.
 In other words, the long-term equilibrium results suggest that inequality
 may increase redistribution through rise in investments for status.

The contest-theory approach followed in the chapter is more general and
 may be better suited for examining the effect of inequality on expenditures
 such as education - which are not always wasteful (particularly in developing
 economies) and provide a real, albeit uncertain, opportunity for gain in
 positional or economic improvement.
 As social customs typically lag behind the rapid changes through introduction
 of newer occupation-related contests experienced in many such developing
 economies, the long-term income inequalities can be assumed to be as stable
 as the status competitions that represent institutional structures which
 maintain social hierarchies.
 Under these settings, one can both make the case for a positive externality
 from status games (

 and argue more generally that consumer welfare is derived from contests
 for achieving status (

 We thus avoid a utility based on wasteful consumption (

) in the current chapter.
 Other than the appropriateness of status games for expenses such as education,
 there are two further advantages of the explicit treatment of uncertainty
 in status gains with the contest-theory approach.
 First, fewer assumptions are needed on savings behaviour of the consumer
 (such as a constant savings rate) and the steady state of growth (such
 as a knowledge spill-over assumption in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BenabouInequalityGrowth1996,KnellInequalityStatusGrowth1999"

) - as the constraints of population stability in income bands are directly
 factored in.
 Second, the model may be better suited for empirical measurement of status
 consumption where income disparities are more readily observed than the
 reference level consumption.

The results from the model contribute to the literature in a few different
 ways.
 First, the framework with uncertainty in consumer choice proposed in the
 chapter may be better suited for incorporating choices that affect intergenerat
ional or spatial mobility (including social hierarchy) that in turn correspond
 to material gain from status competitions.
 Second, the model addresses status-related investments in education or
 professional club memberships that are often ignored in the discussion
 of status consumption due to possible contribution to consumer wealth from
 such investments.
 Third, it establishes that the steady state conditions for composition
 of populations in income-bands are enough to reverse the appeal for investment
 towards status.
 The findings from the chapter have a fundamental implication for policy
 - that while income inequality may motivate the consumer in the short-run,
 the long-term equilibrium would result in a social ossification.

To sum up, while a certain mobility through status competitions may provide
 stability (through perceptions of fairness in competitions) in an economy
 where stability of income-differences in the long-term widens the differences
 in accumulated wealth (through inheritance etc.), the conditions for long-term
 stability may reverse the implications of the widening of income differences
 on status competitions that are implied in the short-term.

 The current chapter focuses on how the uncertainty in a transition to bands

 could influence the investments towards status.
 The notion of uncertainty in the model encompasses the indeterminate processes
 of promotion to social positions that directly influence the income towards
 accumulations.
 The status competitions as a game for long-term asset accumulations under

Despite this similarity with the contest-theory approach first proposed
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TullockEfficientRentSeeking2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, there are some key differences between our approach and the Tullock competitio
n.
 While the status game - much like a Tullock competition - is a full information
 game, the approach in the current chapter is more concerned with the implicatio
ns of a long-term equilibrium than the sequential setting that is at the
 heart of a Tullock contest.
 Further, instead of operating as Tullock's bidding competition, our model
 uses a logistic probability function for transition across income bands
 that is constrained by population stability of income bands and a particular
 ordering of asset utilities for consumers in income bands.
 The probability function used in the model is thus different from that
 in the Tullock contest - which has a unique probability function necessitated
 by its setting (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kooremanTullockProbability1997"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Also, since the number of players is fixed in the long-term equilibrium
 due to the population stability condition, the issue of multiple players

 Finally, in contrast with the discussions of the short-term (symmetric)
 Nash equilibria for Tullock rent-seeking games with a discrete strategy(see

It is worth highlighting that the conditions on the feasibility of transition
 probability also address the issue of dissipation - the total invested
 resources in the rent-seeking game being less than the total rents - an
 issue that is not considered in the original Tullock contest.
 More specifically, the original Tullock competition does not consider that
 the total rent would be lower than the total resources invested in rent-seeking
 (

 A useful extension is offered by

 by considering an external agent who profits from selling input to the

 Tullock contest so that the profit for the external agent in the setup
 is maximised - an issue that is addressed indirectly in our model through
 the long-term equilibrium conditions for the particular status promotion
 probability function.

The view of status as an economic goal that corresponds to a possible future

 unlike the view of status signaling used in many studies on conspicuous

 More particularly, the visible consumption studies consider a utility from
 status consumption that is both necessarily futile and entirely separable
 from a private (non-visible) utility.
 Our specific consideration of status - an approach that equates the social
 goals of the consumer with her long-term economic goals - bears more similarity
 with the approach followed by

 goals in an unequal setting also takes into consideration the recent insights
 in the inequality and growth problem that have emphasised the role played
 by opportunities for the poorer sections in an economy (

As we detail in the next section, the optimal status consumption in the
 model entails a balance between i) the consumers in the higher income band
 who are favoured in the game due to higher income and ii) the poorer consumers
 who participate in the game only as long as there is some probability to
 improve their future wealth.
 To investigate the effect of inequality, we focus on how higher income
 differences may increase the investment towards status when there are two
 particular constraints for the game in the long term - namely the population
 constraint and a particular ordering of utilities from assets for the richer
 and poorer consumers.

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the proposed model is to explain how status consumption - viewed
 as investments towards maintaining long-term wealth - could change in response
 to income differences across disparate bands.
 The consumer's mere belonging to these bands implies a particular disposable
 incomes for the consumer i.e.
 a consumer obtains a certain disposable by merely being in a band.
 More formally, the consumers in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 obtain a disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in any given period.
 The choice faced by the consumer faces is to either i) save for a gain
 the utility from assets while staying in her current income band or ii)
 spend a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 out of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 while staying in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to participate in a status competition that may promote her to a higher
 income band in a certain probability depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 or demote her to a band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a certain probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 We assume no credit line towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 so that a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 with expenditure towards status
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{k}$
\end_inset

 always has 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{k}\le y_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the income bands range from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in an economy so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}<y_{k+1}\forall k\in[1,n-1]$
\end_inset

, we associate a probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 with the promotion of a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to the next income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is not defined for the highest band 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer could also be demoted to an immediate lower income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the lowest band 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected utility from the future assets in the respective
 income bands she may be in the future.
 The incomes are distinguished based solely upon rewards of status competitions
 i.e.
 the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1...n}$
\end_inset

 that are provided in the respective income band (the disposable income
 excludes the cost of a consumer's needs and is the same for all consumers
 in a particular asset-band).
 We summarise the assumption as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:def_band"

\end_inset

The incomes bands are characterised only by the levels of disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every consumer strives to achieve the highest assets in the economy.
 Since the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every band can be used to accumulate towards assets under risk of loss
 or participate in tournaments of unobserved ability, the wealth differences
 among consumers in this economy arise only due to their performance in
 status competitions.
 The status competitions are meant to arise due to institutional arrangements
 that grant some mobility across income bands while not completely getting
 rid of the stratification that prevents more participation.
 In other words, the success in status competitions serves both as an evidence
 of ability and as a barrier to entry for those with less proven abilities.
 The ability pertinent to one's status may thus be innate, unobserved and
 responsible for success in the status competitions, but it is relevant
 only through probabilistic monetary success in the long-term and is revealed
 to the consumer only through status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in income across bands makes the the competition biased
 in favour of the high spender, so that more expenditure towards status
 increases the probability of one's successes in the status competitions
 through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and decreases that of failure 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is defined so that a consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is rewarded more often and so that no amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can ever provide guarantee to be in the next band (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also assume that the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 have the same structure across income bands i.e.
 their dependence on

The mechanism for the competitions are fundamentally the same across all
 bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lower band (e.g.
 a poorer underlcass in an economy or a poorer country in the global economy)
 may thus have a lower base-level expenditure towards status (e.g.
 mean) but the outperformers in a poor environment are expected to improve
 their fortunes through the same mechanism that a consumer in a higher-income
 band would.
 This is a fundamental assumption for the status competitions in the model
 that determines the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising again that the consumers of varying characteristics
 (age, skills, talent etc.) observe the same likelihood of promotion to the
 next band as long as they are in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 for band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 offer exactly the same probability to all the consumers in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Further, since the status competitions in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 to be promoted to band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are not open to any consumers in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that is lower than the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

, it follows that for a consumer to be in a band higher than the next she
 must go through the next band.
 A consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can reach to another band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 only by going through bands 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1,...,j-1$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, a Markovian property is implied for the consumer's future
 utility from assets.
 In other words, status is the expected future utility at any point that
 the consumers maximise with the income received in their income band by
 either staying in the same band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or having moved to any of the bands different from their own.
 This scheme of transitions implied by this property in an economy of 
\begin_inset Formula $1...n$

 bands is shown in Figure

 - which in turn determines the future expected value of assets.

The above set up for status competitions implies a short-term equilibrium
 as consumers maximise the total accumulated assets in their band-reference
 within a given (finite) period of time.
 While the assets to be maximised are may be at risk of loss in the long-term,
 the short-term optimisation must be unaware of the assets being lost in
 the short-term finite horizon.
 For the discussion of the short-term equilibrium, therefore, we use an
 economy of two bands represented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 Without loss of generality, we consider the equilibrium when the consumers
 in the economy comprising of a poor band 1 and a rich band 2 maximise the
 assets accumulated in a single (finite) period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice first that the consumer in the two-band economy can either be demoted
 or promoted over time and her expected future wealth would be the expected
 sum of incomes from the future bands she can be in over the finite time-horizon.
 In the Markov chain implied in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"

\end_inset

, the future state of the consumer is thus based on either of the future
 bands she could be in with the respective probabilities associated with
 the transition i.e.
 the consumer in band 1 could expect to have either 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 income in the next period with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $1-W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 In the period after next, she could be in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{1}$

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and so on in further periods.
 Similarly, the consumer in band 2 could be in band 1 or 2 in the next period
 with the respective probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-L_{2}(\nu)$

Considering the optimisation of expected utility over a (finite) two-periods,
 the representative consumer in the two-bands economy has - as it were -
 just one life and the one-shot-investment for her life-time status as she
 maximises the utility from assets under no risk.
 The probability functions associated with the promotion and demotion 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$

 respectively are shown in Figure

.
 In the short-term finite horizon equilibrium, the representative consumer
 must maximise the assets at the end of the first-time horizon.
 It being a finite time-horizon, the consumer is not expected to spend on
 expenditure towards status at the end of her life.
 Thus, as is common in the applications of the life-cycle model (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

), the finite-time horizon optimisation means that the consumer isn't concerned
 with the life after the time-horizon.
 In other words, the short-term equilibrium requires that the consumer does
 not worry about her poorer or richer future state expect for the final
 assets at the end of time finite time-horizon.
 We thus set the expenditure towards status 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 in the last period as zero for all the consumers regardless of the value
 of assets they have amassed.

 As suppressing

 lower relative incomes may give the consumers more incentives to improve
 their well-being may still hold but only as long as the status competitions
 are feasible.
 Equivalently for

 A change 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\equiv y_{2}-y_{1}$

% The promotion in income bands does not assume an existing distribution
 of success-determining qualities for the consumer.
 Unlike with the approach adopted by [#HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004],
 W(

nu) and L(
\backslash

 in the economy.
 Therefore the past success in status competitions is the only relevant
 determinant of success and the consumer identity.
 It can be argued that with institutions as the occupational or marriage
 markets, the consumers know about their abilities only through participation
 (through expenditures in education[#KonradStrategyDynamicsContests] or
 social activities) where their past success as well as starting wealth
 determine their future decisions of

For the purposes of our discussion on long-term conditions, we continue
 to use the simplified chain with only two income bands which the consumers
 can transition in between.
 The simplification - shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 - could be extended to higher bands (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FullChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) for empirical assessments but does not change the core of our arguments.
 The fundamental condition for long-term stability that we impose is that
 of the stability of income band populations.
 More specifically, the number of consumers who leave an income band in
 the long-run must be balanced by those entering the income band in the
 long-term.
 The essential claim that is inherent is that the consumers expectations
 are rational and are not detached from the population constraint.
 An equilibrium with long-term income inequalities thus cannot exist if
 not for such a population preserving status competition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long-term status competitions with a population preserving mechanism
 - are equivalent to a scheme where an equal number of consumers are selected
 in successive bands and swapped with each other at a certain cost (see
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:WinnersandlosersChainExchange"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 With such a swapping mechanism, if 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 represents the probability of a consumer moving from band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$

 (not defined for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=n$

It is worth emphasising that the long-term income inequalities without any
 redistribution (or a status competition defined as above) cannot provide
 a stable long-term equilibrium for asset values.
 More specifically, if we rule out any institutions of direct redistribution
 of income, the accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=\sum_{t}^{T}\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the disposable income for the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}=y_{i}\forall t$
\end_inset

 ) - would lead to divergent differences in accumulated wealth - unless
 there is a risk of loss associated with the accumulation of wealth so that
 accumulations remain bounded.
 While it may seem plausible that an equilibrium of assets under no risk
 but with different disposable incomes may arrive as long as the consumers
 can move across bands often enough through status competitions, it can
 be shown that no redistribution or status competition can allow for a long-term
 equilibrium of asset values in the above economy with unequal incomes (see
 Appendix II).
 Another way to say this is that status competitions under no risk of loss
 to assets can never be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a long-term equilibrium - since the redistribution implied through
 the random swap (i.e.
 transition in the long-term where assets are carried over with the consumer
 ) cannot lead to a steady state.
 The only exception to this rule is when there are no net gains at from
 expenditure towards status at all for either of the consumers i.e.
 status consumption is completely futile for asset gain purposes.
 When assets accumulated are under risk (for both rich and poor consumers),
 however, a stable steady state is easily achieved.

For details of the long-term equilibrium, we make another assumption stating
 that the functions

The above assumption allows us to consider an independent stochastic variable

 resets the

 being observed by both the consumers independently implies that the above
 set up also allows us to ignore the role of starting assets consider

 for both the consumers in the long-term.
 The consumer accumulations are expected to be reset at a time

 and the consumer thus minimises her accumulation at the time

\begin_layout Standard
The above long-term conditions imply that a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 makes the loss to a lower band more acceptable for the consumer in band
 2.
 A peer effect kicks in some sense - due to the fact that the richer consumer
 absorbs (replicates) the choice made by poorer consumers as she is demoted
 to band 1 and thus the choice of the poorer band is also factored into
 her choice in the starting period.
 Similarly, a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$

 might make staying in the poorer band more appealing for the consumer 1.

% Discontinuity: Before reset the the consumer accumulates and after the
 reset her asset disappears.
 The combined utility is maximised the final expected assets and the consumer
 cannot maximise at t=1 without considering what happens after (e.g.
 another consumer comes, L,W change etc.).
 Further, since the choice at t=1 is different from choice at t=0 if considering
 the next period alone, a single nu for two time periods can only be forced.
  The total assets which we consider are different in the current assets
 where the decision is being made.
 The same asset can be enjoyed more in the poorer band and that matters
 only when utilities are considered i.e.
 after summing them up over time.

% Discarding intertemporal substitution - The solution with intertemporal
 utility has the advantage that it provides a control for whether consumers
 care more about the long-term transition or the the accumulation.
 Long-term movements are not influenced by savings at all (all savings are
 meant to go to waste in the long run).
 This also allows us to

approximate

 the case with general  with a discount-factor.
 The intertemporal methods does however go against the central argument
 that consumers maximise long-term accumulations.
 We are left with no options but to rely on the same nu for both periods
 in order to explain the substitution between later and earlier risk.

The selection of

\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)=1$

\end_inset

.
 The same applies to the equivalent definition for 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 When considering the population stability in band, the above specification
 translates into a simple linear relationship between the parameters that
 we discuss below.
 While a

There are certain implications of the parameters for the nature of status
 competitions.
 First, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 determines how sharp the probability of promotion 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 would rise with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 The plots of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$

 are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

, on the other hand, represents whether a significant rise in probability
 occurs for a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}$
\end_inset

) or relatively low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}$
\end_inset

).
 Roughly speaking, with 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 being the upward mobility in the two-consumer economy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is the degree of separation in bands imposed by the spending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 A high 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 differentiates the outcome of those having low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from those having higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 more clearly.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}$
\end_inset

- on the other hand - is the minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for there to be a probability of transition to the next income band.
 It thus represents the level of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 at which status competitions become significant in the economy.
 We focus on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

 implied by long-term equilibria - since a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

 means a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 required for mobility and a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$

 means low mobility.

% [fixing 
\backslash
omega,

 on status consumption - because there is some difference in asset still.

 i) a sharp response to 
\backslash
nu i.e.
 high 
\backslash
omega or ii) a higher 
\backslash
bar{
\backslash
omega} so that there are no gains until a certain level is reached.
 Again magnitude of 
\backslash
omega does not seem to matter in our story - as it only seems to suggest
 a discreteness in competition i.e.
 whether the consumer below a certain threshold get no benefit at all.
 We do however see curvature effect on 
\backslash
omega - so setting 
\backslash
kappa
\backslash
ne1 seems one way to get a curvature to the poorer consumer - increasing
 lambda_bar also adds curvature to consumer 1 i.e.
 requiring a high

 Such a long-term solution which accommodates the population stability can
 be assumed to imply a planner that directs the various selections 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\bar{\nu}_{1},\bar{\nu}_{2}\}$
\end_inset

 implied by the above optimisation of above utilities.
 In other words, a combined utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 for both the consumers can be assumed to be maximised while the population
 stability conditions are implied.
 To explore a detailed numerical solution of the equilibrium, we therefore
 focus on a cooperative solution using a combined utility

 for both the consumers.

The level at which upward transition becomes significant raises poor consumer's
 expenditure towards status is less surprising.
 What's more interesting is the withdrawal of the poorer consumer from the
 status competition due to a higher status investment  by the richer consumer.
 The population constraint - under the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa>1$
\end_inset

 - readily provides the condition of withdrawal from status competitions
 for either of the consumers in the economy.
 More particularly, there would be no benefits to the consumer from expenditure
 towards status when either 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 is implied in the long-term.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are known in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\lambda}}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 are already known and fixed) for given utilities, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}{\kappa}+\overline{\lambda}=\overline{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 sets the 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 for a given level of security 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 that must exist for there to be a status competition with non-zero 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, for consumer 1 to participate in the status competition,
 the consumer 2 must choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}<\frac{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}{\kappa}+\text{\underbar{\lambda}}$
\end_inset

 .
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

 implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\kappa\underline{\lambda}+\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 if the consumer 1 spends more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa\underline{\lambda}+\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

, the likelihood of her getting into the richer band is so high relative
 to the security offered to the consumer 2 through status competition that
 there would be no reason for any expenditure towards status for the richer
 consumer.
 Notice that these constraints indeed uphold for any utility maximised by
 the consumer.

 In other words, the values for

\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$

 then corresponds to the maximal combined utility for the two consumers.
 This combined utility for the two consumers can be viewed as the Pareto-goal

 A parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is used in this combined utility to controls for whether the Pareto goal
 relies more on the richer consumer than the poorer consumer.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 could indicate how labour-intensive an economy may be or how segregated
 (in terms of the population) the rich and the poor are in the economy.
 For the purposes of our discussion, it suffices that a given long-term
 income difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a particular

Case II:

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\mathscr{U}}{\partial\underline{\lambda}}=0$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the unconstrained maximum for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 after 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is eliminated using the population stability condition (see below for details).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case I, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}+\bar{\nu}_{2}=\xi$
\end_inset

 (with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\ne0$
\end_inset

 ) directly leads to a solution dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
\bar{\nu}_{1}=G(\lambda,\underline{\lambda},\text{\ensuremath{\omega},\ensuremath{\underline{\omega}}},y_{1},y_{2})=\frac{\lambda\xi-\omega\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}-\underbar{\ensuremath{\lambda}\lambda}}{\lambda-\omega}

or,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
As long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>\lambda$
\end_inset

, an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 would decrease 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and a decrease in 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 would increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Finiteness constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}^{*}+\bar{\nu}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 therefore suppress the status investments for the poorer consumer.
 Further, as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is an increasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 increasing income difference between the two consumers always increases
 the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>\lambda$
\end_inset

 would mean that an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 would decrease 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and a decrease in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 would increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
\frac{\partial G}{\partial\Delta}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{\omega}{\lambda}}\frac{\partial\xi}{\partial\Delta}

The results for Case II i.e.
 of local-maximisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},u_{2}$
\end_inset

 when

 is high enough are less straightforward since both 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},u_{2}$
\end_inset

 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\nu),\psi(\nu)$
\end_inset

 - whose specific forms have not been yet assumed in the solution.
 Considering a specific form for 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\Gamma\cdot A^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and the population stability condition (see Appendix III), the three unknowns
 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega},\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 (with fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda,\omega$
\end_inset

 ) can be solved using the conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u_{1}}{\partial\bar{\nu}_{1}}=0$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial\bar{\nu}_{1}}=0$
\end_inset

 and the optimisation of the combined utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:combined_utility"

\end_inset

).
 So long as the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 ensures that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a concave function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

, we can ascertain that a unique 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 would maximise the combined utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

.
 Such a solution depends however on the particular form of combined utility
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

.
 The form of a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the Pareto concern of how the asset utilities from poor and richer consumer
 are combined in a society thus form an important caveat for the effect
 of income differences on consumer selections 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 A simple setting of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}(u_{1},u_{2})=\beta u_{1}+(1-\beta)u_{2}$
\end_inset

 where both consumers are better off with more assets (higher utilities
 from assets) - that we explore numerically in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 - does not guarantee that the consumers would decrease status investments
 with lowering of income differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that there are two factors in the cooperative solution with population
 stability that balance the increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the long-run.
 First is that the poorer consumer eventually runs out of budget 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 if the 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 is a lot higher (i.e.
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is very high) and exercises 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 instead.
 Second is that the richer consumer withdraws with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 if the poorer consumer gets the promotion to a higher band very easily.
 Both of these both factors - are a result of the population stability condition
 and are thus independent of the combined utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

.
 As these factors would continue to hold for a non-cooperative solution,
 we can argue that the above dynamics for the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the long-run remain unchanged for a non-cooperative solution as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the goal of using the two conditions is to explore the effects
 of income difference 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on status competitions while incorporating the changes in competitions
 that occur to rise or fall in income-differences in the long-term.
 With the parameters controlling a specific form of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 endogenised within the equilibrium conditions, we are able to remedy the
 earlier issue with the short-term equilibrium that changes in income also
 change the competitions and 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 themselves.
 Unlike with the short-term equilibrium, in other words, the changes in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 correspond to a different 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$

\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 characterised by 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 As we show with numerical methods, this relationship does not necessarily
 result in consumers always increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in response to rise in income differences.

 (

 However, both extremely low and high values of

 An extremely low

 makes the promotion extremely easy and causes the consumer 2 to withdraw
 i.e.
 reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 This is because the richer consumer would no longer be concerned with demotion
 if the opportunities to rise to the richer position are plenty.
 Similarly, an extremely high 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 causes the (poorer) consumer 1 to withdraw due to the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}<y_{1}$
\end_inset

It is also evident from the numerical methods that a widening of income
 differences would result in a higher expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 from consumer 1 if the consumer 2 withdraws from the competition.
 This is because the benefits from higher investments into status are higher
 if the other consumer does not participate.

 As the figure shows, the very low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 only make the status competition lucrative for the poorer consumer.
 However, there is only a certain level of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\equiv y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

until which high income differences encourage only consumer 1 to increase
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 - a level after which both consumers participate so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 rises by as much that the poorer consumer is no longer able to afford raising
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 , the optimal choice for consumer 1 is to reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 - thus letting consumer 2 pay for the high security implied by high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, an extremely large change in income differences reverses
 the withdrawal among the consumers - since a shift from low-income differences
 to high income-differences (through lowering of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

) causes the poorer consumer to no longer view any benefit from the status
 investment - a situation where any further rise in income differences only
 increases the investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 for consumer 2.
 Likewise, a shift from high-income differences to largely-similar income-differ
ences would mean that the richer consumer no longer sees any benefit from
 participating in the status competition - thus setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 to zero.
 Therefore, the lower differences in income - which is used to accumulate
 assets in the long-term - are as undesirable for the richer consumer as
 higher differences in income are for the poorer consumer.
 A widening in income-differences increases 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 - only until it becomes so high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is reduced to zero by the consumer 1.
 Similarly, a lowering of income differences decreases 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 until the incomes are so equal that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is reduced to zero.

The equilibrium levels of asset accumulations also correspond to the choices
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$

 An equilibrium with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily mean lower asset accumulations - since status investments
 also contribute to asset accumulation through social promotion in the model.
 The total asset accumulations implied by the selections 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$

\end_inset

 rise with rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 remains the same.
 With changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

, the total assets decline for the poorer consumer on withdrawal (i.e.
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

) and they rise for consumer 2 with rise in income difference.
 As the plots in Figure

 show, a high 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}+A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is achieved when all of the poorer consumer's disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is spent towards status investments.
 The withdrawal from status investments lowers the total accumulation 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}+A_{2}$
\end_inset

 until the point when changes in income difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 become so high that all gains through status investments only benefit the
 richer consumer.
 The result that total assets are higher either when status investments
 are at highest possible values for the poor consumer or when they benefit
 only the richer consumer in the long-term does confirm the intuition as
 well.

 Such an increase in equality will also increase conspicuous  waste by those
 on middle incomes or low and middle incomes, while conspicuous consumption
 by the rich may decrease (our finding too).
 consequently, when we consider corrective taxes on conspicuous consumption,
 we find that the more equally income is distributed, the higher taxes and
 subsidies should be for those with low to middle incomes, and the lower
 they should be  or those with high incomes.
 Indeed, we are able to show that in some circumstances a corrective policy
 with higher tax rates (but also higher subsidies) for those with low incomes
 can lead to a Pareto improvement

We had set ourselves to find how income inequality could influence status
 consumption as investments in an economy.
 Interpreting status consumption as investments or efforts spent towards
 economic status, we use a two-band economy under the conditions of population
 stability and a known ordering of asset utilities for consumers to argue
 that a rise in income inequalities need not always raise status consumption
 in the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conditions that population stability must prevail in a long-term equilibrium
 of income bands and that there exists a known ordering for asset utilities
 for the rich and poor consumer - together imply that the expenditure towards
 status for the poorer (richer) consumer need not rise (fall) with increase
 in income differences since withdrawal of either the rich or the poor consumer.
 This is because an increase (decrease) in income inequalities can drive
 an increase (decrease) in status investments only as long as the poorer
 (richer) consumer does not withdraw from the status game - finding it no
 longer lucrative for positional improvement in the game.
 Thus, while it is tempting to argue using the short-term equilibrium conditions
 that wider income differences make status competitions more stringent and
 the expenditure towards status higher (lower) for the poorer (richer) consumer,
 the long-term equilibrium - under conditions of population stability and
 a known order of asset utilities for the rich and the poor consumer - imply
 a different dynamics where wide income differences could reduce expenditure
 towards status by making promotion difficult (for the poor consumers) or
 security cheaper (for the richer consumers).
 This also means that the combined asset accumulations for the rich and
 the poor consumer - might either rise or fall with higher income inequality.

There are two important caveats to the above result that we must also highlight.
 First is that the cooperative solution rests on a certain ordering of combined
 utility for rich and poor consumers.
 Second is that a risk with the accumulated wealth is necessary for there
 to be a status competition at all - one that promises income opportunities
 and securities to the respective positions in a finite-bands setting.
 In other words, an inequality in bands cannot maintain a steady state competiti
on without an inherent risk that sets an upper bound on wealth accumulation
 for the richer consumer.

In applications where consumer welfare follows from status investments such

es how long-term constraints due to finite resources could lower the participati

% [Next: greed and loss-aversion] When consumers have a preference for lower
 assets in the low band, the introduction of greed or contentment would
 can shift the equilibrium further.
 Contentment is just the name of loss-aversion associated.
 Consumers might be less loss-averse with respect to A_{0} in which case
 they are more content with lower than A_{0}.
 On the other hand, they might be in a regime where consumers don't like
 being less than A_{0} at all.
 We look at the contentment vs aspiration in the above setup for a given
 
\backslash
kappa .
 The consumer utility uses a reference function defined around long-term
 A_{0} so that there are two regimes.
 First, where being poor may not become successively bad.
 Second, is the regime where contentment is valuable and the consumer below
 A_{0} don't mind it too much compared to how much consumers with more wealth...
 .
 The other regime is when consumer are more greedy and people mind being
 poor a lot compared to being rich.
 We see how either of these regimes are influenced by 
\backslash
kappa vs y_{2}-y_{1}(This way we don't need to deal with measurement of
 g1/g2 but we can argue only what greed and contentment with assets implies).
 Greed can help us relieve the stringent

\begin_layout Proof
The above condition implies that the consumer balances her expected future

 The net asset value from being either in band 1 or band 2 would be balanced
 by the expected returns the consumer 1 gets from putting up 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 towards status competitions.
 Since the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 must be positive and less than unity, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{2})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 must be less than zero.
 In other words, the consumer in band 1 must move from a negative net asset-valu
e to a positive asset value in band 2 (or vice versa).
 Similarly, for the consumer in band 2, the following quantity must amount
 to zero in the long-term equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
As long as status competition is feasible for consumer 1, she should see
 an increase in the long-term net asset value by being in band 2.
 The possibility of moving from band 1 to band 2 only to observe the net
 asset value decline is ruled out because higher income bands are also meant
 to have a higher asset reference.
 Any peer effects associated with the assets would ensure a higher asset
 (comparative) reference in the higher asset-band.
 Thus while the consumer in band 1 cannot afford to have a decline in net
 asset value if she moves to the next band, the consumer in the rich band
 might accept a poorer band with a net increase in asset value.
 This implies that the the net asset-value function must be concave (see

).

\begin_layout Proof
However, the long-term equilibrium also ensures that the consumer arriving
 from the different band gathers no more assets than other consumers in
 the same band.
 Thus, we also have

%A concave net asset value function eventually corresponds to convex costs
 associated with the asset - which is plausible when there costs increase
 both for extremely high wealth levels and for extremely low wealth levels.

Thus, the consumer must see no net gain on average from participating in
 the status competition for

 and

 The population constraint therefore implies that

\end_inset

 as the only possible equilibrium when no new asset value is added by participat
ion in status competitions.
