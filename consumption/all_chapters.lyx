The aspirational consumption in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

base of pyramid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 countries - which constitute the poorer two-thirds of the world's population
 - has recorded a significant increase in recent years.
 The consumption continues to rise for the base of pyramid consumers while
 it already remains proportionately higher in comparison to the consumers
 of richer economies.
 To explain if such a rise may be subject to a leveling effect seen in developed
 economies, we consider aspirational consumption in a more general context
 with a link between status goals and economic goals of the consumer.
 The empirical analyses then attempt to assess whether a rise in aspirational
 consumption role may fall with urban development or not by exploring the
 role of household permanent income on food and education - both of which
 are observed to carry status value in sub-Saharan Africa.
 A first chapter provides theoretical arguments for effects of income inequality
 on relational capital investments which often amount to status consumption
 in developing economies.
 Considering that the quality of consumption may also indicate status in
 the more general sense of status consumption, a second empirical chapter
 examines variation in quality of food and a third chapter explores education
 as a type of consumption where quality is less relevant for status.
 The three chapters draw a set of independent conclusions on the effects
 of inequality on status consumption.
 The equilibrium conditions discussed in the first chapter for a model of
 status as a position hierarchy where consumers are able to move between
 through social capital investments reveal that positional contests can
 become uncompetitive with a rise in income inequality in the long-run.
 The chapter highlights two types of long-term equilibria where either only
 rich consumers participate with status investments or both rich and poor
 participate.
 The second chapter observes that the permanent income - alongside with
 availability of electricity in the country - may have a segregating effect
 on food quality in Tanzania.
 The third chapter finds that educations expenses in Nigeria are more significan
tly influenced by local wealth levels than permanent income.
 In light of the two long-term equilibria discussed in the first chapter,
 the empirical findings highlight the possibility of a rise in expenditure
 on status items as a common need when they are linked with perceptions
 of mobility.
 The study argues that broad generalisations of a rise in aspirational consumpti
on that focus only on visible consumption may ignore the varied role of
 economic inequality and mobility perceptions in developing economies.

 The empirical studies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) - much like in rest of
 the diverse developing world - often seem less concerned with why certain
 items should be treated as aspirational in their respective environments.
 The idea that certain goods must carry a visible appeal has been embraced
 - at times without examining the historical and cultural settings that
 might influence status perceptions in an economy

 Conversely, while consumption of clothing or personal products - regardless
 of variation in quality - are commonly considered visible consumption

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 in the developing economies, the literature also points to the necessity
 of such consumption by finding evidence of improvement in subjective well-being
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Aspirational consumption is commonly understood as consumption relevant
 for status signaling needs or social aspirations - but not only are the
 empirical tests of visible consumption across developing economies sensitive
 to extreme variation in cultural contexts, the very idea that visible consumpti
on is wasteful may also deserve scrutiny if a rising affluence of societies
 transitioning away from subsistence lifestyles (or endogenous growth) raises
 common needs across the society - either by elevating the quality of basic
 consumption (such as food, clothing) or by expanding the consumer basket
 into newer goods.
 The purported rise in aspirational consumption thus ought to be viewed
 in the backdrop of such fundamental socio-economic shifts and complex social
 histories of the developing economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presented study focuses on two shortcomings of the prevalent view of
 rise in aspirational consumption.
 First, it revisits the sociological basis for status in order to consider
 a broader view of status-related consumption than what is permitted with
 the notion of visible consumption.
 Second, it considers mobility perceptions as a potential factor for consumption
 changes in an environment of wide income differences.
 The issues are particularly relevant to SSA- first since a recent urbanisation
 of the region may still allow for status indication though higher quality
 as well as newer consumption types and second, since recent economic growth
 may prioritise mobility and its perceptions - resulting in the seemingly

 consumption becoming a social need with material consequences for the consumer.
 Drawing from the sociological literature for status 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{wegener1992prestigeconcepts}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the presented study links consumption with notions of aspiration to provide
 theoretical arguments for how aspirational consumption could change under
 income inequalities in developing economies.
 The empirical chapters in the study then examine distribution of consumption
 pertaining to status with respect to permanent income in SSA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more general view of aspirational consumption adopted in the study attempts
 to highlight how some of the claims of unusual or prominent urges towards
 aspirational consumption among the poor developing economies

status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

cite{subrahmanyanBoPConsumption2008,SrivastavaMukherjee2020aspcon}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - may in part be due to the lack of an established standard for maximal
 level of common needs in an economy.
 With there being well-known issues with a direct measurement of necessities
 of consumers 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

, the attribution of higher consumption to aspirational needs might be appropria
te in a normative sense, but frequent attributions of higher or lower wastefulne
ss to specific sections of society require one to reconcile the sociological
 basis for status needs in an economy as well - thus considering both the
 dynamics of status in the economy and the notion of wastefulness associated
 with certain consumption.
 In a theoretical exploration of how income differences may influence aspiration
al consumption (in a more general sense than what is implied by visible
 consumption), we therefore focus on a particular social value that the
 consumer may derive from aspirational consumption.
 Drawing from the literature on status in sociology 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{webereconomysociety1925,goode1978celebrationheroes,wegener1992prestigeconce
pts}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the theoretical first chapter assumes a specific link between economic
 and social goals of the individual to explain effect of income-inequalities
 on consumption - which are viewed as investments towards social capital
 needed to pursue social positions.
 The empirical chapters proceed to examine the distribution of exclusive
 and high-quality consumption that have been reported to carry status advantage
 in SSA but do not fall under visible goods category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth elaborating how the above view of aspirational consumption contrasts
 against that of conspicuous consumption as futile splurges of the rich
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{VeblenLeisureClass}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and how it motivates our exploration of income inequality effects.
 The distinction between the view of conspicuous consumption as splurges
 of the rich and that of a generalised status consumption is an important
 one since if high-priced consumption were to be limited only to those with
 higher income or wealth, then there are evident limits implied for the
 rise of such consumption 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{HirschSocialLimits}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In other words, the high-priced consumption - if limited to richer sections
 - is subject to how extreme income inequalities persist in the economy
 - since such consumption may rise only as much as the proportion of rich
 rises in a population.
 Therefore if aspirational consumption is strictly interpreted as trophies
 of the rich or as futile attempts to emulate the rich, then such consumption
 is necessarily limited to the rich and its purported rise cannot be widespread
 in an unequal society.
 With a more general view of aspirational consumption taken in the study
 on the other hand, the scope of aspirational consumption is necessarily
 wider as it concerns itself with how aspirational consumption may expand
 to the masses as a common need.
 The general view of aspirational consumption combined with the link between
 economic and social goals allows us to interpret the effects of mobility
 concerns on consumption as investments towards social capital towards economic
 gains 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{goode1978celebrationheroes,HirschSocialLimits}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for the consumer.
 As we further explain, such a general view may be better suited to reconciling
 the sociological bases for status in an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% Such a view of aspirational consumption does not make any claims on the
 consumer's intent in purchase of a specific item (i.e.

 diary data alone may not address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% We focus on the role of secondary-schools rather than tertiary-level schools

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical chapters in the study do not assume the existence of purely
 visible items and consider two ways in which high-consumption of status
 relevance can be availed in the cross-section of a typical sub-Saharan
 economy.
 The first type of consumption is one that can be viewed as a higher quality
 of a commonly consumed basic good.
 The second type is one that is altogether exclusive to the richer sections
 i.e.
 inaccessible to the vast majority.
 The primary distinction between the two-types of consumption in the study
 is an empirical one wherein the quality variation is relevant for the first
 type of consumption and it isn't for the second type.
 The rationale behind this distinction is that in a generic sense of status
 signaling (rather the one implied by futile goods alone), the available
 quality in the market makes it possible for a richer consumer to distinguish
 herself from the poorer consumer while an item with less lower-quality
 variants may be relevant for status purposes only through the poor being
 priced of purchasing such an item.
 One can hardly dispute that food is a basic necessity but there also seems
 evidence for status-indication through food quality in developing economies
 (e.g., for Tanzania
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{ohna2007foodstatus,ohna2012nofoodwougali}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Mass Education, on the other hand, is quite unlike food and is a relatively
 newer consumption type in SSA - with an evidence for its status value as
 well
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{MinnisNonformalEducation2006,porzio2021human}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first empirical chapter in the study inspects variation in food quality
 in Tanzania - which presents itself as an economy where rapid changes in
 consumption patterns have been highlighted under recent urban developments.
 The second empirical chapter compares education expenses in a rural economy
 with a relatively more urbanised one by selecting Tanzania and Nigeria
 - which are countries with disparate levels of industrial dependence.
 It is worth highlighting that all consumption - regardless of high or low
 quality - is surveyed across the cross-section in both the empirical chapters.
 Since consumption being limited a rich household must evidently limit the
 long-term rise in overall consumption in the economy, the role of household
 permanent-income is explored in both the empirical chapters so as to comment
 on possible future rises in consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such, many different scenarios may arise with food and education considered
 as the two types of aspirational consumption.
 With food quality, one could find that budget shares for food quality do
 not vary much across the population (as is the case for only a few specific
 food items) or that high food quality is severely limited to richer households.
 Similarly, with respect to education - which is more exclusive relative
 to food - one may find that it is affordable only to rich households or
 that it's availed across all income levels.
 A comparison of education expenses in Tanzania and Nigeria suggests that
 education is distributed across the population in asset-rich regions whereas
 a view of distribution of food quality in Tanzania shows that high quality
 is significantly limited to richer and urban households.
 The role of household permanent income appears to be less important for
 education in urbanised areas than for high quality food - suggesting how
 certain types of consumption - subject to changes in economic growth -
 are more likely to become a growing need in the population.
 These observations can be viewed in light of the theoretical findings of
 the first chapter on how persistent household income inequalities influence
 demand for status-goods varying in their potential mobility value.
 As we detail in the study and discuss further in the epilogue (Part 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{part:epilogue}
\end_layout

\end_inset

), education may be different from food not only through being a newer type
 of consumption category in the rural economies (which also allows the variation
 in quality to be of a less empirical concern) but also in how it may relate
 to future economic gains.
 A view of expenditures sensitive to perceptions of mobility (e.g., education
 ) that considers status neither a purely conspicuous concern nor a necessity
 may be better equipped to explaining upward pressures on certain aspects
 of aspirational consumption.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, a theoretical chapter in the presented study finds that long-term
 socio-economic income inequalities limit competitions for status even though
 such investments (i.e.
 aspirational consumption) rise with an increase in inequality in the short-term.
 The empirical assessments then find that while high expenditure for certain
 items may be limited to those with higher permanent income, the urbanisation-re
lated changes could have an effect of reducing the role of household permanent
 income on expenditure for certain consumption categories (while also creating
 wider differences between urbanised and rural areas).
 That richer consumers (those with higher wealth and/or income) are likely
 to have better access to higher quality goods and items that are out of
 reach for the masses is less surprising, but whether such consumption is
 likely to be limited to the richer sections of the society in an environment
 of wide differences in wealth and income levels depends much on the type
 of value the particular consumption may provide to the consumer rather
 than on notions of wastefulness - especially when the notions are not validated
 as a part of the status dynamics of an economy.
 The presented study urges more focus on mobility perceptions as such a
 value - which ought to be taken into account when examining changes in
 consumption in developing economies.

\begin_layout Abstract
Status motivations for consumption have generated an immense interest at
 a time when social mobility has been relatively stagnant - but the consequences
 of inequality within societies on patterns of development are still poorly
 understood.
 To explain status motivations under environments of income inequality,
 we treat opportunities for mobility as a link between economic and social
 goals of the individual and view the consumption as investments towards
 future economic success.
 Considering an economy with a dynamic hierarchy of rich and poor positions
 that consumers are able to move between, we then ask how relative incomes
 associated with each position may influence the agents’ consumption or
 labour supply decisions.
 With a diminishing returns to utility from wealth optimised by a consumer
 endowed with randomly distributed success-determining attributes and the
 promotion probabilities depending on her expenditure, we find that a rise
 in income inequality provides more incentive to participate in status competiti
ons.
 As consumers always bear participation costs for mobility, the long-term
 equilibrium conditions suggest two states for the economy - one where both
 rich and poor strive for status and the other where only the rich consumers
 participate in status competitions.

 In the context of aspirational consumption in the developing economies,
 such a disconnect makes it difficult to argue whether rises in aspirational
 consumption are a mere consequence of social shifts pertaining to growth
 and income redistribution in the economy or not.
 As the economies may vary significantly across institutional efficacy and
 socio-political environments, a prediction of rise in aspirational consumption
 is problematic unless one relies upon a well-defined mechanism relating
 relative income concerns and growth in the economy.
 We argue that a view of status goals as independent of economic concerns
 may not offer a satisfactory view of aspirational concerns in the developing
 economies.
 We thus attempt to use a specific link between economic and social goals
 to answer questions pertaining to effects on income inequality on aspirational
 consumption.
 The presented chapter focuses on a context of aspirational consumption
 where it can be treated as investments towards mobility and then asks whether
 such investments should increase or decrease with a rise in income inequality.

Given a significant variation in economic development across developing
 economies (such as Tanzania and Nigeria that we discuss further in Chapter
 2), the endogenisation of status in such a manner provides a generic framework
 to compare aspirational consumption across disparate developing economies
 that may have differing levels of urban development.
 With regards to the specific problem of how variation in urban institutions
 could influence expenditures such as education (that carry some status
 but also contribute to future income mobility), the proposed theoretical
 chapter considers how expenditure towards status could respond to changes
 in income differences and participation costs under the urbanisation-related
 changes.
 Unlike the typical attribution of status to exogenous and idiosyncratic
 factors such as race or caste in empirical studies, the presented approach
 views status as expectation of future incomes and treats higher urbanisation
 as an environment where purchasable social capital has a significant role
 to play towards towards individual success

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that such an explicit link between economic and social goals
 could also be key to addressing some of the debates in economics on whether
 inequality has a negative or positive effect on status consumption.
 More particularly, while the post-war literature on status competitions
 attributes a higher status consumption to a fall in income inequalities
 and improvement in life-standards 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithAffluent,GalbraithBeyondContentment1994,GalbraithEssential"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the empirical literature finds more often that status consumption increases
 with rising inequality.
 The disagreement seems at least partly due to the sociological observations
 of higher status needs being normative rather than descriptive concerns.
 More specifically, the observations of the post-war era - pertaining largely
 to the objective notions of status - do not suggest that consumers must
 feel a higher need for status as the inequality rises (or vice versa) -
 only that the avenues for indicating status have declined as the life-standards
 become uniform with decrease in income inequality 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HarrodGrowth1958,HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 When equipped with subjective welfare data, on the other hand, the recent
 empirical analyses - concerned with the subjection notions of status -
 find a positive effect of income inequality on status consumption instead.
 Since status competitions are tied with particular social contexts, an
 analysis of status consumption in a growing economy must deal both with
 the environment where inequality is experienced along with the growth in
 economy.
 A specific link between objective and subjective notions of status - where
 the former represents economic goals and the latter social goals for the
 individual - may thus allow us to better understand how inequality shapes
 consumption decisions in an economy.

To delineate the structural relationship between the economic and social
 goals of an individual, the current chapter uses probability functions
 for mobility that determine promotion to a richer class.
 While the probability of promotion for the consumer is driven by her expenditur
e and certain attributes of the individual, the utility for the consumer
 comes only from her accumulated wealth.
 Our approach where participants do not consider the rich status directly
 into the utility (and therefore do not directly maximise the chances to
 be rich) - follows 
\begin_inset ERT

 In the probabilistic game we use to represent status competitions, the
 participants compete both with raw talent and acquired skills (social capital)
 to get promoted to (or to maintain) a rich position.
 The winner of such a game is promoted to a rich position (or maintains
 her rich position) by having the maximum total score comprising both of
 raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (uniformly distributed in a population) and social capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (enhanced with expenditure).
 The social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 that is enhanced through expenditure is also subject to budget constraints
 imposed on the consumer
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We do not view leisure as separate from budget constraints in the model.
 In other words, the leisure relevant for higher stauts is interpreted simply
 as a higher cost for the poorer participant.
 So long as once can view leisure as the amount of money a participant must
 forgo in order to participate in status competition, the leisure differences
 can be thus also viewed as differences in disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the only two types of participants in the
 tournament view of status used in the current chapter are the poor and
 rich classes - so that the investments towards status (such as club-membership
 fees, or higher-education) increase the chances to be promoted to the rich
 status.
 The rich consumers in the game or those who benefit with a higher disposable
 income (
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

) solely on grounds of their rich status while the poor consumers are those
 who receive a disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 Those who don't participate in the tournament certainly suffer with being
 poor, but those who do spend only benefit probabilistically.
 A useful analogy to explain such a competition is that of tennis leagues
 - where rewards are risky but are unlike lotteries (in that - more expenditure
 does not linearly increase one's chance to win in a tennis championship).
 As with the game of tennis, participants with appropriate raw-talent and
 skills may exist naturally in a population but their success also depends
 on engagement with other tennis players.
 More specifically, there may exist biological characteristics such as strength,
 dexterity, height or psychological abilities (resilience, conscientiousness
 etc.) that help one's tennis, but there also exist several characteristics
 such as technique, rankings, knowledge of strings-compatibility, racket-customi
sations etc.
 that are only available at a significant cost to the participant.
 The enhancement of these latter skills (social capital) are what the expenditur
e-depending institutional support are meant to represent.
 The tennis-like tournaments in real-life where social capital does have
 a role to play are those where interactions are personal and small-scale
 e.g.
 interviews, formal introductions or business interactions.
 It has been argued more generally that the characteristics of status games
 are often made to reward curated abilities rather than naturally occurring
 raw-strengths

 Given the specific context of new environments of higher economic growth
 and introduction of education as an engine of mobility in the developing
 economies, we focus on consumer behaviour where the participants in a status
 competition expend without an

\end_inset

 knowledge of their individual raw-talent or social capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the weight 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 of raw-talent in the maximum total score considered for the win, the consumer
 preferences for the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 ( where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is raw-talent and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are skills that are available with higher expenditure) are considered under
 the assumption that the population remains constant over time (there are
 the same number of rich and poor in total) and that the participants are
 not not aware of their 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 before participating in the competitions.
 The rich participants are thus replaced by either a rich or poor participant
 only through the tournament that selects highest combined score regardless
 of rich or poor background of the participant.
 Since all consumers can participate in every such tournament, it is possible
 for a rich participant to lose her rich-position and let another participant
 acquire her position.
 We also assume that the preferences for all poor participants are the same
 as are the preferences of all the rich participants.
 Having a rich or a poor status by itself only has an indirect effect (through
 higher expenditure or budget) on the chance to be promoted (or maintaining
 one's rich position) - a probability that otherwise depends on the individual
 ability 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 All rich participants and all poor participants having the same behaviour
 also means that the individual attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 - which are not known to the participant - are not used to decide upon
 the expenditure (effort) towards the status game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that with the rich and poor participants having disparate incomes
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

), the above setup evidently puts the poor participants at a disadvantage
 since they may not afford to pay the costs to enhance their skills (i.e.
 realise the true worth of their skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 due to high participation costs).
 However, since both raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (the latter enhanced by costly institutional support) are randomly distributed
 in the population, the competition may never rule out the chance for a
 poor participant to win.
 For the same reason, the returns from investments to enhance one's skills
 may also be diminishing since one cannot beat raw-talent and non-enhanced
 skills after a certain point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to highlight that above status competitions are not meant
 to be population-wide tournaments that involve all participants of a society.
 Much like a tennis match, the number of participants is meant to be small
 in such competitions.
 The small-scale competitions vary locally defined criteria that may have
 multiple stages.
 Simply put, such competitions are more like an in-person job-interview
 than a nationwide entrance-exam.
 All such competitions are meant to be independent and may vary only in
 the threshold participation cost and range of distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i},s_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the participants.
 As scope of the presented chapter is limited to the effect of income difference
s on consumption, we discuss only a single instance of a competition with
 known distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 among a relatively small number of participants who exercise their choice
 to spend on social capital without an

Notably, a few properties of the game follow where a wealth-optimising participa
nt with a maximum score wins by enhancing her skills (social capital) and
 using her raw-talent.
 First, only one player with the maximum score can win a particular tournament.
 Second, the rank of the participant (rich / poor status) is of no direct
 significance part of her utility from wealth.
 Lastly, the raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are of no significance to expenditure decisions - which vary solely on
 the basis of rich or poor status.
 A closed-form solution with a diminishing utility from wealth and a threshold
 level expenditure required for participants to spend in order to avail
 social capital suggests that the only two equilibria relevant for status
 consumption are one where rich as well as poor consumer participates in
 the status competitions and one where only the rich consumer engage in
 competitions.
 Further, the higher income differences seem to encourage both poor and
 rich participants to engage in status competitions while high participation
 costs discourage the participation from the poor participant.

We believe that the results from the model contribute to the literature
 in a few different ways.
 First, the framework with uncertainty in consumer choice proposed in the
 chapter may be better suited for incorporating choices that affect mobility
 (including social hierarchy) that in turn correspond to material gain from
 status competitions.
 Second, the model is more useful for understanding status-related investments
 such education or professional club memberships that contribute probabilistical
ly to consumer wealth.
 Third, it elucidates how higher income differences in some developing economies
 could contribute to rises in status investments such as education.
 Within the framework used in the current chapter, it can be argued that
 education expenditures are subject to a discouragement through high participati
on costs but an incentivisation through high income differences.

 A fundamental problem that the sociology literature has elaborated further
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is the failure in empirical studies to reconcile the difference between
 objective aspects of status (the observed reality of status differences)
 and its subjective aspects (the effect of status differences on individual
 behaviour).
 An evident issue with addressing only the objective aspect of status using
 a utilitarian model while leaving the subjective aspect exogenous is that
 status may never be explained in economic terms when an economy for status
 is ruled out.
 As the literature in sociology warns, the idea of social-closure (aggregate

A link between objective and subjective aspects of status may also be key
 to addressing the debates in economics on whether inequality has a negative

 in a higher focus on status goods

 follows an approach suggested by 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to consider status only of an indirect role in maximisation of consumer
 utility from wealth.
 While the literature has used both preference interdepdence and constraint
 interdependence approaches for modeling of status 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 argue the two to be equivalent - since a utility function with status directly
 as an argument could also be seen as a reduced form of instrumental treatment
 of relative position.
 The indirect role of status in utlity maximising is modeled as a matching-proce
ss by 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 - where the participants have a concern for relative standing because of
 their standing being instrumental in determining ultimate consumption levels
 rather than being directly contributing to their utility.

The above probability function approach bears some similarity with the Tullock
 function used in contest theory approaches as well

 have also explored contexts similar to the model proposed in the current
 chapter.
 However, the approach used in the current chapter remains much simpler
 than that of a multi-stage Tullock contest under budget-constraints.
 Unlike the setting for two-stage contests explored in the contest theory
 literature - where the first-stage is used to limit the number of players
 participating in the second-stage 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BayeKavenockdeVries1993LobbyingTwoPlayer,AmegashieDesignofRentSeekingCompetitions1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - the game presented in the current chapter only uses second-stage to represent
 the last time-horizon (i.e.
 end of lifetime) of the participant rather than as a stage to eliminate
 players.
 The distribution of budget across the two-stages of the game is also of
 little concern in the setting explored in the current chapter since it's
 only the first-stage of the game when the expenditure can be less than
 the total budget.
 More particularly, the expenditure in the second-stage simply amounts to
 the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 for the poor participant and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 for the rich participant.
 It's only in the first-stage, strictly speaking, therefore that the consumption
 decisions are made by either participant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the view of status as an economic goal that corresponds to a
 possible future monetary benefit to the consumer - rather than a non-monetary
 utility - is unlike the view of status signaling used in many studies on
 conspicuous consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility,ireland_signals,OmoriSmithVisRace,CharlesHurstRace,KausSA,ZahraIndia,FrieheGermany,JaikumarConspConIneq,KnellInequalityStatusGrowth1999,falkchoosingjonesses2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is primarily because the utility from status consumption in the empirical
 studies on conspicuous consumption is treated both necessarily futile and
 entirely separable from a private (non-visible) utility.
 Our specific consideration of status - an approach that equates the social
 goals of the consumer with her long-term economic goals - bears more similarity
 with the approach followed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992,CorneoStatusGrowth2001,HalterInequalityGrowthTime2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 instead.
 Unlike the utility from consumption in excess of a certain reference level
 of consumer needs, the current approach views status consumption as investments
 towards material gains that are selected to maximise the utility assets
 accumulated under a scheme of uncertain promotions.

In the status game that selects the winner to be maintained at the rich
 position, only two characteristics matter for every individual.
 The first is the social capital that can be enhanced with expenditure by
 the individual participant and the second is a raw-talent that cannot be
 changed with higher expenditure.
 Both skill 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (enhanced with expenditure) and the raw talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (which cannot be changed with higher expenditure) are assumed to be uniformly
 distributed in the population.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 uniformly distributed, we can formulate the likelihood of any participant
 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,N]$
\end_inset

 as the probability for their total score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 being higher than any other participant - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 is a parameter that combines social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 so that the participant with maximum score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r+(1-\mu)s$
\end_inset

 wins the competition.
 The winner of the competition acquires a rich position so that she obtains
 the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 while the loser acquires the poor position receive 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start with a simpler case, consider that in a competition with raw-talents
 alone, the winning participant is one who has the maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 drawn from the sample 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the winner in a competition of raw-talents is a player
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{r_{i}<r_{j}\forall i\in[1,N]\}$
\end_inset

 and the probability that a given participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of raw-skill 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the winner is essentially that of all other players 
\begin_inset Formula $j\ne i$
\end_inset

 having ability 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{j\ne i}$
\end_inset

 less than 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the probability 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{1}{P(r_{i}>r_{1})\times P(r_{i}>r_{2})\times...P(r_{i}>r_{i-1})\times P(r_{i}>r_{i+1})...P(r>r_{N})}dr_{i}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a uniform distribution of skills 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $P(r_{i}\ge r)=r_{i}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,N]$
\end_inset

 and therefore, the probability is evaluates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}{(r_{i})^{N-1}}dr_{i}=\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

.
 With more players, the chances of a particular participant winning evidently
 declines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Introducing the skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 which are curated in social institutions, we consider a threshold investment
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 which is necessary to be spent for the social capital to be available to
 a participant.
 While this is an arrangement that evidently favours the rich participant,
 there are also diminishing returns to investing 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 towards the richer position if naturally occurring raw talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is also significant in the competition.
 To direct our focus on conditions when social capital is more important
 than raw-talent, we assume in the foregoing analysis that raw-talent is
 less valued than skills cultivated by institutions.
 As a result, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\mu>\mu$
\end_inset

 (which is equivalent to the following assumption) has been used throughout
 in the rest of the discussion.

 different probabilities to win depending on whether they spend

 More specifically, the participant takes advantage of the skills with weight
 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\mu$

 only when she spends an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$

 In the all-or-nothing payment scheme, the participant might avoid the investmen

\begin_layout Standard
In the game where a participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 with the maximum score 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the winner, the number of rich positions is fixed to 
\begin_inset Formula $N-P$
\end_inset

 so that only the top-scorer gets to occupy the only rich position available
 to be filled in every competition.
 The expected behaviour of the rich and the poor participants in the long-term
 can be explained with four different cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case I - The poor participant does not participate due to insufficient investmen
t 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 while the rich participant does participate by spending 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case II - The rich participant does not participate with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 but the poor participant does participate i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case III - Both poor and rich participants do not participate so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=0$

\begin_layout Standard
With Case I, the poor participant can win when her raw-talent (weighted
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

) is higher than the total score of all other poor participants as well
 as the total score of the rich participants (who compete with acquired
 skills).
 The poor are priced out of accessing any skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in their score in Case I so that only the rich participants with investment
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 have skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s>0$
\end_inset

 Thus, a given poor participant must be ahead both of all of the poor participan
ts and the rich participants so that a participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 may win only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is higher than than raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{k}$

 in all poor participants and also exceeds the score

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P_{1}(\text{win}|r_{i}) & =\begin{cases}
\frac{\mu^{N-P}r_{i}^{2N-P-1}}{2\mu(1-\mu)} & 0<r_{i}<\mu\\
r_{i}^{P-1}(\frac{\mu r_{i}-\mu/2}{1-\mu})^{N-P} & \mu<r_{i}<1-\mu\\
r_{i}^{P-1}(1-\frac{(\mu r_{i}-1)^{2}}{2\mu(1-\mu)})^{N-P} & 1-\mu<r_{i}<1\\

With the uniform density for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(r_{i})=1$
\end_inset

 ), total probability to win can be calculated as
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the participants do not know the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 before they participate in such competitions, the total probability can
 be evaluated with the assumption that both 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 range from 0 to 1.
 Notice also that since only one participant can win the skills-game, the
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}P_{2}(\text{win}|r_{i},s_{i})ds_{i}dr_{i}$
\end_inset

 for a rich participant to win is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{N-P}-\frac{P}{N-P}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}P_{1}(\text{win}|r_{i},s_{i})ds_{i}dr_{i}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case II, when the rich person has no access to social capital (i.e.
 all rich participants have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

), the poor participant has the skills-advantage in the game so the probability
 to win for the poor participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
P(\text{win}|r_{i},s_{i})=\prod_{k=1,k\ne i}^{P}P(\mu r_{k}+(1-\mu)s_{k}<\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i})\prod_{k=P+1}^{N}P(\mu r_{k}<\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i})\\

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case III, when neither the rich nor the poor participate in the game,
 then the game depends only on raw-talents and all participants have the
 same probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

 to win the game.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{N}}{N}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\text{win}|r_{i})=\prod_{k=1,k\ne i}^{P}P(r_{k}<r_{i})\prod_{k=P+1}^{N}P(r_{k}<r_{i})=r_{i}{}^{N-1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case IV, when both rich and poor participants set 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$

\begin_layout Standard
Using symmetry arguments, this winning probability - which is the same for
 all participants - also turns out to be 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$

 for all the participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the effect of expenditure on the winning probabilit
y is weakened with higher number of participants in the game where abilities
 (both skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 relevant for social capital and the raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

) are uniformly distributed.
 In other words, if poor and rich participants were to be considered as
 two separate groups, then the effect of expenditure on their wins declines
 when more and more participants are sampled with varied raw-talents and
 skills.

\end_inset

 can win with the following probability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P(\text{win}|r_{1}) & =P(\mu r_{2}+(1-\mu)s_{2}<\mu r_{1})=F_{X}(\mu r_{1})
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{1}<\mu<1-\mu<1$
\end_inset

 is implied due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 ).
 The probability that the total score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{2}+(1-\mu)s_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{1}$
\end_inset

 implies that only the first part of the piece-wise function for 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{X}(x)$
\end_inset

 needs to be considered.
 Therefore, using 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\text{win}|r_{1})=\frac{\mu^{2}r_{1}^{2}}{2\mu(1-\mu)}$
\end_inset

, we evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}(\text{win})$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P_{1}(\text{win})=\int_{0}^{1}P(\text{win}|r_{1})dr_{1} & =\frac{\mu}{6(1-\mu)}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case II, the rich person does not participate (

 A poor participant wins by having the total score higher than the raw-talent
 of the rich participant (who does not acquire skills with investment).
 Representing 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\equiv\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula $1$

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\mu}$
\end_inset

 in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,\mu)$
\end_inset

 (this is because 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 ).
 In other words, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using double-integral properties (see Appendix VII), the total probability
 to win 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}(\text{win})$
\end_inset

 for a poor participant is evaluated as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
P_{1}(\text{win})=\int_{s_{1}=0}^{s_{1}=1}\int_{r_{1}=0}^{r_{1}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{1},s_{1})ds_{1}dr_{1}=\int_{r_{1}=0}^{r_{1}=1}{\int_{s_{1}=0}^{s_{1}=\frac{\mu(1-r_{1})}{1-\mu}}\ \frac{(\mu r_{1}+(1-\mu)s_{1})}{\mu}ds_{1}dr_{1}}\\
+\int_{r_{1}=0}^{r_{1}=1}{\int_{s_{1}=\frac{\mu(1-r_{1})}{1-\mu}}^{s_{1}=1-\frac{\mu r_{1}}{1-\mu}}1\ ds_{1}dr_{1}}\\
+\int_{r_{1}=0}^{r_{1}=1}{\int_{s_{1}=1-\frac{\mu r_{1}}{1-\mu}}^{s_{1}=1}1\ ds_{1}dr_{1}}\\
=\frac{\mu}{3(1-\mu)}+\frac{1-2\mu}{1-\mu}+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu)}\\
=\frac{2\mu}{6(1-\mu)}+\frac{6(1-2\mu)}{6(1-\mu)}+\frac{3\mu}{6(1-\mu)}=\frac{6-7\mu}{6(1-\mu)}
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

The probability

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Case III 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case III, when neither the rich nor the poor participate in the game,
 then the game depends only on raw-talents and both participants have the
 same probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 to win the game.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{2}}{2}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 Both the poor and rich participant have the same total probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Case IV
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case IV, when both rich and poor participants set 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, then the poor participant can win only if her score 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is above that of the rich participant.
 Therefore, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
P(\text{win}|r_{1},s_{1})=P(\mu r_{2}+(1-\mu)s_{2}<\mu r_{1}+(1-\mu)s_{1})\\

\frac{x_{1}-\mu/2}{1-\mu} & \mu<x_{1}<1-\mu\\
1-\frac{(x_{1}-1)^{2}}{2\mu(1-\mu)} & 1-\mu<x_{1}<1\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this integral can be evaluated based on symmetry arguments ( since
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is also randomly distributed), the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{s_{1}=0}^{s_{1}=1}\int_{r_{1}=0}^{r_{1}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{1},s_{1})dr_{1}ds_{1}$
\end_inset

 also evaluates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

), the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<1/2$
\end_inset

 - indicating that curated skills are given more importance that raw-talent
 in the competitions - means that the poor participant is strictly better
 off (than facing probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

) if she participates while the rich participant doesn't participate (Case
 II).
 Also, the poor participant is better off participating for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 when the rich participant does participate as it raises the probability
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

.
 That the competition becomes uncompetitive both when threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 falls too much (letting both participants participate) or rises too much
 (letting both both participants withdraw) also follows from the properties
 of the winning probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the rich participant could withdraw and face either 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 or lower probability (when the poor participant participates).
 By participating, therefore, the rich participant would either face probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 (when poor participant also participates) or better (if the poor participant
 withdraws).
 Considering the probabilities alone, the rich participant would always
 participate.
 If the rich participant always participates, then so long as budget constraints
 permit, the poor participant is also better off participating since not
 participating brings her probability to win below 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

.
 If the utility was from probability alone, then both participants would
 participate and face 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it's not the probability to win that the participants are likely
 to optimise (maximise).
 The participants are more likely to face a finite life-time and utility
 from accumulated assets instead.
 We therefore explore the case where the participants optimise an intertemporall
y additive utility over their life-time.
 The life-time in the model is represented with two time-horizons - where
 the second-time horizon is one before the end of life when all wealth accumulat
ed by either participant must disappear.
 With no accumulations at the end of life, both rich and poor participants
 must decide to spend all their incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 (for poor and rich participants respectively so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

) towards the promotion game.
 In the first-stage, however, the participants decide the amount to be spent
 towards promotion based upon the utility from wealth they obtain across
 the two time-horizons that span their lifetime.
 For the poor participant, the total utility to be optimised (assuming EUT)
 under the intertemporally additive utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\cdot)$
\end_inset

, a winning probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $W(x)$
\end_inset

 (for expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

) and a discount-factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(y_{1}-\nu_{1})+\frac{1}{\delta}((1-W(y_{1}))u(y_{1})+W(y_{1})u(y_{2}))
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, for the rich participant, the total utility to be optimised (assuming
 EUT) is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(y_{2}-\nu_{2})+\frac{1}{\delta}((1-W(y_{2}))u(y_{1})+W(y_{2})u(y_{2}))

 We then proceed to discuss the implications for the effect of income difference
s on expenditure towards status.
 It is worth remarking that our discussion of the effect of the threshold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and the income differences 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on participation (expenditure) assumes that the exogenous parameter

 is stable with respect to short-term changes in threshold investment

 the poor participant is able to spend 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}<y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 When the poor participant faces a binding constraint i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

 , then the rich participant knows that the best case probability to win
 for the poor participant is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$

 The rich participant's decision to participate would depend only on utility
 from savings and the relative advantage from gain in probability.

Since the number of poor participants is likely to be higher than that of
 rich participants in a typical competition, the unequal number of poor
 and rich participants seems also worth considering in the model.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3,P=2$
\end_inset

 in the equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CaseIV_general"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, for example, we can interpret the 
\series bold
three-player
\series default
 model with the following values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2},p_{1}'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}'$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
p_{1}=\frac{\mu}{8(1-\mu)}\nonumber \\
p_{2}=1-2p_{1}\nonumber \\
p_{1}'=\frac{19\mu^{2}-40\mu+20}{40(1-\mu)^{2}}\label{eq:probabilities_3player}\\

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

), we see that the probability to win for the poor participant in the 3-player
 model is lower with respect to the Case III probability (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

).
 Likewise, the probability for the rich participant to win is higher in
 the 3-player model with respect to the Case III probability (

Assuming EUT participants we first consider the simpler case of binding
 constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we assume a stability in long-term participant behaviour (which itself
 is a result of observed probability of success), mixed-strategies are not
 relevant in the current set up.
 Considering pure strategies for participation, the rich participant would
 thus participate only when the utility from participating would be higher
 than from not participating i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})+\frac{p_{2}u(y_{2})+(1-p_{2})u(y_{1})}{\delta}>u(y_{2})+\frac{u(y_{2})+u(y_{1})}{2\delta}$
\end_inset

 .
 This results in the following condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{(p_{2}-1/2)(u(y_{2})-u(y_{1}))}{\delta} & >u(y_{2})-u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With income differences being the same an increase in participation cost
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 discourages participation since RHS increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\because u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})$
\end_inset

 is decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

) and may fail the above condition.
 Similarly, with participation cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 being the same, an increase in income-difference 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is in the rich participant's interest whereas a narrowing of income differences
 reduces incentive for the participant to participate by possibly failing
 the above condition.
 All else being the same, higher impatience (lower time-discounted value
 of money or a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

) would also discourage participation.
 Therefore, when budget is binding for the poor participant i.e.
 if the poor participant cannot participate due to 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, then narrower income differences, higher participation costs and higher
 patience for savings (common for both rich and poor participants) all encourage

 This also means that wider income differences (

\end_inset

) combined with lower participation costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

) may together help maintain the equilibrium where only the rich participates.
 Similarly, wider income differences ( higher

\end_inset

 An increase in

 Likewise, a decrease in

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U_{1}}{u(y_{2})-u(y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 by raising the stakes enough for the poor to participate (making it less
 likely for first inequality to be fulfilled).
 It is easy to see that higher impatience 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 encourages both poor and rich to withdraw.
 As we shall see, equilibrium conditions corresponding to Case II are far
 more stringent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Case II is a Nash Equilibrium, then for rich's decision to withdraw,
 the poor participant should get more utility from participating than from
 withdrawing and for poor participant's decision to participate, the rich

 This means that the following hold

\end_inset

 , the above cannot be satisfied so long as we have a diminishing utility
 which necessitates 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{2}<U_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus an equilibrium with Case II which incentivises the poor to participate
 but not the rich is possible only with a reference dependent utility with
 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}<U_{2}$
\end_inset

 With 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}<U_{2}$

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that despite a reference-dependent utility, a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 or more impatience (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 to Case III).
 Similarly, higher income differences (an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

) could encourage the rich to participate by decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U_{2}}{u(y_{2})-u(y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 (leading to Case IV).
 Even with the reference dependent utility, the equilibrium with Case II
 remains a fragile one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Case III were to be a Nash-Equilibrium, then for rich participant's decision

 Conversely, if the game is not lucrative for the rich it would automatically
 be infeasible for the poor i.e.
 if rich withdraws then poor automatically withdraws.
 If there is any net utility from playing the game, however, Case IV is

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{2}<U_{1}$

 , this equilibrium rests upon the incentive for the poor participant to
 participate.
 So long as the poorer participant finds the competition worthwhile, the
 rich would also participate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results outline how participation costs influence the investments
 towards status.
 For very low 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$

\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, both would withdraw.
 For everything in between, the only equilibrium with a diminishing utility
 from wealth is one where rich participate whereas poor don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above framework also allows us to discuss the implications of inequality
 for the same total wealth in the economy.
 As such, a segregation where the poor never participate in the status economy
 seems less favourable than one where both rich and poor participate in
 the status competitions.
 The current chapter explains that the likely outcome of a failure to maintain
 universal participation in status games (under diminishing utility from
 wealth) is that of a segregation where only the rich participate in skills
 leading to economic success.
 While a reference-based utility (which may be encouraged with segregation)
 does seem to permit an equilibrium where only the poor are concerned with
 status games (with respect to skills-enhancement), the result only suggests
 that a segregation of status games along with that of incomes is another
 possible long-term outcome of limited participation.

\begin_layout Standard
We have considered a model where status amounts to a position that only
 temporarily cements the participant's economic position.
 With a decision theory framework for uncertainty, the goal of the model
 has been to investigate role of income difference on expenditures that
 carry some status while also having some effect on the income mobility
 of the participants.
 The endogenisation of status in this manner allows us to use the framework
 to understand the role of income difference in aspirational consumption
 under urbanisation effects across economies that have varied status-determining
 cultural notions as well as development indicators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foremost result from the model is that under diminishing utility from
 wealth, the only two stable equilibria are those where both rich and poor
 participate in status competitions and those where only rich stand to benefit
 from status competitions.
 The model allows us to understand how a withdrawal from expenditure such
 as education in certain developing economies could be result of a combined
 effect of both participation costs and income-differences.
 More specifically, high participation costs push the equilibrium to one
 where where only rich participate in status-related competitions whereas
 high income differences may have the unlikely effect of incentivising the
 poor consumers to participate.
 In the context of developing economies, lowering of participation costs
 in education (as a status game) despite rise in income differences may
 thus also represent a likely escape from segregation of participation in
 the near-term for many developing economies.
 The role of a reference-based utility adds an important caveat to these
 results since contentment at lower levels of wealth could support segregation
 of competitions at different income levels in the economy.

\begin_layout Abstract
While consumption of basic needs may have hardly any status value in societies
 where basic consumption needs have been fulfilled, food continues to carry
 some status value in societies undergoing economic transitions where it
 is either scarce or expensive.
 The presented chapter explores the role of permanent income in demand substitut
ion for food quality in Tanzania where food continues to carry a status
 significance.
 Comparing effects of permanent income and that of prices of food commodities,
 we find a higher price-based quality associated with meats and fruits to
 be aligned with the income disparities as well as with the availability
 of electricity in Tanzania - suggesting that the access to urban amenities
 also significantly influences consumption of higher quality food items
 in the economy.

% [barnett2005shoppingguccicanalst] - says emulation of snob is key.
 All else being the same, something that claims to emulate snobs would have
 more value.
 But why? Not merely because such a snob value is preferred by the consumers.
 If consumer go and act based on such values e.g., by entering subways and
 shops where they're likely to get noticed more easily or are preferred
 in interactions.
 There is some belief that being happier would make you more successful.
 It would because subjective wellbeing is not merely subjective it does
 seem to make you work harder and engage more with the economy (Why would
 you not engage more with the economy, if you feel that it's helping you
 become more like snobs).
 Barnett says that

 with a well-established brand by introducing a number of brand extensions
 and sub-product lines with lower quality than the original brand, by licensing
 logos and too widely, by failing to closely regulate retailers product
 displays and other sales practices, or simply by overproducing,so that
 firm's brand image became tarnished and sales ultimately fell.

 In the context of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the current chapter examines
 what demand for higher quality may imply for trends in aspirational consumption.
 Using food as the basic need for this examination, the chapter asks two
 particular questions that may help evaluate the expected rise of high quality
 for basic needs in SSA

 First, it asks whether certain high-quality items stand out in food consumption
 in a typical economy of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) or not.
 Second, it asks whether permanent income in urban as well as non-urban
 areas significantly limits higher quality consumption for such items of
 high quality.
 If the effects of permanent income on higher quality are strong, then an
 overall rise in quality may largely depend on how newer food items are
 introduced in urban and rural markets.
 The chapter argues in favour of the conventional argument that a higher
 quality being limited to richer sections of society puts evident limits
 on the rise in consumption of such items

 To explore permanent income effects on high price-based quality, the chapter
 employs a conventional quantity-based framework - while using a dietary
 diversity standard to test whether certain items of higher quality stand
 out in the survey of quality or not.
 It also tests whether the quality consumed may be higher in more urbanised
 regions or not.

The analysis of food as an unlikely category of aspirational consumption
 in the current chapter is motivated by two observations.
 First, there seem compelling results from sociological surveys for status
 associated with food in certain economies of SSA where a transformation
 from agrarian to industrial societies is under way

 A survey of variation in quality is of significance for studying sub-Saharan
 African economies for other reasons as well.
 The strong preferences that we observe in the current chapter towards certain
 items - preferences which raise the overall food quality - are of interest
 from the perspective of food policy due to the prevalent link between SES
 and poor dietary diversity (DD) in the region

 , the recent experience of higher consumption in Tanzania leaves wide dispariti
es in asset ownership and urbanisation levels - a disparity that allows
 us to understand the role that variation in urban developments may play
 towards consumption of basic needs.
 The ongoing urbanisation also leaves a significant presence of semi-urban
 areas in Tanzania due in part to an incomplete transition away from subsistence
 farming in the economy

A fundamental contention that we maintain for implications of permanent
 income effects on food demand and rise in consumption is that higher quality
 in any given food category may not be an instance of excessive consumption.
 This is foremost because the notion of food-related basic needs spans more
 than the minimal calorific intake required for survival

- allowing for consumption of quality at the cost of its quantity for any
 particular food category to comprise of basic necessities.
 Further, even if consumers are compelled to increase quality in certain
 food categories rather than others (for reasons unobserved), one needs
 a specific normative criteria to argue that quality substitution of a particula
r food category with another is actually excessive.
 Instead of determining whether the quality consumed is excessive or not,
 our focus in the chapter remains on assessing whether consumption of higher
 quality is narrowed down to specific food categories relevant for food
 diversity or not and on explaining what that may imply for consumption
 trends.
 While we do use the FAO-specified nutrition categories

 to help assess the extent to which higher quality in specific categories
 may be aligned with recommended food diversity, the FAO-categories are
 used only to provide a qualitative view of variation in quality while avoiding
 any particular judgment on what is considered necessary for the consumer.
 The empirical goal of the chapter is thus limited to testing whether higher
 permanent income results in a higher demand for quality across FAO-provided
 food categories in Tanzania or not.
 The chapter discusses the implications for aspirational consumption of
 factors other than permanent income - such as the role of availability
 of basic amenities and urbanisation.
 It argues that while high quality consumption may rise in future, a segregation
 of food demand based on high or low permanent income may depend on how
 newer food items are introduced in the market.

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of variation in food quality relies on a robust framework for
 quality in demand - where a measure for quality across commodities (such
 as fruits, fat, meats-proteins etc.) upholds the theoretical restrictions
 imposed by aggregation of demand across various goods (such as coconut,
 mango etc.
 that may be classified within a commodity:fruits) that are part of a commodity
 group (such as fruits).
 More specifically, the method follows the restrictions implied due to the
 Hick's commodity theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hicksvaluecapital1946,DeatonEconConsumer,NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which requires the physical quantities of goods consumed to be weighted
 by unchanging (relative) prices of the constituent goods before the quantities
 can be aggregated into the demand for group whose quality is measured.
 Thus, the quality of fruits as commodity - for example - can be evaluated
 only as long as the goods - coconut, mango etc.
 that may constitute the fruits commodity - exhibit a stable relative price-stru
cture.
 To avoid confusion in the terminology associated goods and quality, we
 use the nomenclature provided by

The particular theoretical approach is important for our analysis of demand
 for quality due to two reasons.
 First, the approach is preferable over an arbitrary aggregation of quality
 from groups that does not follow the aggregation restrictions in a demand
 equation.
 Such restrictions may limit our ability to talk about substitution in quality
 across commodity groups - 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

which is the core part of our assessment of how quality availed of certain
 food categories may be higher than others

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Second, a robust aggregation based on market-prices also helps circumvent
 measurement issues arising out of use of unit-prices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary criterion of grouping the demand from goods consumed into a
 commodity group using the approach is a stable relative price-structure
 of market prices that are available in the consumption survey

The prices observed in local markets are those in the district where the
 household - whose consumption is recorded for budget shares and quality

\end_layout

 A classification of food items into commodities for which quality metrics
 are calculated is thus undertaken using past observed-market prices of
 all goods available in the survey alone - where a quality metric is associated
 with each food commodity such that the constituent goods of every commodity
 (which quality is calculated for) move together in terms of their annual
 prices

This is a departure from the unit-value approaches where average expenditure
 itself is considered as a price-control.
 It needs to be emphasised also that the groups of food-commodities over
 which quality is evaluated are determined based on a similar change in
 prices (rather than the prices themselves i.e.
 the classification does not place all high-price items in one group and
 low-price groups in another).
 
\begin_inset ERT

 The condition of a stable relative prices structure (due to Hicks Commodity
 Theorem) drives a clustering of relative price changes across all goods
 for food in the survey that we describe in

 The FAO categories are then used as the nutritional basis upon which we
 assess how the food demand may have higher quality in certain commodity
 groups vs others.
 Thus, the commodity groups obtained from the clustering are further divided
 based on the twelve FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
 Nations) categories - (i) cereals, (ii) vegetables, (iii) fruits, (iv)
 meat, (v) eggs (vi) fish and other sea foods (vii) legumes, nuts and seeds,
 (viii) milk and milk products (ix) oil and fats, (x) sweets (xi) spices,
 condiments and beverages and (xii) tubers and roots

 The direct use of market-observed prices also has the advantage that it
 avoids using unit-values (price-deflator) as price controls in our analysis.
 More specifically, the market-prices - used as controls in the analyses
 - avoid the measurement errors that arise with the use of unit-values (which
 approximate the price of an item with the average of item expenditure divided
 by its quantity consumed).

 commodity-groups.

Other than using the stable relative price-structure associated with a commodity
 (fat, cereals etc.), the quality metric for every household depends on the
 measurement of quantities of high vs low-price variants (goods) consumed
 within a food commodity (e.g., the quantities consumed of wheat, rice, maize
 for quality in cereals commodity).
 Considering a commodity-group of cereals comprising of rice, maize and
 wheat, for example, maize would contribute to lower quality of cereals-commodit
y than wheat and rice if the prices (per-kg) of wheat and rice are higher
 than that of maize.
 Other than the quality metric thus calculated for every food commodity
 (such as cereals), the budget shares per household for each of these commoditie
s are used as dependent variables in the system of equations used for an
 AIDS estimation.

The results indicate that higher permanent income (measured as total expenditure
) is associated with higher demand for meat-related proteins and fruits
 in particular.
 Further, the effect is made stronger due to regional inequalities relating
 to variations in urbanisation levels in Tanzania.
 More specifically, electricity being sparsely available in the urban areas
 of Tanzania suggests strong effects of both electricity availability and
 urbanisation levels on price-based quality (meats and fruits in particular)

 Third, it provides and employs a feasible method to include food prices

The study variation of food quality has had a long tradition in empirical
 economics
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

 One of the earliest approaches for measurement of quality had been to treat
 it as a separate good 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerQuality1952"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 - thus decomposing the quality price elasticity of demand (quantity purchased)
 into a quantity price elasticity of expenditure on quality and an income
 elasticity of quality measure.
 The treatment of quality as a separate good has been widely used ever since
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{DeatonEconConsumer}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A common example of the approach is a simple repackaging method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 - which interprets demand for a high-quality good as multiples of lower
 quality goods.
 More specifically, the demand for goods with a certain price using the
 repackaging approach is viewed in terms of a base-price and a quality parameter
 - the implicit assumption being that the variants in every category are
 perfect substitutes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most empirical studies, however, the perfect substitution turns out
 to be a stringent requirement since the variation in quality among goods
 within a commodity may be often extreme.
 As an example, even though quality consumed of electricity under energy
 commodity may be higher than that of kerosene, the substitution between
 electricity and kerosene may in fact be little - thus making it difficult
 to justify a view of a demand for electricity in terms of the units of
 kerosene consumed
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While one may address this issue with use of an energy-budget (calories),
 the unavailability of quantities consumed or prices in the consumption
 data limit wider applications of such an approach.

 Nevertheless, simple-repackaging does turn out to be appropriate in the
 context of cost-of-living index problems where a substitution is implied

\begin_layout Standard
Some constraints on either consumer preferences or prices are needed - when
 perfect substitution isn't possible - so as to measure the quality using
 both quantities consumed and prices of goods within a commodity.
 As such, the problem of measuring quality of a commodity comprising of
 multiple goods is that of assigning a quality metric to the entire commodity
 group using the a combination of quantities consumed of the goods within
 the commodity group at prices known for every good.
 As 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{NelsonQualityQuantity}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 explains, the approach to measurement of food quality in such a manner
 must either assume weakly separable preferences with homothetic within-group
 preferences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CoxWohlgenant1986,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or a stable price-structure in a commodity group with a base-price associated
 with the commodity.
 The current chapter opts for the latter approach since it not only imposes
 fewer restrictions on the consumer preferences but also makes use of the
 market prices rather than the unit-prices
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The unit-prices are the total expenditure divided by quantities consumed
 that are used prices as controls in a regression with budget, quantity
 or quality as dependent variables.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is worth emphasising that the homotheticity of within-group preferences
 presents
\series bold
 
\series default
an implausible constraint on the demand - since it implies either that the
 within-group income expansion path would be a straight line through the
 origin or that the group composition would remain independent of income
 - conditions.
 Such a restriction on preferences would mean - for example - that the ratio
 of electricity consumed to the kerosene consumed must be the same for both
 rich and poor consumers - a constraint that is unlikely to hold empirically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More formally, consider that in a generic sense, a quality-metric associated
 with a certain commodity (e.g., cereals, fat etc.) depends on a grouping of
 items - which the commodity comprises of - subject to certain homogeneity
 restrictions.
 Given the quantity consumed

 The Hick's commodity theorem-based approach - which imposes a restriction

 the current chapter does not impose the stringent homotheticity assumption
 on preferences.

Simply put, the approach we adopt in the current chapter prevents considering
 chicken and eggs into one commodity unless the relative price structure
 for the two items (chicken and eggs) does not change.
 No other criteria - arbitrary or otherwise - is followed to group the goods
 into commodities.
 Subject to the restriction, the notion of quality is set to a price-weighted
 quantity (made possible due the availability of market prices) so that
 given the same expenditure, a lower quantity of the composite good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the composite good 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 The commodity groups thus selected are obtained by clustering goods into
 commodity groups based on similar price-changes over the years 2008, 2010,
 2012 and 2014.
 A further step sub-divides the clusters thus obtained based on the FAO

The issue of unavailability of market prices - often sidelined in many empirical
 studies - has recently gathered some attention (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 As such the measurement of quality is often performed without available
 market prices - by simply averaging over the expenditures (recorded costs)
 of a particular item in a given region (or over the entire population of
 households).
 This so-called unit-value (or price-deflator) method uses the average expenditu
re divided by quantity consumer for all the consumers as prices in the empirical
 analyses (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for a recent implementation).
 While using unit-values as prices may be appropriate for certain empirical
 concerns, the measurement errors introduced by their can be severe and
 difficult to ignore for finer conclusions relating to price and income
 elasticities.
 More specifically, the quantity consumed appearing both in the dependent
 variable (as budget share's numerator) and in the control variable (as
 the denominator for unit-value used as price) cannot be always mitigated

Compared with the measurement of elasticities for every individual good,
 the advantage with the aggregation over commodity groups is that the latter
 does not present the issue of non-consumption of high-quality goods.
 More specifically, if one were to calculate the price elasticities for
 individual goods, an obvious issue that arises is that certain items (particula
rly those with high-quality) might not be consumed at all for a significant
 part of the population.
 
\begin_inset ERT

 address this issue by correcting for non-consumption using the inverse

 The Heien-Wells (HW) approach effectively treats the consumption on high

 also use the unit-values instead of (unavailable) market prices.
 Further, the unit-values obtained from the households using a good are
 used as prices for those who don't consume the good.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While HW approach may be well-suited for comparison of elasticities for
 specific goods (see Appendix II for empirical results using the approach),
 the comparison of quality across multiple commodities is a more appropriate
 interpretation for the overview of quality we seek in the current chapter.
 Since it is much less likely for no goods to be consumed within a broader
 commodity group (fruits-veg, protein etc.) over which the quality measure
 is calculated, the approach with quality aggregated over broader commodity
 groups also circumvents the issue of non-consumption.
 No correction related to non-consumption - as used in HW method - is therefore
 used with our approach that aggregates quality over groups classified with
 homogeneity restrictions (see Section

The variation in quality across multiple food sub-categories is examined
 using the estimated income elasticities for quality using total household
 expenditure as the main explanatory variable and urban-amenities as key
 controls.
 The empirical analysis we pursue in the chapter thus addresses the concerns
 related with SES effects on food diversity that have been remarked by many
 empirical studies

 as consumption of protein, fats and vitamins relative to starchy items.

 A control for amenities such as electricity are also used - other than
 total expenditure as our main explanatory variable - in the current chapter
 to examine the variation in food quality across Tanzania.
 In its particular context, rapid urbanisation seems to have brought challenges
 to food security for the lower-income households in the towns and cities
 within Tanzania - even though the country has managed to maintain a broad
 self-sufficiency in basic food items

 The agricultural policy has also focused on a transition from subsistence
 farming to more efficient large-scale rural farming since urban farming
 seems common in the country

 As such, a significant number of households dependent on self-farming in

 and rural food demand that may be apparent from the conventional models
 for urban-rural migration

The measure of quality used in the current chapter for each food commodity
 group (such as fat, cereals etc.) comprising of multiple items (maize, rice,
 wheat etc.
 for cereals etc.) relies on higher weights to high-priced items (rice given
 higher weight than maize based solely on price etc.) within each commodity
 group.
 The commodity groups over which the quality is calculated are based on
 the price-structure restrictions implied by the Hicks Commodity Theorem
 ( more details to follow in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ClassificationGoods"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 A further sub-classification - which does not disrupt the commodities identifie
d based on similarity of price structure - is used to assist interpretation
 from a DD perspective and is guided by FAO categories recommended for food
 diversity.
 It is worth highlighting that instead of measuring an overall food quality
 across all of the food items consumed, we inspect quality only for different
 commodity groups whose constituents satisfy the Hick's commodity theorem.
 The quality across food can thus be seen as a vector associated with the
 set of food commodities.
 As we detail in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ClassificationGoods"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the quality vector

 is based on price-correlation requirement from the Hicks Commodity Theorem
 - while the groups based on movements are further subdivided based on FAO
 categories to assist interpretations from a DD perspective.

The main criterion of grouping of food items into commodity groups is the
 co-movement of prices.
 The prices - shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 - are taken from the wave corresponding to years 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014
 in the survey.
 An unsupervised k-means clustering is then used to group the items into
 commodities based on price changes - so that the items within every commodity
 group identified have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

similar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 relative price-changes.
 The groups based strictly on price-movements thus obtained are then split
 into further categories aligned with the FAO recommended categories i.e.
 (i) cereals, (ii) vegetables, (iii) fruits, (iv) meat, (v) eggs (vi) fish
 and other sea foods (vii) legumes, nuts and seeds, (viii) milk and milk
 products (ix) oil and fats, (x) sweets (xi) spices, condiments and beverages
 and (xii) tubers and roots.
 More specifically, the k-means clustering is performed on the relative
 price-changes from available prices.
 Considering beef as an example good, the prices for beef in the years 2008,
 2010, 2012, 2014 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{beef}=\{3500.0,4000.0,5000.0,6000.0\}$
\end_inset

 - which correspond to a relative price-change vector 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{beef}=\{\frac{4000}{3500},\frac{5000}{4000},\frac{6000}{5000}\}=\{1.14,1.25,1.2\}$
\end_inset

.
 The relative price-change vectors for all the items (beef, goat, fresh_milk
 etc.) thus obtained are clustered using the k-means method - where the number
 of selected clusters is guided by the within-cluster sum of squared errors
 - an approach commonly used in k-means applications 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pollard1982CLTKmeans"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The classification we use as the basis for commodity groups are arrived
 at by setting the number of clusters to 5 which is when the within-cluster
 sum of squared errors drops to less than unity
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A higher number of clusters does not significantly reduce the within-cluster

It is worth emphasising that the partition of commodity groups identified
 from the unsupervised k-means clustering into further sub-groups based
 on FAO categories does not pick goods from disparate clusters into a new
 sub-group.
 Instead, the further partition into sub-groups based on FAO categories
 is based on the observation that that the price-changes of goods within
 sub-groups formed by splitting a particular group identified by clustering
 would also be correlated with each other.
 The groups obtained by the classification based on correlation prices (shown
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceBasedGroups"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 More specifically, the commodity cereals-milk-greens is split into milk,
 veg and cereals, fruits-fish is split into fruits and fish, startches-fats-comp
lements is split into starches, fats and complements while the categories
 tubers and meatsproteins are retained.
 The resulting categories are therefore i) cereals ii) veg iii) fruits iv)
 meats-proteins v) fish vi) milk vii)fat viii) complements ix) tubers x)
 chicken and xi) starches whose constituents are shown in Table

As explained before, the basis for the quality metric associated for every

 (corresponding to the left side of the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 which states that a group of goods behave as if they were a single commodity
 so long as the prices of the group of goods changes in the same proportion.
 Simply put, a constant relative price structure allows us to factor out
 the quantity of the composite commodity consumed from the demand function
 for the variants (goods) within the commodity - allowing the price of quality
 to be interpreted in terms of a composite price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the commodity aggregate 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the price-structure

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 goods with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}=\{p_{i,G}\}_{i\in[1,n]}$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 as the total expenditure on group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, the constant relative price-structure permits us to write the commodity-aggreg

 The essential appeal of aggregation is the simplified view of demand across
 all items.
 Consider for example, if we were to represent demands for items {wheat,
 rice, yam,coconut, eggs, beef, chicken, fish, goat, honey}.
 As such these items would each correspond to a demand function so that
 10 functions describe the demand for all the 10 items.
 The aggregated view allows us to view demands for commodities {carb, protein
 and complements} - where the 10 goods are encompassed in just 3 respective
 functions for the 3 commodity groups.
 A key requirement for the validity of such a quality metric - however -
 is that the prices of goods within the commodity group have a constant
 relative price-structure i.e.
 a relative prices ratio that can be factored out of the observed prices
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"

 This condition - due to the Hicks commodity theorem - drives the k-means
 grouping of items described above.

 To explain with particular example goods, consider two pairs of items with
 similar price-movements - with sugar and tea being the first pair that
 have similar price changes (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceBasedGroups"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 Let the second pair be rice and cooking-oil - who also have price changes
 similar to each other (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceBasedGroups"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Notice however that not only do sugar and tea have similar price changes,
 they also have a similar functional sense implied by FAO categories.
 Therefore, they are classified in a group 
\shape italic
complements
\shape default
 in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 Rice and cooking-oil on the other hand are split into two categories based
 on the different functional sense implied by FAO-categories (see Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:GroupsModified"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

).
 Other categories such as meatsproteins, fruits etc.
 are similarly based foremost on price-movement correlations before considering
 the functional sense implied by FAO categories for interpretation from
 a DD perspective.

 Based on the local market-observed prices of the goods within the commodity
 group 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 (such as cereals, fat etc.), the quality metric for the household ensures
 that a household who buys more of the high-priced good within a commodity
 group is viewed as one consuming higher quality of the commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 This is why no quality is considered for chicken, the only good within
 its own commodity group.
 As we've explained in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ClassificationGoods"
plural "false"

To calculate the quality associated with a group 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 (such as the items : beet and goat in the commodity: meatsproteins) that
 have a constant within-group relative price-structure, a base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (meatsproteins) is selected as the minimum price of the items among the
 commodity aggregate constituents (e.g., among beef and goat).
 This is based on the approach suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 is then used to assign i) an aggregate-quantity of a composite good (for
 meatsproteins) comprising of quantities consumed of the items constituted
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (beef, goat) and ii) a quality metric corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 ( based on the proportion of goat and beef consumed).
 In other words, with the quantities consumed for beef and goat under meatsprote
ins commodity available to us, a quantity of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meatsproteins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is associated with the particular set of quantities consumed for beef and
 goat.
 The aggregate-quantity of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meatsproteins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is then calculated by relative-prices-weighed averages of beef and goat
 consumed (see details below).
 If beef per unit-weight is cheaper than goat-per-unit-weight, then this
 quality metric would evidently be lower when more beef is consumed for
 the same expenditure.
 This notion of higher-quality is thus based solely on price alone so that
 a more expensive item within the commodity group contribute to higher quality
 of the commodity.

Let's consider an example to illustrate how the measure of quality would
 relate with the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 in the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the group aggregate price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 for a more detailed theoretical discussion).
 Let's say we observe the consumption on goat and beef within a meatsproteins
 commodity with prices observed as 20£, 10£ (resp.) and the quantities consumed
 by the household are 1.5 kg and 2 kg (resp.).
 One approach is to the treat the physical sum of quantities i.e.
 3.5 kg as the quantity of the composite good 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meatsproteins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, it is more difficult to argue that the households optimise the
 weight of the composite good - rather than comparing the disparate quantities
 of goods (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for details of this argument).
 Since quality is to be priced in the market, a quality-adjusted quantity
 is the more appropriate formulation where we consider a price-structured
 weighted quantity as the quality-adjusted quantity and express the pair
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(p_{goat},q_{goat}),(p_{beef},q_{beef})\}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $=\{(20,1.5),(10,2)\}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,5(=2\times1.5+1\times2))$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.43$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $=\frac{5}{1.5+2})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(P_{meats},Q_{meats}),$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(0,V_{meats})\}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $=\{(10,5),(0,1.43)\}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{meats}$
\end_inset

) is simply the minimum of 
\begin_inset Formula $20,10$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the prices of goat and beef respectively - corresponding to the price-structure
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is (2,1) for {goat, beef}.
 In other words, consuming 1.5 kg of goat (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{goat}=1.5$
\end_inset

 ) is equivalent to consuming 3 units of commodity:

 kg of goat and 3 kg of beef so that the prices and quantities are 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(20,0.5),(10,3)\}$
\end_inset

 respectively for goat and beef, we have the same expenditure as before
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}=P_{G}Q_{G}=\sum_{G}p_{i}q_{i}=40$

 However, as shown in the table below, the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 and quality 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}$
\end_inset

 now corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,4(=2\times0.5+1\times3))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.14=\frac{4}{3.5})$
\end_inset

 The quality is lower for the latter household even though the sum of physical
 quantities - rather than quality-adjusted 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 - is the same.

 Thus one of the commodity group (chicken) - which does not correspond to

 10 commodities in total.
 The system of equation is thus used to observe the variation of measures
 of quality across the total expenditure and household characteristics in
 Tanzania.
 The entire set of equations consists of two equations for each commodity
 (10) - where one equation (per commodity) has budget-share as the dependent
 variable and another equation has quality-metric as the dependent variable.
 These 
\begin_inset Formula $10\times2=20$

 equations with respective constraints are listed in Appendix IV.
 The AIDS estimation for the system of equations that accommodates the constrain
ts uses a 3SLS method (instead of SUR - which requires at least one regressor
 not used in other equations).

The data used for our analysis has been obtained from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World Bank - for the year 2014
 - which is the last wave in the survey.
 The survey has been designed to assist in the understanding of links between
 asset ownership, community access (to market, schools), food prices and
 agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys from multiple countries is largely uniform in its
 data-model (fields) and is often geo-referenced with a sufficiently wide-covera
ge in the country to allow a study of spatial variation in the observed
 variables.
 The years used for the analyses are the most recent years in the survey
 for Tanzania (2014) i.e.
 the last wave available in the survey at the time of writing this chapter.
 The price-data which we used in the classification described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The LSMS survey records past expenditure with diary and recall methods.
 The diary method is used for food items while other purchases are recorded
 as weekly, monthlw and yearly recalls.
 The expenditures on food are recorded with a greater level of detail than
 other expenditures.
 The demographic variables from survey that we use in our a cross-sectional
 analysis are based on the current locality and the number of members in
 the family.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption microdata for the year (2014) - used for budget shares and
 quality measures - is combined from across the recall and weekly diaries
 - merging the weekly data with yearly data by multiplying the past week's
 consumption into the number of weeks in the year.
 The details of this process are described in Appendix I.
 Once combined, the market prices for the goods consumed by a household
 are matched with the reported consumed quantities of the food items

The absence of a good in the recall record for a household as the good is
 not to be interpreted as evidence of non-usage of the good.
 With the case of electricity, for example, the field for

The prices relevant for a household are marked as those that are available
 as market prices in the district where the household is located.
 Since the market-observed prices in the survey are recorded at every district
 level or at finer levels, we match these prices with every household in
 the survey based on the district the household is located in.
 This is necessitated also because not all wards and enumerated-areas(EAs)
 within every district in the survey have prices recorded for all relevant
 food items.
 Further, as price observations at the district level are recorded in different
 quantities (grams, kilograms for weight and litres, mls for fluids etc.),
 we infer the price at the district level using a regression over price
 records for the good in the district.
 This is only a means to standardise the prices in a standard unit such
 as a kilogram or a litre from the prices that are recorded in several units.
 Since the price per unit of any item declines with the increase in quantity
 purchase, the price data from across different recorded quantities are
 assimilated using a regression to obtain the price corresponding to a standard
 unit-quantity of an good (kg, litres etc.).
 A simple quadratic expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{m}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$

 to used to approximate the inverse proportionality of price-per-unit with
 the quantity purchase.
 Thus, observed marked-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

 are regressed against the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 they're recorded in where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$

 The price of any arbitrary quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}$

 of a good is thus simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{\underline{q}^{2}}+c$

 and for the price of unit-quantity that we use for base-prices and relative

\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}=1$

 ).

\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values of assets owned by the household that we use as a measure for
 wealth are obtained from the record of durable goods in the survey.
 The durable goods in the LSMS data range from short-term durable items
 such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such as land
 or housing.
 Of these, we are interested only in the transferable long-term owned assets
 (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Long-term-assets"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The exclusion of short-term assets or the items that are not transferred
 over a generation is based on consideration of wealth whose relevance is
 sought as an SES measure.
 The empirical studies often prefer the data on ownership of assets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for SES effects since the inter-generational transfers of wealth are what
 make a break in the inequality gap (i.e.
 mobility through reduction of wealth differences) difficult 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ObasuyiEducationInequality2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Another reason why the income data has not been used directly in the current
 study is that it is available only for around 30% of the households that
 we have the diary data for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assets transferred over a generation that we use for SES measures can
 be readily verified by inspecting households in the data that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household - treating
 the assets except land and house that are more expensive than the bed (furnitur
e) as those that contribute to the long-term asset-values.
 The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include
 the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods - rather than reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 - to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding the household for two
 reasons.
 First, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to the errors associated with the recall of the purchase
 value which varies over years in the panel data for the household and item.
 Second, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 also encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time
 - making it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable consumption
 at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the household and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

.

 It is worth emphasising that FAO standards do not prescribe what's considered
 a low dietary diversity status and it is common for studies to therefore
 consider empirically validated thresholds for the analysis of diversity.

The spatial distribution of food insecurity provides us an overview of regional
 disparities in the country.
 To survey food insecurity, we use the directly observed food deprivation
 in the survey to compare the fraction of households having run out of food
 (either due to lack of agricultural inputs or high prices) in the past
 year across urban and rural areas (see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionAgInp"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionHiCost"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the figures do suggest a significant proportion of households running
 out of food in urban areas (due to high costs), the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons- see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionHiCost"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the food insecurity does not seem significantly stronger in either
 urban or rural areas, the extremity of urban-rural or regional differences
 seems evident from a comparison of assets and occupations.
 As a non-parametric view of occupations

 suggest a relevance of permanent income (measured with total expenditure)
 and ownership of assets - along with access to electricity - on the demand
 for quality in food.
 While there is a some heteroskedasticity in the results (tested for with
 Breush-Pagan statistic), the effects of household expenditure and total
 assets owned appear significant for quality.

In Table

, the effect of permanent income (
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 ) is positive on quality across all food commodities i.e.
 the income-elasticities are positive for quality within food categories
 (commodities).
 This does not seem surprising since the income-elasticities for quality
 are expected to be positive so long as a higher total expenditure 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 is spent on the more expensive variants (goods) within a food category
 (commodity).
 The negative income elasticities for budget-share of some food commodities
 are also predictable - if we consider that certain goods are preferred
 for higher (price-based) quality and therefore lower quantity (budget share).
 Of particular attention is how the budget shares show a decline with total
 expenditure logarithm for commodities 
\family typewriter
fat 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 (see coefficients of

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

) .
 More specifically, the increase in food expenditure is associated with
 less quantity (at the cost of higher quality) of 
\family typewriter
fats 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 - while quality consumed for both fats and meats-proteins rises with higher
 total expenditure logarithm (see coefficients of

).
 With cereals, on the other hand, we see that the budget shares rise with
 higher total expenditure logarithm (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qcereals
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 logarithm (see coefficient of

\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 The demand for quality (price-based) for meat is unlike that for cereals
 in the sense that higher-income households increase both price-based quality
 and quantity (budget-shares) for cereals whereas they seem increase quality
 without increasing quantity (budget shares) for meats.

Looking at the effect of access to electricity (

\family default
 ) in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we see a higher quality across food categories - an effect similar to
 that of total expenditure logarithm 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp 
\family default
(except for fats where quality is not significantly higher for consumers
 with access to electricity).
 It could be argued that having access to electricity is endogenous with
 higher prosperity.
 Thus it may simply be that those with higher income are the one with access
 to electricity and have a better access to quality through ownership of
 electric appliances.
 However, the correlation of having access to electricity with prosperity
 is more likely through being in the urban area rather through income.
 This is because the indicator variable 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
used for access to electricity is based only on the usage of electricity
 as the primary source of lighting at home.
 The basic usage of electricity hardly reflects the income of the household
 - and is more strongly correlated with being in an area (more often urban)
 where electricity is available (particularly given the sparse distribution
 of electricity in Tanzania).
 Since availability of refrigeration facilities in a market may improve
 the availability of fruits and meats in a wider area, the positive externality
 through being in richer areas - one that includes access to electricity
 - is more likely to be the cause for higher quality in food categories.

The effects of

 on quality are also worth noting - as larger families (higher

 but lower their budget-share for consumption.
 This may struggle in maintaining high quality in larger families with children.

A key advantage of using the proposed framework of quality is that it allows
 us to examine the effect of prices of commodities on quality.
 Looking at the effect of (base-)prices (variables

) in both Tables 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_elecassets_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we see with 
\family typewriter
lpmeatsproteins
\family default
 - for example - that the high base-price of meats-proteins (the cheapest
 meat-protein available in the district) corresponds to higher quality in
 
\family typewriter
fruits
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
veg
\family default
.
 Thus, the households in districts where base-price of 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins 
\family default
(price of cheapest meat-protein) is high also avail higher quality of fruits
 and veg - an indication of how meat consumption may be associated with
 higher income in Tanzania.

The results in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 also suggest certain substitutions in quality across some food commodities.
 For example, with a rise in prices of cereals (
\family typewriter
lpcereals
\family default
), the quality in meats-proteins (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpcereals
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVmeatsproteins
\family default

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

) increases but the quality in starches (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpcereals
\family default

\family typewriter
qVstarches
\family default

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

) and vegetables (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter

\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVveg 
\family default
in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ) declines - indicating that the consumers tend to increase quality in
 meat-consumption while reducing the quality for starches and veg.
 In other words, with higher prices of (cheapest) meat, the consumer is
 more likely to increase quality elsewhere (e.g., in fruits and vegetables)
 - indicating once again how meat consumption rises with higher income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On similar lines, we see that the quality in starches seems to drop with
 rise in prices of fruits (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpfruits
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVstarches
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) whereas the quality in fruits does not rise with the base-price of starches
 (see coefficient of 
\family typewriter
lpstarches
\family default
 under 
\family typewriter
qVfruits
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 In other words, when (cheapest) fruit is more expensive, starch quality
 is also lower for consumers whereas (cheapest) starch being more expensive
 does not raise the quality of fruits for consumers.
 It is more often thus that the consumers spend higher on quality in starches
 when the fruits become expensive (rather than spending higher on quality
 in fruits when starch becomes more expensive).
 A similar relation is not seen between tubers and starches whose consumption
 of quality seem to move together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observation from the budget shares that the expenditure on 
\family typewriter
veg
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 is higher - particularly for 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 - in urban areas can also be verified with a simple calculation of total
 expenditure divided by the commodity base-price.
 Estimating the effective quantity of 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 consumed as the 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 expenditure divided by its base-price, the urban areas seem to consume
 about 1.61 times more 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 and spend 1.63 times more (comparing just expenditure) - not as much for
 the expenditure on 
\family typewriter
chicken
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
fish
\family default
.
 With effective quantity of 
\family typewriter
veg
\family default
, the urban areas consume about 1.1 times more 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 and spend also about 1.1 times more than the rural areas.
 Looking at the expenditures in urban and rural areas for 
\family typewriter
cereals
\family default
, we see that unlike with 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
, the differences in expenditure (or in effective quantity) for 
\family typewriter
cereals
\family default
 across urban and rural areas and are not wide.
 The expenditures also suggest that while the consumption of 
\family typewriter
veg
\family default
 rises with total expenditure logarithm 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 , it does not rise as much as 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 in urban areas and does not differ a lot from the expenditures in rural
 areas.

 is used as the main explanatory variable instead of total expenditure 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp

 - the coefficient of total assets logarithm is positive for meatsproteins
 (dependent variable:

\family default
) - suggesting that those with lower assets do consume less 
\family typewriter

\family default
overall.
 In other words, the lower quantity of

\family default
for those with low-assets-ownership does not mean a higher quality in

 The quality consumed for meats-proteins does rise with higher total assets

 Comparing with cereals, on the other hand, we see that the budget shares
 are lower for those with higher total assets - even though the quality

 The budget shares rise for fruits and milk in Table

 whereas they fall for fat (

) and meatsproteins (
\family typewriter

\family default
) - even though the quality metrics rise (both 
\family typewriter
qVfat
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

) for the consumers having electricity.
 This may be due to refrigeration storage facilities available in certain
 localities.
 The consumption of fish (budget shares 
\family typewriter

\family default
) is not affected by the 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
variable as much as 
\family typewriter
meatsproteins
\family default
 - suggesting a higher local consumption for fish (likely less dependent
 on refrigeration facilities overall).
 For fruits and milk on the other hand, both the quality consumed and budget-sha
re are higher for consumers with access to electricity (see Table

 (apart from the base-price

) on quality is significant on quality across all food categories.
 This could be an indication of higher income occupations concentrated in
 the eastern coast and centre of Tanzania.
 More specifically, quality for meatsproteins (

 ) is slightly lower in urban areas (compare coefficients of

) and is better with access to electricity.
 In other words, those with no access to electricity in the urban areas
 are less likely to spend higher on quality of meats-proteins compared to
 the consumers in rural areas.
 The effects of both total expenditure and assets-ownership are significant
 in the quality of consumption for food.
 The access to electricity in urban environment creates clear differences
 in lifestyle choices as well as dependence on higher budgets - an effect
 that remains significant for access to quality in nutrition.
 In summary, even though there may be some positive externality with being
 in the urban areas, the differences in quality of consumption associated

While the question of whether higher quality for food can be considered
 aspirational or not could be answered only after surveys of subjective
 well-being of consumers, there are two observations pertaining to determinants
 of aspirational consumption that we can make from the above results.
 First, the demand for quality is strong for specific food items (rather
 than across wider nutritional categories).
 Second, the role of regional identity is likely to be strong towards aspiration
al consumption due to the extreme life-style differences between urban and
 rural areas.
 The observations seem to be supported by the presence of a strong positive
 externality with rich surroundings in the data on subjective-welfare in
 LSMS survey in Tanzania as well

As a test of the robustness of results, we calculate the food-quality using
 the market-provided prices and instead of the expenditure reported by the
 household.
 More specifically, in the results shown in Tables

 and

, we have used diary-costs on goods as reported by the household - costs
 that are recorded by the LSMS for the goods that were consumed from purchases
 in the last week.
 If a household didn't purchase anything in the past week, there would only
 be quantities consumed (not costs) that would be reported for the household
 in the diary.
 Since we have the market-prices available, another way to calculate costs,
 budget-shares and quality would be to infer costs as the multiple of market-pri
ces from the quantities consumed in the past week (which is reported for
 all households regardless of whether they had purchased something in the
 last week or not).
 Recalculating quality and budget shares still shows us the same economic
 and statistical significance (results available on request) of electricity
 and household assets in quality of food categories (commodities).

% The education rank is set to 1 for all pre-primary levels, to rank 2 for
 until the completion of primary education, to rank 3 for up to the secondary
 education level and to 4 for all higher education levels (higher-secondary,
 university etc.).
 For instance, the primary school leaving exam is taken at D7 in Tanzania
 and corresponds to the education rank 2 ; all standards above D7 correspond
 to the education rank 3 and so forth.
 The complete mapping is provided in Table 
\backslash
ref{education_rank_tnz}.
 The argument for using the education-ranks as instruments is simply that
 a higher food quality in food is unlikely to be favoured by differences
 in education levels.
 In other words, while quality - in general - could be constrained due to
 occupational structures in the economy, there are few reasons to think
 that purchases of food could be influenced by one's education level except
 through the permanent income measure.

\begin_layout Standard
The availability of market-prices and the details on household characteristics
 as well as owned assets allow us to understand the extent to which quality
 may be segregated by differences in income and urbanisation levels.
 Given the disparate consumer baskets for the urban and rural households
 as well as the disparity in household incomes, the differences in expenditure
 on quality is hardly surprising - but differences in quality for meat and
 fresh goods esp for urban households with access to electricity indicates
 a peculiar environmental difference in areas where urban amenities are
 available.
 Whether we use the income measure based on the total expenditure or the
 measure of assets, the relatively affluent households appear to avail significa
ntly higher quality and diversity in food - particular in the meats-proteins
 category.
 Further, the apparent demand for higher quality of meats-proteins - seems
 a consequence of increasing urbanisation and availability of appliances
 (as well as storage facilities in urban areas) - a trend that may not be
 aligned with improvements in nutritional diversity.

 Under these conditions, a consideration of life-style changes arising out
 of urbanisation seems essential for the treatment of a specific consumption
 category as aspirational.
 One cannot deny that the rise in consumption - when considering food quality
 which has an evidential role for status in a developing economy such as
 Tanzania - may be largely a result of increasing urbanisation in the context
 of SSA.

This interpretation of empirical results also fits in with the observation
 on the role of positive externality identified by studies on subjective
 welfare in Tanzania.
 More specifically, while poor relative incomes are meant to be strongly
 related with the general happiness and future outlook of a consumer, the
 evidence from the LSMS data suggests that the positive externalities from
 being in a richer area significantly influence the consumer's happiness
 levels recorded in the survey as well 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The improvements in food quality indicate a particular channel of how positive
 externalities from being in richer areas might influence the quality of
 life and the subjective welfare of the resident consumers.

 In summary, while it is difficult to treat the rise in food quality with
 income as generally aspirational, the effects of both urbanisation and
 income on quality suggest that such consumption should continue to rise
 with improvements in household incomes as well as urban development.
 However, with food as the most basic of needs and one where higher price-based
 quality seems easy to achieve for the markets, the positive effects of
 income on quality seem also likely to remain - thus also limiting the future
 rise in high-quality consumption.

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock goods for consumption.
 The LSMS survey records the quantities for food goods - even if they were
 not purchased in the past week.
 But for other non-food goods (such as soap, skin creams whose quantities
 are not recorded in the survey) are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families as well.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption.
 To verify that this not a significant issue, we first test if such stocking
 (quantities purchased) may be uniform in all region in the country.
 We then test the significance of household factors that may affect long-term
 storage (e.g., household size or distance from market) of the purchased item.
 Observing the quantity purchased on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure on all goods 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we use a difference-in-means analysis to confirm the low effect of travel-cost
s on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{e}{x})$
\end_inset

 and conclude that stockpiling is not significant.
 It turns out that the number of family members is a far more significant
 factor for large purchases.

For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wide categories of energy and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.

% A lot of goods in the year 2008 were recorded with the unit as pieces/"idadi"
 (e.g., 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis.
 These goods were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,
 pulses, peanuts, coconut, onion, greens, dried_canned_veg, banana_ripe,
 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk goods where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the goods where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not

 that a substitution between two goods is possible only if they belong to

 than a claim on household's behaviour (see

 Notice that the inverse-mills instrument must also comply with the symmetry

\begin_inset Formula $-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\delta_{i}R_{ih}$

The first step with the selection approach is a probit where the dependent
 variable is an indicator variable that is unity when the item is consumed
 and zero otherwise.
 The control variables used in the first-stage probit are the prices of
 the item and market-characteristics (region etc.
 - see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_probit"

\end_inset

) .
 The inverse-mills ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the

 - see

) is then used as an instrument in the AIDS regressions(see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation.

The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).
 The results thus obtained with a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) after
 imposing the constraints are presented in the Table

The above item-wise analysis suggests a split between the goods that are
 consumed in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant)
 against those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer
 are more readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education show that the goods available
 in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive elasticitie
s for income and education rank whereas the goods of agrarian production
 seem to matter less to the highlw educated, middle-age populations huddled
 in the urban areas.
 Similarly, how households respond to changes in kerosene and electricity
 prices indicates the limited availability of industrial goods.
 A contrast between the goods that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this urban-rural
 split as well (demand for goods such as rice, beef is less sensitive to
 electricity than it is to kerosene).
 It isn't simply that the households with electricity are more likely to
 consume the more expensive goods (due to their higher incomes) but that
 a certain goods become less relevant in the urban settings or are simply
 unavailable in the rural settings.

\begin_layout Standard
Going further, the signs of the coefficients suggest that mangoes (less
 consumed) and rice (commonly consumed) to be substitutes while fish appears
 as a complement to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.)
 rice.
 Similarly, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_f
lour]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens - while it is a substitute to bread
 and mangoes respectively.
 The substitution and complementarity thus observed are hardly an indicator
 of the overall quality since the reported cross-price elasticities do not
 consider the functional separation.
 More specifically, one cannot make much out of the cross-elasticities of
 kerosene with respect to buns or cassava unless without imposing strict
 separability assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or model restrictions (such as more buns would means less cooking in the
 household etc.).
 An aggregated view of the basket is thus preferred given our interest in
 the choice of quality exercised by the household when faced with multiple
 varieties of several qualities and price.

\begin_layout Standard
It is common for the empirical studies in sub-Saharan Africa to use the
 income data only indirectly.
 There are two mains reasons for this.
 First, the income-data is much more sparse than for occupation or education
 (only about a quarter of households, for example, have income data available
 in the LSMS survey for Tanzania).
 Second, the predominance of informal sectors further subjects the income
 data to significant measurement errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the income data may not be of direct utility to its sparsity, it is
 useful in providing an overview of occupational differences in Tanzania.
 As the household occupation-data is more widely available than the income
 data, we use a mapping of incomes on to the list of occupational (ordered)
 ranks by sorting the occupations based on income.
 More specifically, the occupations are sorted based on the average income
 received and categorised in broad ranks ranging form 0 to 3 (non-paying
 occupations are unemployed status is set to 0 and a higher-rank corresponds
 to a higher-income occupation).
 The occupation ranks thus assigned are shown in Table

ref{occupation_rank_tn}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The variation in education levels is also given a similar treatment and
 used as education ranks for comparison.
 In other words, an ordered variable corresponding to the varied education
 levels is inferred as occupation-rank based on income received by the highest-e
ducation level recorded for individuals in the data.
 The mappings from education-levels to education ranks are listed in Table

The economies in sub-Saharan Africa show significant permanent income effects
 which limit wider access to higher education in the region.
 Given the status value of education in the region, we examine the extent
 of limitations on education expenses in the context of aspirational consumption
 and compare effects of permanent income against regional wealth on education
 expenses in Tanzania and Nigeria across differing levels of availability
 of education facilities.
 The results indicate that the availability of secondary-education facilities
 can have a stronger effect than that of permanent income in a typical developin
g economy and may thus contribute to a widespread rise in such consumption
 of status value across the region

 Due to the persistent long-term effects of insufficient household wealth

 and deficient non-formal education initiatives 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

\end_inset

, it may appear that secondary or higher education is likely to remain a
 luxury for the richer sections of the society in SSA.
 The presented chapter argues - however - that an extreme variation in urban
 developments and education attainment levels suggest that wealth effects
 may be ultimately less important for education expenses than the uneven
 access to education facilities and disparate urbanisation in the region.
 So far as education can be considered of aspirational value (often in economies
 where education attainment has been historically low), the observation
 also has a significance in the context of aspirational consumption since
 education expenses would be likely to rise broadly across varied socio-economic
 levels in response to urban development - becoming a wider common need
 for the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To elaborate this view, we compare education expenses in two economies in
 the region with respect to the effects of household permanent income against
 regional wealth levels.
 Comparing Tanzania and Nigeria - countries that bear similar geographical
 and demographic metrics while exhibiting significant differences in economic
 development and their degree of dependence on agrarian production - we
 find a strong role of availability of education facilities on education
 expenses and that of local wealth (accumulation of assets).
 The results of a comparison between slightly more urbanised economy with
 a relatively less urbanised economy also suggest that a rise in local asset
 ownership should coincide with reduction of permanent income effects on
 education over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of household permanent income on education - i.e.
 the extent to which the household permanent income contributes to education
 expenses - are commonly observed through various mechanisms.
 Other than through costs (such as transportation) imposed on households
 when public education access is poorer, the household income also influences
 access to education due to information asymmetries that may help in future
 job-searches, better representations in the nascent political institutions
 of developing economies or certain social characteristics that align with
 higher household income

At the same time, the uneven urbanisation also requires us to consider the
 extreme variation in local wealth for the context of aspirational consumption
 in the region.
 While household wealth is often reported to be more important than physical
 access for education expenses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"

\end_inset

, the extreme regional variation in wealth and the peer-effects that they
 may imply must also be factored in when considering rises in per-capita
 expenditure.
 Despite the limitations posed by wealth and permanent income, the overall
 effect of urban development could be that of a broad overall increase in
 education expenses.
 A few idiosyncratic reasons may contribute to such effects as well - for
 example, many countries in SSA have heeded the policy recommendation in
 the last decades to prefer wider access to primary education over selective
 provision of secondary-level education

 - thus letting rapid urban developments create a high demand for education.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting aside the physical access to education - i.e.
 the higher availability of education opportunities in urban areas which
 we consider as a separate control - the two fundamental mechanisms how
 local wealth may influence education expenses are the relative abundance
 of opportunities for higher income employment and the social environment
 of the urban areas.
 The better opportunities of employment and wealth overall make education
 more affordable so that the households in rural areas - where incomes are
 invariably lower and education somewhat of a luxury- end up underinvesting
 in education.
 The social environment of urban areas is also often different - leading
 to a stronger need for finding education-dependent employment in more economica
lly developed or high-asset areas.

The current study measures permanent income effects as the annual total
 household expenditure and uses the average assets in the immediate area
 surrounding the household as a measure of local wealth.
 The main goal of using local wealth - rather than urban-rural indicators
 - as an explanatory variable is to take into consideration the spatial
 variation of owned assets in the SSA without relying too much on the urban-rura
l dichotomy that have been recently criticised in the literature

 opportunities in the SSA rather than the broad or implicit urban-rural
 classifications used in surveys.
 The measurement for the local wealth uses the average assets-accumulation

The term

assets

 signifies the goods that are owned by the household.
 These constitute items that are more often referred to as durable goods
 in the consumption literature from the developed economies.
 There seem at least two reasons why the developing economics literature
 more often refers to the durable household possessions as assets.
 First, the financial assets are far less relevant in the developing economies.
 Second, the durable goods such as bicycles or stoves - however insignificant
 - are far more important for consumption behaviour in the developing world.

 With permanent income effects and local wealth effects as the main explanatory
 variables whose effects are compared after controlling for physical access
 (availability of education opportunities) and social factors ( religious
 identity etc.), the study finds that the household permanent income effects
 for education to be more severe in less urbanised areas.
 To compare this assessment with that using the more conventional approach
 using urban-rural indicators, we also provide estimation results from an
 alternative formulation where a ruralness-score of the district based on
 urban-rural distinction is used instead of the local wealth measure and
 the permanent income measure is replaced with the direct measure of household
 assets value (see Section

It is worth highlighting the importance of physical access as a control
 - a factor that directly influences education expenditure in the above
 analysis.
 Given the focus on secondary education in development policy as well as
 literature in the last decades

, we focus on the role of accessibility of secondary education as a control
 in the two economies.

 the effects of physical access in empirical studies from the region

% The control in fact often plays a critical role in determining whether
 a given amount of funds is more appropriately used to build accessible
 schools or to support and economise education instead.
 More specifically, if physical access for education is what prevents the
 attainment of education, then building more schools becomes of higher priority.
 On the other hand, if permanent income effects are stronger in the economy,
 then affordability of education becomes an important issue - even if returns
 to education were a cause of concern.
 Whether returns to education are enough to increase education participation
 for lower-income households or not - also often hinges on there being less
 significant income effects and sufficient physical access to education
 in an economy.

 The other relevant social factor that may favour participation in education
 is the main occupation in the household.
 More particularly, the agrarian or non-agrarian nature of the household
 occupation in a largely agrarian economy may indicate a non-transactional
 advantage for individuals through the social networks they acquire.
 Other household characteristics of social significance that influence participa
tion in education vary across the economies.
 In Tanzania, for example, the speakers of English language seem to be generally
 more educated and have higher incomes.
 The ability to speak English could indicate an exposure to education in
 ways that the poorer or rural households may not be exposed.
 The religious identities also have some implications for participation
 in education in countries such as Nigeria

 - which the empirical literature on determinants of education expenditure
 often relies on - is that the educational investments must change over
 the life cycle of consumers.
 The current chapter takes advantage of the reporting of household expenditures
 on education at individual level in the surveys for both the countries
 and considers how the education expenditure may vary with the age of the
 children in the household.
 The variables for childrens' ages are important for our comparison also
 because the education expenditures for a population where the majority
 joins the workforce after attaining primary education would be very different
 from one where the employment opportunities are higher for educated individuals.
 Since large households have higher basic needs than smaller households,
 we also consider the number of children as another relevant control that
 is closely related with lifecycle concerns.

As mentioned earlier, the two economies in SSA that we have selected for
 our comparison of education expenditure have different levels of economic
 development and a different degree of dependence on agrarian output.
 More particularly, Nigeria relies more heavily on energy exports while
 Tanzania's economy is more reliant on its agricultural output - a difference
 that is critical for the varied level of urbanisation in the two economies.
 While the educational attainments in the populations of the two countries
 are evidently shaped by the idiosyncrasies of the policy and distinct social
 factors, the varying levels of urban developments in the two economies
 have general implications for how demand towards education may rise in
 the region.

%Such implications are relevant not only for the context of aspirational
 consumption but also for general policy concerns for education in the economy.
 More particularly, if permanent income effects matter less in the urbanised
 areas i.e.
 if education is more egalitarian for residents in the urban areas (after
 controlling for physical access), then the policy may not need to focus
 on effects of permanent income alone and direct the attention to improving
 access more widely.
 On other hand, if permanent income effects are significant despite higher
 economic development in urbanised regions, then more attention is needed
 for improvement of access to education for lower-income households overall.

 and local wealth levels are the main explanatory variables in our comparison
 of educational expenditures while physical access to education, the social
 or demographic factors and the household characteristics serve as important
 controls.
 The first explanatory variable i.e.
 the permanent income of the household uses the logarithm of household's
 total annual expenditure - a measure from standard consumption theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that is commonly used in studies on consumption.
 The local wealth levels - used as the second explanatory variable - is
 based on average asset-ownership levels in the households' vicinity (district).
 The physical access to education - is measured with the number of secondary
 schools in every district so that a higher score of 
\family typewriter

 for a district implies more secondary schools in the district.
 Further robustness checks are conducted by redefining the local wealth
 measures which vary the boundaries of households vicinity and examine the
 significance of local wealth in the household's neighborhood of similar
 occupations (agrarian/non-agrarian) and education ranks (primary, secondary).

 Our main conclusion in the study is that so long as education can be considered
 of aspirational significance, the lower severity of permanent income effects
 with higher local wealth means that expenditure on education is likely
 to experience a significant rise as a common need across all sections of
 a society rather than being limited to a smaller richer section of the
 society.
 The conclusion is drawn, however, with the caveat that weakening of household
 permanent income effects must also overlap with improvements in employment
 opportunities and social equity.
 The current study finds that the segregation of education opportunities
 and the disparities in future employment opportunities across the country
 are more evident in Tanzania where urban-differences seem more extreme.

The current chapter contributes to the literature on aspirational by highlightin
g the role of urban developments and employing a generic assets-based framework
 for comparison across disparate developing economies.
 It demonstrates that despite the challenges of urban overpopulation, the
 effect of urban and economic development may be a desirable one for the
 education levels of the population and the lifestyle improvements in urban
 areas.
 The weakening in severity of permanent income effects with the rise in
 economic development could in fact indicate pathways to future improvements
 in income equality and reduction in education inequalities through developments
 of the industrial sector and rise in demand for education.
 For the context of aspirational consumption, the education expenditure
 thus becomes likely to continue to increase as a mass common need in the
 economies of SSA.

 The other reason is simply that the role of physical access and wealth
 distribution may be far more dominant than the issue of poor returns-to-educati

 While there should be little doubt on that the concerns for return-to-education
 are important, they do need to be viewed in the context of effects of permanent
 income and availability of education facilities.
 More specifically, it is possible that the demand for education is suppressed
 due to inadequate income (relatively high prices of education) in the economy,
 structural regional differences or a sparse distribution of education opportuni
ties rather than due to lower pay from post-education employment opportunities
 alone.

As many such factors are shared by both Nigeria and Tanzania, the current
 study focuses only on the contexts that differentiate the two economies
 in the current chapter.
 In particular, we note that Nigeria has had more investments in commodities
 sector (oil and petroleum) than Tanzania - which remains a relatively agrarian
 economy.
 Additionally, the policy of education has also been different in the two
 economies - with Tanzania having a history of restrictions of secondary
 education at a time when other countries in the region were expanding their
 education sector

The goal of our empirical analysis is to find out if with rise in urban
 and economic development, the permanent income effects better explain the
 disparity in education expenses rather than local wealth in the two economies
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As mentioned earlier, our main formulation is based on the local wealth
 measure - whereas results are also provided with an alternative formulation
 based on urban-rural indicators for comparison.
 In the main formulation, the logarithm of total expenditure is used as
 the main explanatory variable while the local wealth measure - the second
 explanatory variable - is calculated as the average assets in the consumer's
 district (for smaller districts, the average over multiple districts within
 a 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 boundary is taken).
 In the alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators, the two explanator
y variables are the household wealth based on durable goods from the survey
 and a ruralness score based on urban-rural indicators.
 The measures for local-wealth (as well as the first explanatory variable
 in the alternative formulation) rely on the market-value of durable goods
 (including land, housing) that are reported in the survey (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Chapter2_Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 It is worth highlighting that the durable goods are considered as part
 of the consumer wealth only if they are transferable over generations.
 The ownership of goods that won't last more than a lifetime enter as consumptio
n for the household rather than as assets contributing to household wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a simple econometric model, the representative household balances i)
 her non-durable consumption (excluding education) with ii) increasing expenditu
re on education for the children.
 The non-durable consumption that the household may spend on excludes the
 expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and non-durable consumption excluding assets-related-c
osts thus form the consumer budget in the model.
 In this model for cross-sectional comparison of education expenses, we
 do not consider the substitution with savings towards durable goods.
 Other than our focus on cross-sectional effects, another reason why we
 avoid panel methods in the current study is a severe measurement error
 with time-varying household asset values in the survey (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Chapter2_Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details of asset values recorded in the consumption microdata).
 More specifically, the variation in time of ownership of assets is not
 accurate enough for us to measure the changing value of household assets
 possessions - due to the inconsistent recalls of the number of assets over
 time for the same household.

It is worth highlighting that the econometric analysis is limited for households
 having one or more children.
 In other words, only households with at least one member with their age
 less than 18 are considered in the analysis.
 Since the households with lower working age are likely to have less accumulatio
ns as well as needs, the average paternal age in the household is also used
 as a control in the comparison.

 The number of children (household-size), the educational level of the parents,
 the accessibility of schools in the district and the social characteristics

 controls used in the analyses.
 Notice that for the paternal educational levels, we use an educational

 the World Bank.
 The survey is unique in its and aims to improves the understanding of links
 between asset ownership, community access (to market, schools), food prices
 and agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys from multiple countries is largely uniform in its
 data-model (fields) and is often geo-referenced with a sufficiently wide-covera
ge in the country to allow a study of spatial variation in the observed
 variables.
 The years used for the cross-section analyses are the most recent years
 in the survey for Tanzania (2014) and Nigeria (2015) - i.e.
 the last waves available in the survey at the time of writing this chapter.

As described earlier, the local wealth measure uses the log-averages of
 the values of durable goods accumulated in a district (calculated as per
 the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited, we focus on durable goods that can be transferred over a generation.
 For both Tanzania and Nigeria, we therefore include items as long-term
 assets only if they are costlier than furniture - which is the cheapest
 asset to be transferred between the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 These costs are used both for the local-wealth measures and the assets-measure.
 As explained earlier, the permanent-income measure uses the logarithm of
 total expenditure at the household level.

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data for Tanzania.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geo-coding of districts for the
 wider level consumer vicinity based on Euclidean distance.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards
 in the 6

 A district with a higher score has more wards that have a secondary school
 in close vicinity (within 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$

 This measure takes care of the issue that there are many wards (and enumerated-
areas within) having consumer entries for assets and consumption that the
 school-availability (primary as well as secondary ) is not recorded for.
 The aggregation over districts takes care of this issues there are no district
 with consumer entries for assets and consumption that we don't have the
 total number (score) of secondary-schools for.
 This score evidently also factors in the high-population density in urban
 areas since densely populated districts would have more wards within the

The next important control is the occupation of the households which is

 Whether an occupational sector is agriculture-related or not determined
 is based on the main occupation of household head (HH).
 The number of children in the household, the ages of the children (and
 other members) are directly observed in the data.
 Since the typical household unit in Tanzania and Nigeria may not be a nuclear
 family, the paternal educational level - which is another important control
 in the study - cannot simply be the education level of the household head(HH).
 This is because unlike for nuclear families, the individuals on whom the
 household's reported  education expenses are spent, could be the grandchildren
 (rather than children) of the joint-family household-head.
 To avoid letting the household's paternal education level point to the
 generation before the parents of children for certain joint-family households
 - where the HH has his/her grandchildren attending school - while letting
 the same variable point to the parents of children in school for nuclear-famili
es (where HH has his/her children attending school), we rely on a more uniform

While the maternal education level is often a more appropriate control for
 effects of parental education level on whether the child enters education
 or not and more generally on the individual education expenses for a child,
 our focus on the cross-sectional variation of education expenditure aggregated
 at the household-level offers a preference to the father's education rank
 solely because other characteristics of the household such as age and occupatio
n are linked with the household heads who are invariably male in the survey.
 In other words, we do not offer a preference to mother's education level
 over father's education level as the paternal education control in the
 analysis only due to normalisation of household characteristics at the
 household-head level.

 O course (Diploma) correspond to the education rank 3 and all education
 levels at or above O course correspond to education rank 4 for Tanzania.
 Similarly, the levels above P6 - which is the highest primary education
 level in Nigeria - implies an education rank 3 (corresponding to P6 in
 Tanzania) and all education levels at or above the technical training level

 rank 4.

 To control for the price of consumption in the household's district, we
 also use the non-durable consumption averages 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 (excluding the costs associated with ownership of assets in the survey).
 The measurement 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 of price is akin to the price-deflator (unit-value) methods used in the
 demand literature

.
 The rationale for excluding costs associated with assets is that the costs
 of maintaining assets (fees, repair costs, usage costs etc.) are not levied
 on those who don't own the related assets and should not be included in
 the general price of non-durable consumption.

\begin_layout Standard
Despite similarities in geographic areas, age-distribution of populations,
 public infrastructure and use of English as the primary administrative
 language, the economies of the two countries on Eastern and Western coasts
 of Africa exhibit quite a few structural differences - owing primarily
 to levels of industrialisation and endowments in natural resources.
 Tanzania is spread over nearly 885,800 sq km of land while Nigeria sprawls
 over 910,768 sq km of total land.
 The age-distribution of the populations and the dependency ratio are similar
 in the two economies while the population growth rate remains under 3%.
 As of 2020, Nigeria had a population of 206.1 million and Tanzania's population
 was 59.7 million (source: World Bank).
 The differences in public infrastructure do not appear to be extremely
 wide - since Tanzania has a total of 145,203 km length of roadways while
 Nigeria has 195,000 km (based on a 2022 estimate).
 With nearly 43% of land in Tanzania being agricultural and over 37% of
 the land being forest land (based on a 2018 estimate), urban residents
 are more numerous in Nigeria - where agricultural land is nearly 78% of
 the total land and leaves only 9.5% of forest land.
 Only 36.7% of the population is urban in Tanzania whereas urban residents
 constitute 53.5% of the population in Nigeria (2022 estimates).
 The differences in urbanisation levels across the two economies seem stable
 - since the rate of urbanisation is nearly the same in the two economies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher urbanisation in Nigeria is not without severe disparities in
 living standards.
 The infant-mortality in Nigeria (56.68 /1000) - for example - is in fact
 nearly double that of Tanzania (30.87/1000) and the per-capita availability
 of physicians remains lower in Nigeria (0.38/1000) relative to Tanzania
 (0.7/1000).
 The overall literacy is slightly better in Tanzania as well - with 77.9%
 population considered literate (above 15 years of age having the ability
 to read or write in any language) compared to 62% in Nigeria.
 Even though the countries have similar school life expectancy (9 years),
 the youth unemployment (between ages 15-24) is at a staggering 18.3% in
 Nigeria compared to 3.9% in Tanzania.
 The overall poverty also seems more widespread in Nigeria - with 40.1% below
 the poverty line (estimate) compared to 26.4% of the population living below
 the poverty line in Tanzania (2017 estimate).
 This is despite higher income inequality in Tanzania which has a Gini-coefficie
nt for household income of 40.5 (2017 estimate) compared to 35.1 for Nigeria
 (2018 estimate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A brief overview of the two economies using data from OECD (Organisation
 for Economic Cooperation and Development) suggests that of the two economies,
 a higher percent of the GDP comes from agricultural production in Tanzania.
 The per-capita GDP 2020 for Nigeria (2396.04 USD) is much higher than that
 of Tanzania (976.16 USD) (source World Bank).
 The GDP from manufacturing, mining and construction is nearly double for
 Nigeria (8749.61 million USD in 2022) compared to Tanzania (4221.41 million
 USD in 2021).
 Nigeria's GDP from agriculture is 9311.36 million USD and Tanzania's is
 4313.47 million USD.

The structural differences seem to be due to a higher reliance on energy
 exports for Nigeria - which, as of 2020, exports $35.9 billion crude-gas
 and imports $7.75 billion of refined Petroleum apart from cars ($3.03 billion)
 and wheat ($2 billion).
 On the other hand, Tanzania's major exports are Gold and other minerals
 ($3 billion) followed by agricultural products (0.594$ billion).
 The major imports of Tanzania are refined copper and petroleum ($2.2B).
 Among the two economies, Nigeria relies less on the agrarian exports and
 more on the energy-related infrastructure - likely associated with the
 higher average education levels in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the political systems in the two countries, Tanzania has shown a higher
 propensity to state control as nearly all land resources in Tanzania are
 government-owned.
 Tanzania is also more uniform ethnically - as about 95% of Tanzanian nationals
 identify as Bantu.
 On the other hand, the ethnic composition is more varied in Nigeria with
 Hausa (30%), Yoruba (15.5%) and Igbo (15.2%) as prominent ethnic groups.
 The policy of education has also seen different directions in the two economies.
 At a time when other countries in the region were expanding their education
 sector, the secondary education opportunities had faced some restrictions
 in Tanzania

.
 The private education seems to have flourished with relatively fewer limits
 in Nigeria.
 The effects of all of these factors towards education expense should become
 clearer in further subsections.

Considering the overall distribution of education expenses, we see that
 the urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in both the economies.
 The urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents in Nigeria
 whereas they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for tertiary education (rank 3) is almost
 double that of the expenditure on secondary education (rank 2) in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these expenditures rise by about 54%.
 The educational expenses do not seem to rise much with asset disparities
 in Nigeria - whereas they seem to be more unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure

Despite the uniformity in LSMS data fields corresponding to education expenses,
 the collection methodology may not be the same across all the countries.
 This is evident from the much lower educational expenses in Nigeria than
 in Tanzania (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Our comparison of the two economies (Tanzania and Nigeria) therefore does
 not rely on the measurement of educational expenses relative to one another.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Comparing education levels of the household heads, we see that the average-educ
ation rank of the household heads in Tanzania (1.8) is lower than that in
 Nigeria(1.9).
 We also see that the role of private education is much higher in Nigeria
 (see Figure

 The average number of children in households that are of an age appropriate

 A clear difference between Tanzania and Nigeria - however - is that of
 standard-deviation in local wealth  (
\family typewriter
localwealth
\family default
) - which is higher for Tanzania.
 Further, the predominance of agricultural occupations (see stdev values
 for 
\family typewriter

\family default
) is higher for Tanzania as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth pointing that barring such broad observations, the LSMS data
 used in our analyses may not permit a cross country comparison for education
 expenses in a much finer detail.
 One reason is simply that the distribution of savings, income and employment
 opportunities may be too different in the two economies.
 The other reason is that there is also a difference in sizes or granularity
 of district classifications in the two economies.
 More specifically, the sizes of districts in Tanzania seem much larger
 (particularly in the rural parts) than in Nigeria.
 This is why the per-district density of secondary education facilities
 - which we measure with the variable 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 - is reported lower in Nigeria (see values corresponding to 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) - while the education levels of the consumer populations remains higher
 in Nigeria (see highest_educ in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 The ruralness of districts - measured as number of wards declared as rural
 in a district (i.e.
 the variable 
\family typewriter
rural_wards
\family default
) - does not seem affected by this disparity in sizes as much (compare the
 values for 
\family typewriter
rural_wards
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) - since a rural-urban classification that declares boundaries of a district
 based on areas surrounding an urban (or semi-urban) centre tends to bring
 a uniformity to the number of rural wards in a district.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the overall distribution of assets (durable
 goods stocks) in the two countries is disparate - as is clear with a direct
 comparison of asset values.

 for in Nigeria and Tanzania, we note that distribution of assets is more
 sparse in Tanzania even though the overall expenditure appears similarly
 distributed in the two countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A geographical distribution of assets further details that higher-income

 (Nigeria) are based on the standardisation of various occupations in Tanzania
 and Nigeria.
 Since the range of occupations in the surveys from Tanzania and Nigeria
 is varied, the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria
 have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey so that
 a higher occupation rank represents an occupation that provides higher
 income.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and the reporting
 of occupations in surveys from both the economies

 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the key observation from the data is that the disparities in income and
 durable goods are more localised in Nigeria while they are more extreme
 across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai

 (see Figure

To reiterate, a significant number of household units in both the economies
 are made up of joint families where the reported educational expenses correspon
d to the grandchildren of the household head (HH).
 The education level of the HH would thus point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and the previous generation for
 younger households where HH has young children.
 To resolve this disparity, we avoid using the education rank of the HH
 and instead use the highest education rank in the generation of the students'
 parents

 The tobit uses a lower limit of zero given a number of houses have no expenditu
re on education.
 A zero expenditure is reported for nearly 65% households in the survey
 from Nigeria (2015) and 43% households in the survey from Tanzania (2014).
 This suggests that either the education expenses are recorded in more detail
 in Tanzania or that a certain basic level of expenses is not considered
 in the survey for Nigeria.
 The particular disparity also limits our ability to compare educational
 expenses relative to one another for the two economies.

 This seems largely due to the educational expenses forming a higher proportion

 Thus while urban developments must raise the prices of non-durable expenditure

 In other words, the effect of lower or higher cost of living on education

 This is an indication of the regional disparities in the economies.
 More particularly, the differences in average assets accumulation indicate
 the local wealth has a strong effect on education expenses - despite controllin
g for the effect of physical access.
 While absence of educational facilities must clearly suppress education
 expenses in a region, the positive effect of local wealth after controlling
 for availability of education facilities coul be due to certain environmental
 factors that contribute to education - such as a competition towards higher
 income social positions or presence of occupations requiring higher levels
 of education - factors with an important role after the availability of
 educational facilities has been considered.

The effects of household total expenditure remain relevant - however - for
 private education - which is limited to the wealthier households in both

 While a higher proportion of young population seems to be in private schools
 in Nigeria (see Figure

 It also seems that the consumers are more likely to spend on primary education
 in Tanzania - as the access to secondary and tertiary-education remains
 much lower (this is further elaborated in discussion below of the results

 suggest a particular limitation of the use of urban-rural indicators from
 the survey.

 are negative and significant for Tanzania in Table

 However, the inference of a higher expenditure on education - when using
 urban-rural indicators - by the rural residents in Nigeria (see significance

 We also see that the educational expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$

 rises with the second explanatory variable i.e.
 the local wealth ( 
\family typewriter

 In the alternative formulation where urbanisation is measured with the
 ruralness score (

 The disparity in the role of

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing with the comparison of results with education-expenditure

 The education expenses in Nigeria therefore depend less often on whether
 education is provided through private educational institutions or not.
 The results also indicate lower attendance (based on age) to secondary
 and tertiary-education in Tanzania (see coefficients of secondary-school-age

 to be stronger for Nigeria when taking wealth i.e.
 total assets-worth logarithm

 The permanent income effect thus seems stronger than access in both the
 economies but is weaker for Nigeria where the enrollment into secondary
 and tertiary education is higher - regardless of the differences in long-term
 assets (measured with logarithm of assets-worth 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_assets
\family default
).
 The decomposed view of expenses on education in terms of secondary and
 primary education level further clarifies this observation - reflecting
 the far lower access to secondary education in Tanzania.

The role of the number of children (

numchild
\family default
) also seems stronger in Tanzania than in Nigeria - but the effect is likely
 due the education expenses primarily driven by the primary education levels
 in Tanzania (as well as a higher percentage of households reporting no
 education expenditure in the survey from Nigeria).
 Another consequence of most households spending on primary education alone
 is that the agrarian households appear as spending higher on education
 after considering the local wealth among households with the same educational-s
tatus.
 The education expenditure is higher for agrarian households in Tanzania
 after taking into account their poor educational status (see coefficients
 of agrarian-occupation-indicator

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of permanent income in Tanzania overall seem stronger, but they
 ought to be considered in light of the much lower expenditure on secondary

 taking into account the lower urbanisation levels) in Tanzania.
 The significance of logarithm of assets-worth (

 wealth and in urban areas (see significance of

and

\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$

 but a higher dependence on industrial output in Nigeria also seems to have
 contributed to a higher demand for secondary and tertiary education in
 the economy overall ( compare with significance of 
\family typewriter

 Another observation - the stronger role of father's education level in
 Tanzania - also seems related with these disparities in the two economies
 as well.
 A comparison of education expenditures across the two countries must take
 into account the different stages which the two countries appear to be
 in terms of urbanisation and economic development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the role of social environment is found significant in both the
 economies.
 The role of English language seems significant in Tanzania - where the
 English-speakers spend significantly higher on education (see coefficients
 of 
\family typewriter

 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the educational expenses are higher among
 households identifying as Christian (see coefficients of

 In both cases, the role of social characteristics may be rather inseparable
 from differences in educational institutions.
 In case of Tanzania, the ability to speak English is aligned with attending
 educational institutions while in Nigeria, the role played by Christian
 missionaries in establishment of educational institutions may be reflected
 in the disparity of access to educational facilities.

To confirm that the assets-ownership does influence the access to education,
 we inspect the role of assets in lower and higher sub-samples of the surveyed

While the role that the local wealth

 plays towards access to education appears similar for the rich and poor
 halves in a locality as well, we do see a higher economic significance
 of local wealth
\family typewriter
 localwealth

 for the below-median-assets household in Nigeria - possibly because of
 high education costs in urban areas where asset-possession may be lower.
 The access to private education seems more widerspread in Nigeria as the
 below-median households seem spend a higher budget-share on private-education.
 In Tanzania, on the other hand, the economic significance of private-education
 factor variable 
\family typewriter
educpriv 
\family default
(as well as tertiary level education ) is higher for above-median households.
 The significance of social factors - on the other hand - remains unaffected
 by whether the consumers have above or below the median asset ownership
 level.
 More specifically, the factor variables for English-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english
\family default
 and (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
religion 
\family default
) are significant in results from Tanzania and Nigeria (respectively) for
 both richer and poorer households.
 The factor variable for English-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english
\family default
 is significant for consumers both above and below media asset possession
 level (the coefficient for variable 
\family typewriter
religion 
\family default
is significant for Nigeria for above and below median asset possession level
 in Table

 The effect of secondary-schools

To ensure that the effect of assets remains strong after accounting for
 occupation or education level, we recompute the local wealth by considering
 only those in the household's vicinity with the same value of the indicator
 for primary/higher-than-primary education-level of the household-head and
 then again with the same value for the agrarian/non-agrarian occupation
 indicator.
 Three types of vicinities thus implied - are summarised in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:ReferenceDefinitions}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first interpretation is one that we have already described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Discussion"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 - where a simple average of the total assets owned by the households in
 the consumer's district is used.
 Both education rank and an agrarian-occupation factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the household head's occupation is agrarian or not are
 used as controls in this interpretation of the vicinity.
 The second interpretation of the vicinity presented as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{educ}$
\end_inset

 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabTNZNGR_reduc}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is based on a supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the education level of the household-head is higher
 than primary school or not.
 More specifically, this second interpretation uses the prosperity within
 the educational levels implied by supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is also used as the additional control in this second interpretation.
 Finally, the third interpretation of vicinity is based on the average prosperit
y in the agrarian vs non-agrarian occupations (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

) and uses educational rank as the additional control variable.
 The results from this third interpretation of vicinity are presented in

 (respectively) for Tanzania and Nigeria, we see again that while the local
 wealth corresponds to a rise in educational expenditure logarithm 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 for Nigeria, its effect is insignificant (whether one uses the local wealth
 in the supra-primary-educated neighbourhood 
\family typewriter
localwealth_educ 
\family default
or local wealth in the agrarian-neighbourhood 
\family typewriter
localwealth_agri
\family default
 ) for Tanzania.
 Further, since the coefficients for secondary-age indicator 
\family typewriter
is_secondaryage
\family default
 seem higher for the agrarian/non-agrarian vicinity (i.e.
 the coefficient for local wealth in 
\family typewriter
localwealth_agri
\family default
) than for the supra-primary education vicinity ( i.e.

\family typewriter
 
\family default
local wealth in 
\family typewriter
localwealth_educ

), it can be argued that education expenses are more often clustered by
 agrarian or non-agrarian occupations than by education levels the populations
 have attained.

We had set ourselves to examine the extent to which educational expenses
 are influenced by local wealth and household permanent income in Nigeria
 and Tanzania
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While there are idiosyncratic differences between the two countries we've
 used for our comparison, the weakening of effects of permanent income within
 high local wealth areas is a notable implication relevant to both the concerns
 for aspiration consumption and those of education policy in the region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the agrarian consumers maintain a high budget share on education expenses
 in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and since higher education ranks correspond
 to higher education expenses in the more developed economy (Nigeria), one
 can argue that the educational expenses are likely to remain high as more
 of the population attains education as the regional prosperity rises.
 This also seems aligned with the recent finding from a cohort-study by
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{porzio2021human}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that the labour with skills added through education is less willing to
 stay in agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main findings therefore that can be highlighted from the results
 in the chapter.
 First, the effects of local wealth are significant on education expenses
 in both the economies.
 Second, the lower wealth continues to prevent access to education and mobility
 in both the economies - even though rises in education expenses seem inevitable
 when the employment opportunities increase in an economy.
 In light of both the findings, the effects of permanent income as well
 as wealth-effects appear less extreme in the higher developed economy (i.e.
 Nigeria) than in the less developed economy (i.e.
 Tanzania).
 One can thus argue that the effects of permanent income appear to become
 weaker with rise in urban and economic development in the region.
 Considered as aspirational consumption, the educational expenses may thus
 continue to rise in the region with more local wealth accumulation.
 Such a rise associated with weaker effects of permanent income supports
 a view of conventional pathways to equity in both income and equality

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the view of education policy, the rise of education as a common need
 does not discount the need to improve access to education for the lower
 and middle-income populations in the region.
 While the literature notes a higher significance of wealth effects, the
 consideration of local wealth suggests that role of physical access may
 continue to be important in economies with wide disparities in urban developmen
t.
 This is of crucial importance also because the private educational institutions
 - which are more common in Nigeria - do not yet play a major role in the
 provision of education in the region.
 Instead, a more significant role continues to be played by the state-institutio
ns in both the economies.
 The role of social differences indicated by the significance of social
 characteristics in education expenses for both the economies - further
 emphasises the need to improve wider access to education.
 These findings seem aligned with the wider observations made by

In summary, the development of the education sectors seems to be at different
 stages of development in the Tanzania and Nigeria.
 The privatisation of education in Nigeria seems to have coincided with
 attendance of higher level education in a way that is yet to be seen for
 Tanzania - where education has not expanded as much yet.
 The effects of permanent income do seem strong in both the economies, but
 the relevance of local wealth in the population having higher education
 levels points to a promising albeit precarious direction where more urban
 developments could improve access to education and employment opportunities
 in the region while increasing expenses on education overall.

Unlike the typical high quality consumption, therefore, the education expenses
 may continue to evolve - subject to participation costs and inequalities
 - as a an expensive common need for the masses

The presented study had set out to reassess claims of rise in aspirational
 consumption with a view of changing consumers needs in the developing economies.
 With the theoretical implications of a short-term increase in aspirational
 investments under income inequalities and a varied role of household permanent
 income on food vs education expenses observed for SSA, we argue that aspiration
al consumption as investments towards future expected economic gains under
 an environment of inequalities may form an important part of the rise in
 consumption seen in developing economies that is not satisfactorily explained
 with the futility view of aspirational consumption.
 While the role of aspirational consumption in building social networks
 has been identified in both sociology and economics, empirical studies
 in economics have more often narrowed their focus to a visible appeal from
 aspirational consumption alone without considering the perceived future
 economic value from such consumption to the consumer.
 The presented study argues in favour of expectation-based approaches for
 analysis of aspirational consumption in the developing economies and urges
 for a more circumspect approach towards attribution of compensatory or
 excessive behaviour to the poor in particular.

\begin_layout Standard
The link between economic and social goals elaborated in the study serves
 to critique two commonly held views pertaining to empirical study of aspiration
al consumption.
 First is the generic view of aspirational goods in empirical studies for
 measurement of conspicuous consumption and second is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pure-status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 view that prevails more generally across empirical studies.
 The generic view of aspirational goods - treating all clothing, personal
 items etc.
 into a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conspicuous
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 category - not only ignores the quality variation in goods but in its attempt
 to achieve separability conditions for demand analysis, it also ends up
 treating all aspirational consumption as fundamentally futile.
 There are evident issues with such attributions across varied social contexts
 without a widely applicable criterion for maximal consumer needs.
 But the more serious limitations from the view are empirical.
 While pure-status view may be acceptable in settings connotating a rural
 or backward social fabric, the view faces theoretical concerns in relation
 to consumption 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007,truytssocialstatuseconomics2010}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and poses an empirical limitation when combined with the visible consumption
 view.
 More particularly, an approach that treats social goals as independent
 of economic goals (vis-a-vis the pure-status view) while also failing to
 demarcate private and visible utility appropriately (e.g with all clothing
 treated being of a conspicuous value relevant only for social goals) is
 susceptible to improper inferences of wasteful social tendencies.
 The unintended consequence of trying to fit consumption behaviours into
 assumed static social groups could - for example - be an inappropriate
 branding of certain social group as profligate or unwise 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

cite{Burger2015SAMiddleClass}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If such issues have been avoided in empirical studies, then it is only
 through direct consumer surveys of status value of items within a particular
 social context 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{heffetz_visibility}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - a crucial part of the analysis that isn't often repeated under disparate
 social contexts.
 The views from 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{VeblenLeisureClass}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 seem to have thus outlasted more recent sociological research on status
 and prevailed in empirical studies since they go hand in hand with the
 futility assumption.
 Simply put, aspirational consumption can be safely assumed to offer only
 a futile value to the consumer when social goals - as the motivator of
 status consumption - have already been assumed separate from economic concerns.
 Acknowledging the more nuanced views on social goals offered by recent
 sociological research, the presented study takes a different approach by
 relying on a broader view of aspirational consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach in the current study thus avoids limitations of both the views
 - first by concerning itself with the variation of high-quality or exclusive
 consumption without any

\end_inset

a priori

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 judgments of a generic aspirational basket of items and second, by considering
 an explicit link between economic and social goals for questions pertaining
 to effects of income inequalities on consumption (rather than adopting
 a pure-status view).
 The empirical chapters are careful to avoid any conclusions on profligate
 expenditure from consumption observed in food and education categories.
 In explaining how items of aspirational value could become a common need,
 the theoretical chapter focuses on a specific mechanism for how aspirational
 consumption may benefit the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that many of such issues with studies in conspicuous
 consumption have already been highlighted in the literature.
 The theoretical challenges to the zero-sum view of pure-status prevalent
 in empirical studies are well-substantiated in the sociology literature
 
\begin_inset ERT

 while the empirical literature has also made attempts to incorporate status
 implication of asset-possession and income-classes 
\begin_inset ERT

 Instead of assigning higher status-signaling behaviour to specific social
 groups, 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 - for example - have argued that the catch-up behaviour of less affluent
 groups in South Africa could be driven by historical asset deficits.
 The link between social and economic goals that we have argued for in the
 study fits within the attempts to incorporate such catch-up behaviours
 and aims to model the variation in segregation levels across different
 societies that may be ignored with a pure-status view.

 or race in US

\backslash

 makes a strong case for the pure-status view.
 A dynamics for status under such conditions is unlikely to exhibit any
 material change in social positions - thus allowing an empirical analysis
 to ignore mobility perceptions and focus on how social status - in a pure
 objective sense - influences consumer choices.
 Our contention in the presented study - on the other hand - has only been
 that the implications for objective notions of status may not offer a complete
 view without considering the subjective aspects of status that are difficult
 to sideline when discussing effects of status on individual decisions on
 aspirational consumption.
 While the role of race or caste is incontrovertible in their respective
 contexts, it also makes sense to reconcile the subjective notions of such
 realities when considering consumption in an environment where higher-populatio
n density has changed lifestyles, consumerism has picked up an unprecedented
 degree of momentum and newer social identities are shaping up

The goal of empirical analyses in the study has been to examine the role
 of permanent income on consumption of aspirational value - a role that
 also helps in assessing future rise in aspirational consumption given that
 high-consumption being limited to richer households limits the rise in
 such consumption.
 That the role of household income is less important for education in urbanised
 areas than for high quality food can be viewed in light of the theoretical
 findings of the first chapter on how persistent household income inequalities
 influence demand for status-goods varying in their potential mobility value.
 More specifically, the assumption of social goals being tied with economic
 goals allows us to contrast the status value of high-quality food against
 that of education while considering their future economic benefits.
 It is after all more often that one's prestigious degrees are more rewarding
 than one's fine-dining experiences - even though both may have some likelihood
 of raising the chances of gaining a wealthier social/economic position
 through social interactions.
 In terms of the theoretical model from the first chapter, the expenditure
 on education offers higher returns than high food quality for a given participa
tion cost.

Recall that the two equilibria in the long-run comprise of one where only
 the rich participate (Case I) and another where both rich and poor can
 participate (Case III).
 In case of a binding constraint when the poor are not in a position to
 participate, only the rich participate with their expenditures increasing
 with wider income differences.
 This seems aligned with the case for education in the poorer economy (Tanzania)
 as well as for high-quality food where participation costs (for a given
 return) seem beyond the means of the poor.
 With increased urbanisation, on the other hand, both the role of social
 capital becomes higher and the participation of poor increases due to lowered
 participation costs - resulting in an equilibrium where both rich and poor
 participate (Case III).
 The relation with inequality remains the same nevertheless in both types
 of equilibria so that high inequalities may be maintained with high enough
 participation costs.
 The increased income differences thus contribute to rise in expenditures
 in the latter case as well when lower participation costs allow both the
 rich and poor to participate.
 This seems aligned with empirical results for education expenditure in
 the urbanised regions of Nigeria.

We have argued that views on how inequality influences status consumption
 that focus primarily on notions of visibility may ignore the variation
 in mobility appeal from disparate status items.
 As the most primal necessity, food is a likely consumption category to
 exhibit significant quality differences in consumer markets.
 While a higher quality of food may help let a rich consumer in SSA distinguish
 herself from the poorer consumer (as is evidenced by sociological surveys),
 such quality competes with other newer consumption categories for signal-indica
tion through consumption.
 With much fewer population in Tanzania having had education and a much
 higher population having had education in Nigeria - it is not unlikely
 that education has a stronger bandwagon effect than food.
 But what a focus on the visible appeal from the newer consumption types
 - electronics, cosmetic products, fashionable items etc.
 - may fail to highlight is that consumer motivations towards social capital
 investments - expenditures such as elite sports, social activities, education
 etc.
 - may offer perceptions of future economic benefits to the consumer as
 well as a status value that neither food nor new fashion might.
 What the study argues is that such needs - which are also of aspirational
 value - can neither be considered basic needs of the consumer nor can they
 be explained by the dichotomy of private-public utility used in the visible
 consumption models.
 The dual purpose of this important element of aspirational consumption
 - of indicating a status superiority while also increasing higher expected
 future wealth - may be better understood in an expected value framework
 where status gains are plausibly linked with economic gains for the consumer.
