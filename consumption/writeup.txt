1. For TNZ, nominal prices were adjusted according to Fisher index.
2. Own production can be significant (we're comparing different markets)
3. Sections
4. Section K (assigned)
4.1 Section K details food consumption (K1 has most relevant data)
4.1.1. hh_k01_2 -> did they eat within the HH
4.1.2. hh_k02_02 -> how much they eat (if 4.1.1 is true)
4.1.3. hh_k03_02 -> how much from last 7 days
4.1.4. hh_k04    -> how much spent
4.1.5. hh_k05_2  -> how much came from own production
4.1.6. hh_k06_2  -> how much came from gifts
4.1.7.1. The formula for bought items is : 
    hh_k04>0
4.1.7.2. The questions that arise are whether it's OK to ignore the out-of-HH consumption (in a household we consider only when there are purchases being made - this is largely to unniform the data between UK and TNZ). 
3.2. Section N talks about assets owned (meaning that assets are not bought as much)

3.3. Section E talks about income(labour) (disguised unemployment) (assigned)
3.3.1. Q04 - hh_e04 - checks if there was any work done in past 7 days
3.3.2. Q6  - determines type of employment - interested in {"on farm","paid employee","self employed non-agr" (with or without employees)} Q8 - Yes if available to work. About 6000/29054 do NOT work.
3.3.2.1. Q6 determines the number - Q22 - contains the amount paid ( If it is a farm, then only 3% farm workers are paid ). Only 14% are actually paid.
These are cases of contractual obligations. Most likely people are going hungry because they just don't have a way to buy food (it is not as if they are unpaid - they actually don't work) - ~100 of them have secondary jobs.
3.3.2.2. Q35 and Q38 are concerned with secondary jobs - they don't generate a lot of instances of secondary jobs (we should add them up for our analysis - assigned)
3.3.3. Q51 and Q65 are relevant for self-employments

3.3.3.1. Q51 checks for self-employment (1785/20559) are self-employed (hh_e51=='Yes') in past week - 537 have worked in past 12 months if not in last week (i.e. hh_e52=='Yes' & hh_e51 == 'No'). 

Q65 - net income last week/month from the business (self-employment)

2246/20559 have positive net incomes.

3.3.3.2. 74 asks for unpaid help. Only 824 workers helped without getting paid. 


3.4. Section F talks about food outside the HH (assigned) - need to be considered if this is a significant number. Only 5% seem to have eaten a meal outside the household (for them the value of the outside consumption - i.e. hh_f03 - wasn't that high - TBA)

3.5. Section G has subjective welfare (permanent income)
3.6. Section I has food security concerns (borrowed food etc.)
3.7. Section L (Section M - annually) - describes non-food expenditure 

4. Purchase vs consumption is a key concern
5. The comparison with visible consumption wasn't done. It turns out that for LSMS-TNZ, section M records some data that could imply visible consumption. Section N records data that households own.

6. In a more socially connected society - where people may eat at other people's home, nuts or raisins may become part of visible consumption. Whether this choice is valid or not requires the sort of visible index which Heffetz builds. Without that our analysis relies on usual aggregation.

7. Any claims on budget share requires coverage i.e. the claim that all expenditure is recorded in the survey.


If, for example, name dropping the names of schools attended by oneâ€™s children early in every conversation is a common social practice (and assuming that people rarely lie about such things), then expenditures on school education might be fairly visible. In other words, the visibility we wish to measure is a sociocultural rather than physical feature of commodities, determined by the sociocultural context in which they are consumed (Heffetz: Test of Conspicuous Consumption).
