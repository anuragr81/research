\begin_layout Subsection
Quality of Consumption in the developing countries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demand studies in the developing world often work with data that is much
 sparser and has overall less details on the individual households.
 Current surveys mitigate many such issues - but the problems that arise
 out of non-uniform institutions themselves make the standardisation of
 data across the developing countries rather challenging.
 Studies of consumption of quality in the developing countries have therefore
 often limited themselves to food where the measurement of quality is independen
t of consumed brand or type - details that are often not recorded in a typical
 consumer survey.
 Since a significant chunk of income is spent on food for most of the population
 in the developing countries, the variation in quality in food gives us
 a good picture of quality substitution.
 Still, problems like segmentation of price - due the lack of a cheap transport
 infrastructure and a large enough firm size - makes the analysis of quality
 particularly prone to error.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current study, we attempt to quantify the choice of quality in the
 developing world.
 Instead of focusing on food quality alone, we also observe the effect of
 vast differences in life-style that living in urban vs rural areas would
 bring to the consumer in a developing country.
 The sheer lack of availability of certain goods in the rural areas - we
 believe - should also be noted in the consumption of quality.
 We comment on how overall quality may vary with economic inequalities across
 multiple economies as the consumer spreads the expenditure on quality across
 the commodity groups (food, energy etc.).
 This may provide us a better understanding of how quality of consumption
 changes in response to vast economic changes such as urban developments
 or market centralisation.
 This could be of interest both from a general demand analysis perspective
 and from a more specific conspicuous consumption perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To observe quality of consumption with respect to income inequalities across
 the developing countries, we motivate a model for substitution between
 a consumer's long-term needs that are fulfilled with ownership of assets
 or improvement of the socio-economic standing and the consumer's short-term
 needs that are fulfilled with improved quality of consumption.
 The socio-economic standing of the consumer is determined by an order of
 what we identify as the parameters for status (income, education, occupation)
 as well as a history of quality of consumption.
 These parameters do not all have the same effect on the long-term socio-economi
c standing of the consumer.
 The improvement in quality of expenditure is measured with the expensive
 non-durable consumption (ENDC).
 We surmise that the distribution of quality across the consumption groups
 (food, energy, housing etc.) should be affected by the long-term needs of
 (asset accumulation, educational needs etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that we differentiate between quality consumption
 and conspicuous consumption.
 At least semantically speaking, the term conspicuous consumption encompasses
 only the exclusive consumption by the rich.
 In an environment of severe economic inequalities, the options for conspicuous
 consumption are in fact further limited to an even smaller part of the
 population.
 On the other hand, a comparison of high quality consumption in the different
 groups of a typical demand survey covers the quality concerns for a larger
 section of the population and views status needs of the consumer as part
 of her long-term utility.
 Even for a study for status consumption alone, the extension of the sense
 of status-consumption to all commodity groups and all consumers would be
 necessary to understand the underlying factors that contribute to status
 in the developing world.
 In Tanzania for example - which we explore in the study - one may be tempted
 to argue - based on the literature on conspicuous consumption - that buying
 clothes indicates higher status.
 But without observing the effect that getting electricity in the house
 or moving to a bigger house may have on a consumer's status, we cannot
 accurately explain the household consumption on status - since the possibility
 that those spending on electricity or housing may actually be cutting down
 on clothing expenditure while deriving status from electricity or house
 ownership cannot be ruled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard diary and recall methods in a typical survey measure neither
 the quality of consumption nor the socio-economic standing of the consumer
 - the measurement of both of which is central to our goals in the study.
 The measurement of quality is relatively easy - as we rely on the availability
 of price information to classify high-quality (expensive) items apart from
 their cheaper substitutes.
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data therefore, eggs and milk are deemed of lower
 quality than goat and beef for proteins.
 For transport, similarly gasoline-for-car is deemed of lower quality than
 public transport an so on.
 Except for some items that would be missing in the developing country when
 comparing the consumption between two countries, this is a relatively easy
 task.
 For measuring the socio-economic standing of a consumer

The terms social capital or status capital are also used in the literature
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, we rely on the measure of socio-economic-status (SES) - which is a standard
 measure of the socio-economic status often used in the sociological and
 health studies.
 The long-term utility of the consumer in the model thus consists of a vector
 of income, education and region/locality/neighborhood.
 In addition, we also include the ownership of durable goods (defined as
 items to be purchased with an intent of long-term ownership) and a history
 of ENDC in the measures for status.
 This is of key importance since income, education, occupation or residence
 are usually fixed in the short-run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accumulation of durable goods serves as one of the indicators of stability
 of high income - as we expect individuals to purchase these durable goods
 (more expensive than quality consumption) only if their expectation of
 stability of income is high (higher than it is compared to when they engage
 in higher quality non-durable consumption).
 To compare the accumulation of long-term durable goods (LTDG) in a developed
 and a developing economy, we order the LTDG in the market based on their
 cost of acquisition.
 The differences in the costs of the two successive assets in this cost-order
 for LTDG present the substitutability between asset acquisition and quality
 consumption.
 A higher difference between two successive LTDG costs would make the consumptio
n of quality more tempting for a consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the developing world, not only are the markets underdeveloped for making
 rental options available for the the expensive durable goods (LTDG), there
 is somewhat of an absence of credit facilities - both of which make the
 difference between successive LTDG costs higher than in the developed countries
 (where markets are more developed and either credit to purchase LTDG or
 direct rental of LTDG is made available to consumer).
 To explain the effect of economic inequality on quality consumption in
 the developing vs the developed countries, we can thus compare the expensive
 non-durable consumption along with the differences between the current
 and next point of LTDG acquisition in the cost curve of LTDG for any two
 selected countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
LITERATURE SURVEY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to test - even with a simple model for quality and possession
 of assets - whether prolonged measures of income equality (and therefore
 stagnant ownership of durable goods) can influence non-durable consumption
 asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes (a problem that may
 be relevant for countries in Africa).
 In a study of conspicuous consumption, Friehe et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 compare the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption in the regions of erstwhile East and West Germany and study
 the effects of the respective stagnant and well-performing states of their
 past economies on status consumption in the unified economy.
 If macroeconomic factors and issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) can be controlled for
 in the economies, then a model for long-term needs can explain the demand
 pressures induced by economic inequalities across the different economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of data on quality in most consumer surveys however often results
 in the selection of models where a rational consumer - knowing all about
 her future plans - is in fact not expected to engage in any long-term status
 related consumption at all.
 As Thaler et al had argued in their influential paper on a behavioural
 life-cycle hypothesis, there should be no overeating and overspending if
 the consumers were rational (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

).
 If there is indeed nothing to be gained by status-related consumption (i.e.
 conspicuous consumption is essentially futile - as argued by Veblen), then
 there is no way for the rational consumer to derive any utility from status-rel
ated consumption.
 However, the mere existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there
 is some utility to be derived by spending on status or quality.

Ireland model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - using a visibility factor - argue that the perception of one's income

 As long as conspicuous consumption exists - one can argue that the visibility
 factor in Ireland model ought to be non-zero and the consumers would

 visible utility by observing consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a visibility factor based model has its merits, we find the assumption
 of status being derived from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

futile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items too strong for empirical purposes in a more general study of inequalities
 and quality in the developed and the developing economies (see Ustuner
 et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 for difficulties in extending the literature on conspicuous consumption
 in the developed countries on to the developing world).
 The futility assumption makes less sense in the developing world 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 where there are far fewer exclusive conspicuous items and the expenditure
 on conspicuous items is limited to a much smaller portion of the population.
 The empirical classification of status-items in the developed world itself
 based on visibility is also fraught with problems (escaped only through
 a consumer survey of one's own) - as an item both provides advantages through
 visibility and through quality.
 Instead of deciding on a crisp boundary between visible and non-visible
 utilities, we focus on the quality defined as expensive non-durable consumption
 (which prices status or visible benefits and signals elitism) and ownership
 of durable goods (which signals that it'll take longer for others to acquire
 a particular costly item).
 Both ENDC and LTDG contribute to the long-term utility that the consumers
 optimise over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our focus on quality criteria for long-term utility rather than on visibility
 is not intended to diminish the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption but only to include the latter in a wider model for status
 and income.
 Visibility does contribute to status and therefore the long-term utility
 of the consumer - but one also needs to related it with the underlying
 economic variables that may drive status (or utility) in the long-run.
 By means of an analogy, let's consider the market for cars where status
 is signalled through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption might tell us that the consumers
 pay more attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would like to see primarily - i) the constraints on
 occupation and income that exist in the respective areas and ii)) the price
 differences in the cars being sold in the market.
 In our original problem of status consumption, while it is true that individual
s spend more on their outward appearances (despite controlling for everything
 else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not all what status
 consumption may comprise of (see the Figure and Eastman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Eastman1999"

\end_inset

 for the terminology around status consumption).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we detail in the later sections, visibility can be viewed in relation
 to the consumer's preference order of commodity groups for quality.
 In the different separable commodity groups we identify for consumption,
 we assume that the consumer adjusts quality based on a preference order
 over the commodity groups - e.g.
 a consumer may consider quality for transport more important than quality
 in food (or vice versa).
 However, such an order in the model matters amidst two items only if they
 are in different commodity groups.
 For the items within the group, such a preference doesn't exist in the
 model.
 For example, in the Tanzanian LSMS data where we identify six categories
 - Food, Energy, Transport, Personal Care, Social Functions and Housing/Land,
 visibility may not have much of a role to play within each of the commodity
 groups even though the consumers may consider the quality in one group
 more important than in the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model of the status-cognisant long-term utility considering
 LTDG and ENDC does not view status consumption as futile.
 Instead it relates the quality of non-durable consumption and the ownership
 of long-term durable goods with the perceptions of social mobility.
 Unlike in many studies for status consumption, we assume that the only
 advantage status consumption may offer to a rational consumer would be
 through a promise (or a belief) of social mobility.
 This relationship between consumption and social mobility itself is an
 idea that dates back least as far back as Adam Smith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmithMoralSentiments"

\end_inset

 and has been re-evaluated by modern economists in the recent decades

\begin_layout Standard
The literature on myopic behaviour (see Muellbauer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."

\end_inset

) and behavioural economics also points out the inertia of choices or persistenc
e of habits.
 As the consumer forms expectations of status promotion through improvement
 of accumulated goods and habits of sustained high-quality consumption,
 we compare the two types of consumption in two selected economies (see
 Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 and Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990"

\end_inset

 - where the case for a ranking order of status is motivated).
 From the point of view of conspicuous consumption, such a comparison helps
 us quantify which of the two economies has more reliance on short-term
 needs vs long-term needs for status consumption.
 From a more general demand analysis perspective, such a comparison tells
 us about the effect of supply issues and inequalities on quality.
 In a further substantiation of the model under an intertemporal substitution
 setting in a subsequent chapter, we include the probabilities of ownership
 of LTDG in the expectation of status promotion to arrive at a life-cycle
 formulation of the model for long-term needs vs quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another advantage of the LTDG and ENDC based model for long-term utility
 is that it can help deconstruct the role of social identity as a vehicle
 of status.
 While identities have been deemed quite important for status in the many
 studies on conspicuous consumption we have surveyed (see Chao et al.

 and Khamis et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), we believe that the difference in LTDG owned by the identities over time
 should be factored in to explain how identities carry status across the
 different countries.
 In terms of the model, an identity (religious, racial etc.) carries status
 only thro gh a history of past LTDG ownership, incomes/occupations and
 persistent-high quality consumption - a criterion that may allow us to
 quantify the role of identity in status.

\begin_layout Standard
The econometric methods corresponding to the indirect utility can be easily
 devised if one assumes that the consumer observes the price index of an
 item whose many variants exist in the market.
 However since a better quality item is set to be more expensive than the
 less quality item, a switch to higher quality by the consumer is inseparable
 in the model from an increase in the price-index of the item whose multiple
 variants exist in the market.
 The increase in the price-index of an item (regardless of whether it's
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shift -so that the relative price structure of the variants remains the
 same or not) only implies the consumer would reduce the quantity consumed
 of the item.
 We may still use the model if we assume that the individual's quality preferenc
es are fixed - but a change in quality due to price cannot be studied with
 the model as such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the usual limitations of an additive utility function such as Stone
 Geary indeed also apply.
 But our intention is only to point out that an explicit measure of quality
 is necessary in the either the direct utility or the cost-function for
 us to interpret meaningful results for quality using the corresponding
 econometric method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution of quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the model is to measure the distribution of the quality of consumpti
on and the ownership of assets throughout the population.
 The items of high-quality can exist in every category and they are not
 assumed be equivalent or substitutable (kobe beef cannot be substituted
 with a luxury travel as is).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
, we do not assume the a category of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high-quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or status items exist either.
 Instead, a consumer puts some weight on the high-quality in each category
 ( i.e.
 the portion of total expenditure spent on the expensive non-durable consumption
) based on her taste and prices of quality in every category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expensive nondurable consumption (ENDC) weights contributes to status
 only if its is sustained at high level - except for which the long-term
 utility is influenced by asset purchases and the occupation-education-region
 vector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we consider an environment of stable prices i.e.
 if the effect of price changes is ignored, the distribution of ENDC weights
 may change when the individuals acquire assets and spend on upkeep and
 maintenance costs for assets or as they give up on hopes of acquiring costlier
 assets (possibly due to other needs).
 It is assumed that a consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality
 (there is little evidence of that in the data) - therefore when prices
 are stable a rise in expensive nondurable consumption must come either
 from an increase in income or from depletion of savings (sale of assets).
 Likewise, a drop in expensive non-durable consumption must be due to purchase
 of assets, addressing of more urgent needs or a drop in income (when price
 are stable).
 All rational consumers in our model hope to increase their social status
 through consumption as they increase their utility in their lifetime.
 Therefore either asset ownership or quality consumption is attempted at
 all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this environment of stable prices, the consumption is influenced by long-term
 expectations - which is measured in the model as a vector of occupation,
 education, region (locality, neighborhood) and assets.
 Since income, occupation and education are fixed in the short-run, what
 changes most often is the acquisition of assets that are available in the
 market if the needs of the consumer haven't changed.
 Whenever assets are purchased, the consumer must undergo a change in the
 weight of the quality in the consumption categories if i) her needs (including
 status needs) haven't changed (status can only be indicated through asset
 ownership or quality) ii) if she is not saving for another asset (the consumer
 is more likely to spend on quality if she doesn't have more assets planned
 to purchase in the future) .
 We assume that except for the change brought about by assets or needs,
 a consumer does not change her taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we now look at the effect of price changes, then we must consider the
 price of quality.
 There is no price index for quality that may exist for the consumer and
 the quality in one category may be substituted with quality in another.
 Thus if quality is measured in a simple-repackaging manner (i.e.
 in terms of units of the cheaper good), then quality in food may be cheaper
 than quality in transport or vice versa.
 The relative advantage this substitution brings to status is how a consumer's
 choice may be governed by status needs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate this substitution with an example, consider a middle-income
 family that cuts down on expenses (due to loss of income) by moving to
 a cheaper area where the rents are lower but the restaurants are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place - so the consumption would either
 shift to saving for a better car (asset) or improve quality in some other
 category (better jewelry, better schooling for kids etc.) - assuming the
 needs of the family haven't changed (including the status needs).
 The difference between needs and status-needs is not a concern for this
 model - as it only observes the differences between high-price and low-price
 consumption in the same category and assumes that the essential needs are
 independent of the wealth of the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example, the needs for the family can be proxied with the number
 of family members.
 In general there is no difference in needs for rich and the poor consumer
 in the model.
 Hence the difference between the status of a rich and a poor family is
 not through disparate educational needs of the rich and poor children but
 instead through a more general need for the family to maintain status across
 all categories.
 The aggregate sense of status is derived by expensive non-durable consumption
 and asset possession in all categories - that are driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class needs of the
 consumer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
–
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A tree: a consumer has already fixed the proportion of expenditure on every
 category (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},...,\lambda_{c}...,)$
\end_inset

 ) - depending on her assets possession and long-term needs.
 The complementarity or supplementarity between the item categories for
 quality consumption does not change - and the relationship between any
 two items in any two different categories changes only as response to the
 total expenditure (i.e response to price changes and total expenditure changes
 must use the same channels of communication in the commodity tree).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature on quality often uses a two-state budgeting approach - which
 cannot be used for long-term status needs as status is derived from across
 the item categories.
 To illustrate the two-state budgeting approach with a more concrete example,
 let's consider a two-category world of food and energy so that within food
 and energy we have items beef-bread-milk and electricity-kerosene-charcoal
 respectively.
 Without status, the items - food and energy - can be assumed (and tested
 empirically) to be separable groups as it is plausible for a consumer to
 allocate some money 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy respectively in the first-stage (based on her knowledge
 of the price-indices for food and energy).
 Once the expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 are fixed, the consumer can subsequently decide in the second-state how
 much of kerosene or electricity to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and how much beef or bread to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Individual prices of every item within the category would decide which
 food varieties and which energy sources are to be purchased.
 Under the conditions of weak separability, is is implied that cheaper bread
 (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose
 a more expensive fuel (price-sensitivity for electricity, charcoal etc.)
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

 for details on the theory).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This assumption can indeed fall apart if we introduce status - if we assume
 that a consumer gets status from using electricity and from eating kobe
 beef interchangeably, then having decided on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 does not guarantee that she would not switch to more consumption on electricity
 if kobe beef becomes cheaper.
 This is because status is aggregated from across the commodities.
 Thus unlike in the case of energy and food without status, cheaper food
 can be compensated with the switch to electricity.
 If price sensitivities and total expenditure sensitivities don't follow
 the same channel of communication in the two-state budgeting tree - then
 the necessary condition for two-stage separability is not met (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Faced with reducing quality and reducing quantity - clearly one cannot be
 myopic about quality.
 In other words, faced with a choice of needs, one would reduce the quality
 immediately.
 Needs of energy are more important than consuming electricity.
 Myopia means that electricity quantity and beef quantity would move slowly
 and the quantity of bread and kerosene is more likely to be adusted rather
 than the quantity.
 Whether changed prices result in more burning of kerosene can only be verified
 with a discrete model.
 This is the MacFadden approach that would be taken later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a consumer can change status between commodities then we cannot have
 a repackaging approach - which assumes perfect substitutability between
 the items in the category.
 
\end_layout

More formally, let's consider the prices

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{2}^{1}$

 be the prices of the cheapest commodity - which can be considered a base-price.
 The base-price should be such that we can view the choice of

 in terms of the base-price

 ought to stay the same while

 would increase due to rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 goes down.
 It is possible that the consumer would spend less on food overall to support
 her energy needs.
 The other possibility is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 stays the same while 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 goes down proportionately.

\begin_layout Standard
To specify the status utility - which depends on both on expensive non-durable
 consumption (ENDC) and possession of assets (POA)) status.
 , status doesn't require quality consumption to matter over the long-run.
 Quality consumption can indicate the net asset worth and the expectations
 for future social mobility - but it is only observed as the inertia in
 the selection of weights for quality in every category - without influencing
 status directly.
 A consumer sets her weight on status quality based on her perception of
 status - but the real changes to status are brought about only through
 assets (which are one of the factors of change in weights - by definition)
\begin_inset Foot

Note that weights on quality is not a category - and every weight on quality
 is different from weight in every category.

 Whether the consumer actually achieves the planned goals for asset purchase
 over or not is an issue we deal with in a later empirical analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
–
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we identify the six categories in the data from consumption survey,
 we also recognise that quality variation doesn't always exist in the market
 for every category.
 For example, in Tanzania - the car rental market seems small and the variation
 in the quality of cars being sold may be smaller than in a typical city
 in the developed world.
 When quality variation is not observed, only the relevant assets in a category
 can bring status.
 If status needs are fixed over short-term, then the unavailability of the
 quality variation in the category would either increase the savings for
 the next available asset in the category or increase the quality consumption
 in some other category (assuming status needs remain the same).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two key assumptions in the model.
 First, for simplicity, we assume that every category (food, energy, housing
 etc.) is dominated by assets or by nondurable consumption.
 Second, it that purchasing assets is always more expensive than the engaging
 in the higher quality non-durable consumption.
 The second assumption gets around the issue that we effectively ignore
 the quality differences in assets when assuming high-quality non-durable
 consumption dominates in a category.
 Empirically, this assumption is not as problematic - since there are no
 assets in the food category (or energy) that could matter for status while
 the quality consumption in housing is made irrelevant by high (relative)
 price of housing.
 This is not to say that a model with quality variation amongst assets is
 not possible (a consumer can choose between types of housing for example).
 Thus the first assumption would need to be relieved if quality-variation
 in assets was to be considered.
 As a result of this assumption, the asset purchase has a more immediate
 impact on the status than a sudden increase in quality in the mode.
 High-quality consumption and purchase of assets thus reflect the short-term
 and long-term status needs of the consumer respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a cross-sectional analysis, 
\begin_inset Formula $w$

 of expensive category is enough for this analysis.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two competing approaches used for quality in the literature that
 we find relevant to our work.
 First is the simple-repackaging approach, which views a high-quality item
 as extra units of the low-quality product for the same price - or equivalently
 the same units for a lower quality-adjusted price.
 The other approach is the model of discrete choice for utility - which
 separates the stochastic and non-stochastic components of utility obtained
 after choosing the different items.
 We focus on the first approach in the cross-sectional analysis in the current
 chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple repackaging model does the above analysis with a quality function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{c}(u,p_{1},p_{2},...,\theta)=c(u,\frac{p_{1}}{h(\theta)},p_{2},...,1)$
\end_inset

 .
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is a function of quality.
 For us to use this form, we must be sure of the quality of the item.
 For food, we can just take the total quantity of the item in the group
 - a simple addition - not one based on calories would suffice.
 The quality measure is then the ratio of higher price quantities to the
 total quantities.
 It feels that the discrete model would represent the choice better - because
 the quality characteristics are not known for most items.
 The simple repackaging approach seems to compare characteristics such accelerat
ion, roominess etc.
 in the models for cars.
 We'll have to classify our items based on such characteristics as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that quality is of significance only in food and energy.
 Personal care, housing doesn't have so much of quality consumption - as
 having a house is more important.
 We don't look for quality consumed in housing or personal care.
 We record only that a person owns a medium or a high-asse.
 We do not observe the effect of price of assets.
 Still, it is possible to observe the discrete differences in quality based
 on the overall price of houses in 2012.
 A comparison with IES data - however isn't possible with respect to assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A cross-sectional analysis can tell us what effect having assets may have
 on quality consumption.
 As we have not quantitatively specified the substitution between asset
 and quality in a more explicit model, we have no way of using asset ownership
 on in a time-series model.
 For the quality variation alone, it is possible to observe consumption
 quality moves with price if we include the price of food and price of electrici
ty in a simple repackaging approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use price dummies to check if the consumer is in a high price region.
 Within nondurable consumption, anything other than needs (controlled through
 region, household size and income) is expensive consumption.
 Expensiveness of nondurable expenditure is only found by availability of
 a cheaper substitute.

DATA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at the consumption in Tanzania and compare it with South Africa
 - which may be more socially unequal but is an overall less poor country.
 A country like Tanzania is likely to have more economic inequality and
 less development of common services compared to South Africa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Descriptive statistics on the Tanzanian data are then presented.
 We focus on food expenditure - which is recorded with a greater level of
 detail than other expenditures.
 As market prices are recorded for food items, we check how the higher budget
 shares are associated with choice of higher price items.
 We find that the consumption of highest prices items doesn't always result
 in higher budget shares.
 Tea and coffee don't form the highest budget shares (while they are expensive).
 Items that are of high price and have low budget shares while having cheaper
 substitutes in the market qualify for the expensive non-durable consumption
 criteria for quality.
 Other descriptive statistics measure, e.g.
 the skewnesss of total expenditure on the item can also hint whether only
 a small proportion of population gets to spend more on the item.
 Noticeably, the budget share on skin-cream etc.
 - which we may have normally associated with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption - is quite low.
 The variance on the consumption of skin-cream is in fact lower than that
 for bread or milk.
 The budget shares for cigarettes seem quite high (and quite skewed) - however,
 since there are no cheaper substitutes available we don't consider cigarettes
 as part of status consumption.
 Although the descriptive statistics seem to confirm the heuristic that
 amongst many substitutable items, the distribution of expensive varieties
 is more likely to be skewed, it is worth emphasising that neither skewness
 nor mean-cost is used as a criteria to pick items for status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simple repackaging model requires that the quality variants of an item
 are perfect substitutes.
 We therefore make sure that the variants of an item in a group are near-perfect
 substitutes.
 In food, we put goat and meat in the same group - but not tea and coffee
 - because there is little sense in substitution between tea/coffee and
 goat/meat.
 The food category is in fact divided into sub-categories so that demands
 within the category can be considered separable but still lump together
 the substitutes that are of value for quality.
 Instead of having to put tea,coffee with goat,beef in high-price food categorie
s for quality, we consider put consider the high quality consumption in
 the sub-categories beverages and protein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of classifying beef, pork and goat as varieties of meat, we group
 them together with milk products, lentils and eggs as sources of protein
 - since we view the latter as cheaper sources of protein.
 For similar reasons, when analysing holiday expenses in South African data
 (IES), we don't distinguish between expensive holidays and cheaper holidays
 - but count the expenditure on holidays as expensive non-durable consumption
 under entertainment/personal-care.
 The grouping of items is intended to achieve both separability and substitution
 for the simple repackaging model in mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many instances, one would find that the consumption items in the developed
 world have no equivalent in the developing country.
 For example, while comparing the Tanzanian data with the South African
 survey (IES), we do not find holiday expenses and car rental in the Tanzanian
 LSMS survey.
 In such cases, there is not much to be gained by sub-dividing the categories.
 Absence of sub-categories of consumption seems to provide a limit on granularit
y of the grouping of items.
 The absence of a sub-category counts as zero consumption in the parent
 category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We refrain from using detailed price of assets purchased (available in the
 Tanzanian data for 2012) - since recording of assets is different in SA
 IES and TNZ LSMS surveys.
 More particularly, the expenditure on furniture and other assets is a diary
 expenditure in the SA IES data while the assets are recorded separately
 as a recall in the Tanzanian LSMS.
 As far as possible, we avoid mixing results from recall and diary methods
 elsewhere as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recall method is particularly volatile in developing countries where
 regular payment setups are hardly a norm.
 We must be careful therefore with interpreting differences in the budget
 share over snapshots (2008,2010 and 2012) for a particular household -
 as the household may not have expenditures in all three instances of the
 survey.
 For cases such as electricity in Tanzania, we find the survey field for
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main lighting fuel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 more reliable for the test of electricity consumption than the last expenditure
 on electricity (note that kerosene is much cheaper than electricity in
 Tanzania).
 Such matters can be made worse in cases of expenditure where seasonality
 (time of the year) is also an important factor.
 To address the issue, therefore, we are careful not to draw any conclusions
 from a household's expenditure over the time-series (i.e.
 survey snapshots in 2008, 2010 and 2012) - but rely on the average expenditure
 by a collection of households (in a particular region etc.) over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We don't make any comparison of ethnicity or social identity data between
 the two countries.
 Given the different make-up of the two countries, the data for ethnicity
 is not comparable - SA IES records race while the Tanzania LSMS records
 religion and native-language.
 The social identity data is only used for studying segmentation of demand
 within each economy.

RESULTS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preliminary analysis is presented first without the simple repackaging
 formulation and then with the simple repackaging formulation.
 We use the constrained regression to ensure the conditions of adding-up
 are met.
 The effect of assets is only modelled as a dummy variable (low-price, medium-pr
ice and high-price assets).
 The results from a differences-model and quantile regression are also presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the second part of econometric analysis is to see how long-term
 status needs of the consumers - fulfilled with purchase of assets (which
 translates into an upward movement in status in our model) relate with
 the short-term needs fulfilled with expensive non-durable consumption.
 Much the way we were wary of claiming that consumption on items indicates
 perception of status hierarchies, we don't claim that the observed social
 mobility - recorded in this way - serves as a measure of how status is
 perceived in society.
 The variation in the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC) across occupation
 ranks, education, social identities and the assets owned across the two
 countries (see quantile regression results) only tells how quality consumption
 segmented in the two economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the model doesn't require that a consumer purchase a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

composite item
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of quality (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities"

\end_inset

).
 Instead, we believe that quality is a concern for the researcher and not
 for the consumer - who merely exercises her choice given the set of products
 available in the market for given prices (see the clarification from Nelson
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

).
 Since status would always be priced in the market, a status item would
 be always more expensive than the rest of the items which provide the same
 functionality (see Chao et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chao1998"

\end_inset

 for substantiation of this argument).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that medium assets seem limited to the cities - and the
 households in the rural areas miss out on ownership of these assets.
 There are less opportunities for expensive non-durable consumption in the
 rural parts of Tanzania - except for marriage - where the expenditure seems
 proportionally high.
 The differences in the life-styles (quality consumption) between rural
 and urban areas in the developing countries results in less dependence
 on assets.
 Status is more likely to be derived from what is available as assets in
 the rural areas - compared to a more advanced economy such as that of South
 Africa.

The definition of status is hard to pin down when discussing status consumption.
 If one believes that social mobility exists and that one economy could

 from visible consumption) becomes sensitive to how status is perceived
 differently across countries.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Veblen's literature itself dates from a time when rapid economic developments
 took place in the United States - transitioning from a largely agrarian
 society to an industrialised one.
 The relevance of status through purchasing good is tied with industrial
 development.
 Less industrial development would mean less nondurable consumption - but
 not necessarily perceived differences in society.
 Any measure of how much status differences exist in the society - or if
 one - is not possible with consumption alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that it's the relevance of identity to status that should address
 such differences - as well as social status.
 We argue that over the long-term it is the status.
 Identity can matter but only as long as it has been associated with assets
 in the past.
 We cannot understand identity without a long-term effect.
 However, a cross-section analysis can detect the influence of identity
 on accumulation of assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visible consumption must also include visible assets too (if not education
 and occupation) - i.e.
 consumption that may be inherited or not consumed weekly (assets such as
 housing or automobiles that are not bought as frequently).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is difficult to say explicitly that the status is influence by nonudrable
 consumption.
 It might actually make sense that nondurable consumption is used to compensate
 for not having as much as assets as those who have have a perceived higher
 status (determined by assets, occupation and education).
 If non-durable consumption is correlated with social mobility (i.e.
 purchase of assets or an upward movement in education and occupation for
 a member of the household), the corresponding non-durable consumption matters
 less to the household - whereas those who don't see any changes in long-term
 possession of assets or changes in occupation-rank or education levels,
 would have no other means achieve status other than through the non-durable

The developments of the last century in Africa and Asia - bear some similarity

 In both Asia and Africa, a new working class has clashed with and replaced
 the feudal or colonial systems of the century before.
 The growing competitions for status amongst the nascent working classes
 have been a subject of sociological study in the late 20th century.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, this competition was termed as Sanskritizat
ion when erstwhile lower classes emulated higher social classes with newly
 acquired economic freedoms

 One could argue that more spending on a conspicuous item would benefit
 the society as a whole - since the money obtained from the rich on the
 item could potentially fund employment and other opportunities.
 Electricity in Africa, for example, would be a model item for this purpose
 - an item whose consumption can drive the expansion of power plants and
 make electricity cheaper for everyone.
 More spending on signaling goods does not appear to be a social waste from
 this perspective.
 However, we note that not all marketable goods are as desirable as electricity
 and there may be goals more desirable than what the exchange between rich
 and poor can provide.

 In the developing world, on the other hand, the basic needs for the masses
 have still not been addressed.
 One could expect the exchange between rich and poor to draw the masses
 out of poverty - but we argue that there are limits to how much success
 can be achieved in the developing countries - the essential goods often
 lack robust markets in the developing countries and since marketable goods
 often create needs on their own, the development of market for conspicuous
 goods may prevent the status competitions from achieving the goals of social
 welfare.
 More so in the context of conspicuous consumption than elsewhere, an commodity
 exclusively available to the richer sections of the society can easily
 become a status good and thus the possibility of a social waste due to
 spending on status goods cannot be ruled out.

We only consider district level residence and primary spoken language as
 the demographic factors that may affect status consumption.
 Amongst all the factors that one may find relevant for status in a society,

Let's take example of the availability of electricity in Tanzania.
 If only the rich could afford electricity, then it being used by a smaller
 and richer part of the population may seem to have less significance than
 weddings - which are ubiquitous in the population (a regression with quantities
 consumed as dependent variable would bear more significance for items consumed
 by more consumers).
 One may be tempted to argue that items consumed by more people carry more
 significance for status than the item that is hardly accessible to the
 wider population, but status in a society is driven by both the supply
 of the item and the ability of the individual to purchase the item (disposable
 income).
 The interplay of supply, wealth and assets determine status in a society
 and thus belonging to a region or a social network where an asset is available
 asymmetrically, would also drive status.

 The small-scale private enterprise - which forms the majority of non-agrarian

 model - which expects the prices of food to rise as labour moves from agricultu

 In our view, the flight to urban areas is not merely an escape from despondent
 circumstances but also the access to an expanded consumption basket and
 a chance for improbable social mobilities.
 The introduction of industrial goods and the status needs of the consumers
 is therefore relevant to the trend of urban migration in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The observation that the indigenes have recently displaced non-indigenes
 or the more educated have replaced the less educated in conventional occupation
s in many sub-Saharan African countries for example, may very well have
 a detectable impact on status consumption.

While the data on social identity was not available for this study, we have
 used population density to proxy some of the effects of migration.
 We observe that the population density bears significance with consumption
 of items relevant for status.
 If similar products were available in both rural and urban areas, one may
 expect that the more communication between individuals that may potentially
 intensify the bandwagon effects and status competitions.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Time Series
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over a longer period of time, an individual spreads her expenditure across
 future expectations for a status upgrade for her family and her more immediate
 needs.
 In the shorter-time period which we use the data for, we look for a substitutio
n between medium-term assets (e.g.
 furniture, housing, automobiles and financial assets) and more immediate
 expensive non-durable expenditure (we exclude the expenditure on education
 for children from the total expenditure; we also don't count items that
 are only consumed by 10 or less houses - these are "mortgage, rice_paddy,
 nut_products, wild_birds, packaged_fish, miscdrinkpowder, readymade_tea_coffee,
 winespirits").
 A consumer ought to be get some status advantage by simply believing that
 there is a status advantage through a probability of promotion of self-evaluati
on by expensive non-durable expenditure (denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

)- even though there isn't any real advantage from the non-durable expenditure.
 A consumer tries to optimise the utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(C,A,q)$
\end_inset

 over this short-term period.
 The intertemporal substitution for status is between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 while all the needs are represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 All consumers have needs - which are driven by age and number of children
 or elderly non-working in the family - nothing else.
 The needs require a certain q and a certain A, but not the expensive categories
 - which are required for status competitions.
 A consumer therefore doesn't choose q as much shes chooses C.
 In developing countries, one doesn't have the option to substitute A with
 q,C so the consumer has only the discrete choice of having A or forgoing
 it completely.
 Status is therefore quite discrete and savings dependent in the short-run.
 The cost of purchase is steeper in the developing world for assets A (hence
 consumption more discrete for A).
 The cost-function cognisant of this discreteness can compare the consumption
 in the two markets.
 The short-run status function 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\psi(A,C)$
\end_inset

 contributes to the utility.
 The cost function therefore depends on the discreteness of prices of A
 (to purchase an asset or not to purchase and asset).
 The consumer chooses to go for quality instead of an asset if the price
 of an asset is too high.
 Developed markets provide less opportunities to save (and more credit).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let status be represented by a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 and income-occupation level

\end_inset

.
 These are all discrete variables -which should relate with consumption.
 Investing in education would increase the probability of status promotion.
 Those who invest in education would increase the likelihood of higher status
 for their children.
 Since our time-series is only for a few years, we assume that education
 level and occupation levels don't change (education does not increase one's
 own status in any case as we don't consider status of individuals who are
 not at a working age i.e.
 we ignore their status until they have exited the education system).

While the current analysis is cross-sectional, some challenges in analysis
 of demand would involve a correct proxy for changes in supply.
 If, for example, we observe supply (introduction of phones, internet) only
 through microdata, then without availability of price-data we can't tell
 whether people are flocking to the new items or just that supply has made
 them cheaper.

The elasticities can be understood in terms of the PIGLOG functions but
 assets too must be considered.
 In the time-series the discrete choice model must be used, whereas in cross
 section we resort to dummies.
 We cannot use quality - we only have weights - which are influenced.
 We don't need all LHS weights to be independent.
 That is not the assumption.
 Expensive and inexpensive items - that is enough (meat+ beef) for food,
 electiricty for energy, others don't have price differences.

Tanzania is the first country to be analysed in the study.

 The data chosen for the preliminary analysis is from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) conducted by the World Bank.
 LSMS includes expenditure microdata from about 10,000 households - with
 many of the expenditure categories of potential status significance.

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

 region and same employment-type have reasonably similar incomes.
 The variance in incomes recorded for the same local group can give an estimate
 of how noisy the data is due to self-reporting.

 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

) and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that
 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.

 The endogeneity of total expenditure requires instrumentation - Kaus uses
 instruments suggested by Charles, Roussanov and Hurst - including positive-inco

 Kaus then performs two 2SLS regressions - one with income controls and
 total-expenditure as control variables

The first-change of sign when income controls are added implies that after
 accounting for income of household head, the coloured and black groups
 spend more on visible consumption.
 Total expenditure is not a perfect proxy of permanent income - which justifies
 instrumentation.
 After resolving these endogeneity concerns - with a regression of visible
 expenditure as dependent variable and total-expenditure as one of the control
 variables - the signs are revised - although 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 does not change a lot.
 Adding demographic controls to the 2SLS regression - shows significance
 of age, urban/rural area and family size - but coefficients are still not
 lowered significantly.
 This confirms that coloured and black social groups spend a rather disproportio
nate amount on visible consumption.
 Kaus paper is interested in testing whether the rise in average group income
 reduces the visible consumption.
 The regression considers average-incomes of particular provinces for every
 group (black/white/coloured).
 This regression shows the effect more on black-social-group than the white-soci
al-group - a difference that author argues points out alternate ways of
 signaling for white-social-group relative to black-social-group.

 variable in CEX data - which is recorded side-by-side with the race variable.
 This means that households/individuals can associate with either white
 or black while recording their ethnicity.
 Only about 1489 out of 22980 households surveyed in years 2004, 2009 and
 2014, for example, associate with neither white nor black.
 If that criterion is relaxed (i.e.
 if anyone reporting the horref1 variable is considered hispanic for the
 study) the number of Hispanics in the survey almost doubles.
 Starting with no controls(I)

 (with black-dummy and hispanic-dummy), the coefficients for coloured and
 black are negative (i.e.
 black and hispanic social groups spend less on visible consumption than
 the white population).
 These coefficients flip signs after adding income controls(II)

The authors report problems with the quality of income data in the survey
 and point out the log-expenditure is a better candidate for the study.
 Using total expenditure as a control, the coefficients for black and hispanic
 groups rise significantly(III)

 The endogeneity of total expenditure requires instrumentation - these are
 positive-income-dummy, cube-of-income-level, dummies for under-secondary-educat
ion, secondary-education and degree-education.
 The 2SLS regression is performed with education as instrument variables

 The instrumentation thus performed (Specification IV in Table

) results in lower coefficients for the black and hispanic dummies.
 When demographic params are added(VI), the coefficients lower - however
 more for the hispanic_dummy than for the black_dummy.

 using the context of the item's utility.
 If the item performs two functions e.g.
 a musical instrument (or any entertainment-related item), it could be classifie
d either as an appliance or a personal product.
 The social context of the item's usage helps resolve this ambiguity.
 Similarly, the regional variation and supply-asymmetries related to the
 item can also complicate how an item is classified.
 Mosquito-nets (which available in the survey), for example, may seem relevant
 to land & housing - and therefore relevant for potential status value.
 However, they can hardly be considered a candidate for pecuniary emulation
 - since there is no asset which a consumer overspends on mosquito nets
 to compensate for.
 Moreover, even if there was price differentiation in mosquito-nets (and
 we were to consider them for status consumption), we would need to observe
 the effect of climate on the consumption - since the need for mosquito
 nets is removed in a drier and cooler climate.
 Just the way one cannot view the lack of electricity (or a similar commodity)
 within a region as the consumers' lack of preference towards it in the
 region, one cannot view any other item whose distribution is skewed due
 to region without considering the region of availability as a control variable.
 While we do include region in all our analysis (see expensiveregion dummy
 in the results), there are cases when consumption may be driven by unobserved
 variables (e.g.
 insurance costs associated with theft frequencies).
 In such cases, we have no choice but to remove the item from the consideration
 towards status consumption.

Housing and education are worth commenting further.
 Education is included in the total expenditure as is rental expenditure.
 However, we do not consider house rent as part of housing-related expenditure
 - simply because our goal is to measure the expenditure on items common
 for those who rent a house and those who own it.
 
\end_layout

We thus test for the two effects which we have discussed earlier.
 First is the test of pecuniary emulation - to check if those with fewer
 assets tend to spend more in certain categories.
 Second is the test of influence of availability on the budget shares for
 certain comomdities.

We use four types of assets in the regression - housing (house ownership),
 agricultural (ploughs,tractors etc.), electric (electricity driven appliances)
 and equipment (furniture etc.).
 The housing types 1,2,3 represent owned, rented and free housing types
 respectively.
 The results are presented in the Table

.
 We can see that the expenditure on personal products is higher for renters
 when compared to those who own a house.
 Renters tend to spend less on housing related items and proportionately
 less on education too.
 This could be seen as an evidence of pecuniary emulation - but the evidence
 for such a tendency is weak - outside of housing.
 Those who own electricity driven assets spend more on both energy and personal
 products.
 Those who don't own a car or other means of transport don't spend more
 on personal products - instead they seem to pay quite a bit for public
 transport.
 Further, those with less equipment (and less assets in general) spend a
 higher portion of their income on food.
 Within the categories, we can see the role of sparsely available commodities.
 Energy has clear segregation (difference in budget shares) due to electricity,
 education has one due to preference for the English language and so on.
 Items that are sparsely available in other categories are shown in the
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:rare_items"

\end_inset

.
 As is clear from the table, there are more severe inequalities that exist
 in rural areas for items in categories other than food (.e.
 no substitutes are available for the sparsely available item in the rural
 areas).
 In conclusion, the pecuniary emulations seems to exist only for housing.
 Judging by the OLS regressions alone, the transport and food categories
 seem to present a lot of opportunity for indicating differences in income.
