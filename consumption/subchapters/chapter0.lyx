INTRODUCTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is difficult to pin down the definition of a status good.
 Unlike for food, housing where energy physical space or calorific value
 can help us estimate quality chosen by a consumer, status is not so much
 a property of the item consumer as much it is of the society where the
 good is consumed and the social standing that the consumer of the item
 has at the time of consumption.
 We attempt to extend the framework of utility to understand status consumption
 as an expectation of social mobility -so that the utility derived from
 an item (and hence the expenditure) depends on the expected change in the
 consumer's social standing that changes over time as more assets are acquired.
 In the model we outline, we use a generalised definition of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asset
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to track a consumer's status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a significant amount of literature that interprets status utility
 to a consumer as a product's visibility - which is measured either through
 direct surveys or purchases in quality.
 We argue that for us to have a general theory of status - the Ireland model's
 inference function-based approach may not be enough - as the severe inequalitie
s in the developing markets reduce the relevance of visibility.
 Further, given the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes visible
 consumption, it becomes difficult to associate visible consumption with
 status.
 With the recent economic developments in the sub-Saharan African countries
 - most particularly due to high levels of urban migration - it is likely
 that the spending patterns would give way to status-related expenditure
 much the way they have elsewhere.
 A model of status in terms of quality and assets is an attempt to describe
 conspicuous consumption in a more general context than of the upper-middle
 class developments in the United States where it was originally described
 by Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that across the developed and the developing world, consumers associate
 status to i) 
\series bold
quality of consumption
\series default
 and ii) 
\series bold
permanence of high income
\series default
.
 This is applicable to any society where markets have allowed mobility for
 at least a few decades.
 Without the possibility of markets, we cannot talk of status consumption
 and with the sort of mobility markets offer, we believe that the traditional
 hierarchies of the society have been challenged in a way that reliance
 on consumption for status becomes relevant.
 We emphasise that any study of of status through consumption is limited
 to these how segmented the supply of the commodities are and how contrained
 the demand of items of income.
 The two factors we use essentially attempt to measure this with consumption.
 Status by definition cannot be that of everybody and must be understood
 in the context of how limited the resources are.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite a significant interest is taken in status consumption in the developing
 countries in the recent years, a comparison of the effect of economic inequalit
ies on status consumption amongst the developing countries or with the developed
 countries has been rarely undertaken.
 It seems obvious that the perceived status differences would be higher
 in a more unequal society - since status perceptions should be aligned
 with economic inequalities.
 However, it can be argued that social inequalities are shaped by historical
 events over a much longer period of time than what consumer surveys are
 conducted over.
 Therefore social inequalities may not always follow economic inequalities
 or economic inequalities may have a smaller effect on status than the social
 ineuqalities that have developed over centuries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of opening ourselves to the debate on social psychological perceptions
 of economic conditions, we focus to studying how measures of economic inequalit
ies (proxied with assets and measures of status) may relate with status
 signaling that is performed through expensive non-durable consumption i.e.
 the improvement in quality of expenditure.
 We believe that the literature on the behavioural life-cycle model can
 improve our understanding of status related consumption.
 To formulate a model for status, we go beyond the idea of conspicuous consumpti
on - which often limits itself to exclusive consumption by the rich.
 In an environment of severe economic inequalities, the options for conspicuous
 consumption are limited to an even smaller part of the population.
 We extend this idea of exclusive consumption - therefore - to look for
 instances of high quality consumption amongst the different categories
 in the survey where status could be derived from.
 We then inspect how the quality consumption could be related to the ownership
 of assets.
 In Tanzania for example - which we explore in the study - we cannot argue
 that buying clothes indicate higher status signaling without observing
 what the effect of getting electricity or moving to a bigger house may
 have on status (nor can we ignore the possibility that those spending on
 electricity or housing may actually be cutting down on clothing expenditure).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we move further with the comparison of status consumption across
 the developing and the developed countries, we need a precise way of measuring
 the i) 
\series bold
quality 
\series default
of consumption and ii) the 
\series bold
social standing
\series default
 of the consumers.
 The standardisation of quality is performed simply by comparing consumer
 baskets between the selected countries.
 Except for some items that would be missing in the developing country,
 this is a relatively easy task if we rely on the availability of price
 information (or average cost of items) by classifying high-quality (expensive)
 items apart from their cheaper substitutes.
 For measuring the differences in social standing (social capital or status
 capital as described in some of the literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

) of the consumers - which is relatively difficult - we bank on the measures
 of socio-economic-status (SES).
 SES is a standard measure of the socio-economic status often used in the
 sociological and health studies.
 We extend SES to include permanence of high income and of quality consumption.
 The long-term status as a vector of income, education, region/locality/neighbor
hood as well as a history of quality consumption and assets ownership.
 This is in line with the marketing literature on use of assets as identity
 (see Baghchi et al.).
 The inclusion of assets and quality effectively endogenises status in the
 model and relates it with consumption.
 This is crucial since every other determinant of status (income, education,
 occupation or residence) is fixed in the short-run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accumulation of assets thus serves as one of indicators of stability
 of high income - as we expect individuals to purchase assets only if their
 expectation of stability of income is high (higher than it is when compared
 to the case when they higher quality non-durable consumption).
 To compare the asset accumulation in a developed and a developing country,
 we order assets in the market based on the cost of acquisition.
 The differences in the costs of the two successive assets in the order
 matter present the substitutability between asset acquisition and quality
 consumption.
 A higher difference between two successive asset costs would make the status
 indication through quality more tempting for a consumer.
 The absence of credit - as is often the case in developing countries -
 would make the difference between successive asset costs higher than in
 the developed countries (where markets are more developed and either credit
 to purchase assets or direct rental of assets is available).
 A comparison of status consumption is thus performed by observing expensive
 non-durable consumption - view as the quality consumption - relative to
 the differences between the current and next point of asset acquisition
 in the cost curve of assets over a period of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
LITERATURE SURVEY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have hinted before, the argument that the status differences must
 have an effect on consumption is not as much an economic argument as it
 is a social psychological one.
 To comment on status consumption across countries, one makes the implicit
 assumption that inherently similar economic conditions and same social
 inequalities should result in the same levels of status consumption.
 Without this assumption, one cannot rule out that despite the same observed
 spending on quality, the status differences may be perceived differently
 in one society compared to another with similar distribution of assets.
 A commentary on status through consumption has its limitations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of literature, however draws wide-ranging conclusions simply by observing
 consumption on a limited set of items.
 A vague definition of status consumption helps little in validating such
 conclusions.
 Though not unqualified, these claims leave themselves to a lot of debate
 - e.g.
 do social identities matter despite differences in asset ownership and
 strength of social networks in the countries with non-homoegenous populations,
 does spatial segregation increase or decrease status-consumption and so
 on.
 We believe that economics can only provide pial answers to many of such
 questions - which are intertwined with the social history of the countries
 in the context.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can also be argued that in the absence of a strong definition of status
 consumption, our 
\shape italic
apriori
\shape default
 knowledge of one group having more status than another can make the higher
 spending on a certain items by the group with lesser status automatically
 appear as an instance of status-indication.
 To elaborate this argument, let's consider social groups A and B with disparate
 levels of consumption on a certain items and with A having higher status
 in the society than B (a fact known as common knowledge).
 If the definition of status items isn't clear and if B hadn't spent disproporti
onately higher on conspicuous items, then either those items would have
 not been seen as conspicuous or we may have concluded that status is indicated
 through other means.
 Without an exact definition of status or a status-item, the uncertainty
 of what constitutes relative conspicuous consumption between the two groups
 is always higher than our own subjective observation of the status of one
 group over that of the other.
 Therefore the use of consumption alone in determining if one group has
 more status than the other is rather problematic.
 We attempt to alleviate this problem by fixing the definition status in
 terms of income, occupation and education - while letting asset purchases
 provide the uncertainty in the short-term .
 While this definition offers less linguistic flexibility than what the
 variety of literature on conspicuous consumption would offer, it helps
 find the limits of a model of status that is based on consumption.
 It cannot be denied that a society where everyone is equally educated with
 similar occupation ranks (income-based) and owns similar assets may still
 have perceived status differences - but our model would predict that the
 differences would be lesser than in one where the differences in education
 and occupation are wider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that this rudimentary model using the non-durable consumption
 help relate development of markets with consumption.
 It could be possible - for example - to test whether prolonged measures
 of forced economic equality (i.e.
 uniform but depressed asset ownership) can influence non-durable consumption
 asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes (a problem that may
 be relevant for countries in Africa).
 Friehe et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrieheGermany"

\end_inset

 perform a similar analysis by comparing the visible consumption in the
 regions of erstwhile East and West Germany and comment on the effect of
 the past stagnant and well-performing states of their respective economies
 on status consumption after reunification.
 If macroeconomic factors and issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) can be controlled for,
 then such a model for demand can explain the demand pressures induced by
 economic inequalities across countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the studies in marketing research have explored conspicuous consumption
 in great detail, the studies in the conventional econometric demand analysis
 have not addressed the topic in nearly the same enthusiasm.
 One reason is the clear lack of data on quality in consumer surveys, another
 reason could also be that the rational consumer of a typical demand analysis
 (who knows all about her future plans) can hardly engage in conspicuous
 consumption.
 As Thaler et al had argued in their influential paper on a behavioural
 life-cycle hypothesis, there should be no overeating and overspending if
 the consumers were rational (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

).
 If there is nothing to be gained by conspicuous consumption (i.e.
 Veblen's claim of futility of conspicuous consumption), then there is no
 way for the rational consumer to derive any utility from it.
 However, the mere existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there
 is some utility to be derived by spending on status or quality.
 Ireland model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

 - using a visibility factor - argue that the perception of one's income
 by others derives an additional utility (see Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

 for this substantiation and an empirical approach towards the Ireland model).
 As long as conspicuous consumption is exist - one can argue that the visibility
 factor in Ireland model ought to be non-zero .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visibility factor based model has its merits, but we find that the assumptio
n of status being derived from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

futile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items is too strong for an empirical study.
 The futility assumption makes particularly less sense in the developing
 world 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 where there are far fewer exclusive conspicuous items.
 The empirical classification of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

status-items
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is also fraught with problems (escaped only through a consumer survey of
 one's own) - as an item both provides status advantages and advantages
 through quality of consumption.
 Instead of deciding on a crisp boundary between visible and non-visible
 utilities, our model maintains that both quality (signaling elitism) and
 asset ownership (signaling that it'll take longer for others to acquire
 a particular costly asset) contribute to status.
 The model doesn't treat status consumption as futile - instead it relates
 all status-related consumption with perceptions of social mobility.
 To extend a theory to the developing economies or to lower and lower-middle
 classes in the developed world, we believe it is necessary to relieve the
 assumption that conspicuous items are futile (see Ustuner et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 for difficulties in extending the literature on developed countries on
 conspicuous consumption to the developing world).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An econometric model for status-consumption is thus developed with the assertion
 that status consumption offers no advantage to a rational consumer except
 through a promise or belief of social mobility.
 This is similar to models of myopic behaviour in the literature on demand
 (See Shefrin-Thaler
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

 and Muellbauer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."

\end_inset

).
 In our extension of the model, status-related consumption is viewed as
 a contribution to the expectation of status promotion through consumption.
 In the empirical study taken in the current chapter, we look at the choice
 of quality vs accumulation of assets.
 In the further substantiation of the model in an intertemporal substitution
 setting, we include probabilities of asset ownership in the measure of
 status consumption across countries of disparate economic conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assets-and-quality-based status model we propose also helps deconstruct
 the role of social identity as a vehicle of status.
 While identities are considered extremely important for status in many
 studies in the developing as well as the developed countries (see Chao
 et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Chao1998"

\end_inset

 and Khamis et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia"

\end_inset

), we believe that the difference in assets owned by the identities over
 time can explain how identities carry status across different countries.
 In terms of the model, an identity (religious, racial etc.) carries status
 only through a history of past asset ownership and persistent-high quality
 consumption - a criterion that allows us to quantify the role of identity
 in status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that visibility is not to be discarded in the model.
 Our contention is only that visibility provides a part of status consumption.
 By means of an analogy, let's consider how status is signalled through
 car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption might tell us that consumers pay
 more attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality of tyres etc.).
 However, if we were to study the signaling through car ownership in the
 urban and rural areas, we would have to see primarily - i) the constraints
 on occupation and income that exist in the respective areas and ii)) the
 price differences in the cars being sold in the market.
 In our original problem of status consumption, while it is true that individual
s spend more on their outward appearances (despite controlling for everything
 else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not all what status
 consumption comprises of (see the Figure and Eastman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Eastman1999"

\end_inset

 for the terminology around status consumption).
 Visibility is modeled as the order of weights of categories in the model.
 In the different categories of consumption items we identify, we assume
 that the consumption is weighted according to a preference order over categorie
s - a consumer could get more status utility from transport - as an example
 - than from food or vice versa.
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we identify six categories - Food,
 Energy, Transport, Personal Care, Social Functions and Housing/Land - where
 visibility doesn't have much of a role to play within each of the category
 even though the consumers may consider one category more visible than the
 other.
 An order of visibility exists for the identified categories but not for
 items within the category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
MODEL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the first-stage of the model, we use the simple-repackaging approach
 for every category.
 Based on the model we propose, we are interested in the distribution of
 the quality of consumption and the ownership of assets throughout the populatio
n.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We rely on the price of an item relative to its cheaper substitutes for
 the same functional utility.
 Except for the order of categories (food, transport), what constitutes
 status consumption - is quality and permanent assets within each category
 (see Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 - where the case for a ranking order of status is motivated).
 Apart from income and education (which can be seen as longer term assets),
 the status obtained is the aggregate of quality and asset possession.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The status items can exist in every category and they are not assumed to
 be either equivalent or interchangeable.
 The weight the consumer puts on the quality in each category ( i.e.
 the portion of total expenditure spent on the expensive non-durable consumption
) varies for every category - forming a distribution of weights that varies
 for every individual depending on her needs and current status.
 This distribution of expensive nondurable consumption however changes -
 as the individuals acquire assets and spend on upkeep and maintenance costs
 for assets or as they give up on hopes on acquiring costlier assets.
 It is assumed that a consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality
 (there is no sufficient evidence of that happening).
 Therefore a rise in expensive nondurable consumption must come either from
 an increase in income or from depletion of savings (sale of assets).
 Likewise a drop in expensive non-durable consumption must be due to purchase
 of assets, addressing of more urgent needs or a drop in income.
 All rational consumers hope to increase their social status through consumption
 as they increase their utility in their lifetime.
 Therefore either asset ownership or quality consumption is attempted at
 all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement of status as a vector of income, education, region (locality,
 neighborhood) and assets - is based on the definition of socio-economic
 status (SES) used in the research in sociological and health sciences.
 Since income and education are fixed in the short-run,, what changes most
 often is the acquisition of assets that are available in the market if
 the needs of the consumer haven't changed.
 Whenever assets are purchased, the consumer must undergo a change in the
 weight of the quality in the consumption categories if i) her needs (including
 status needs) haven't changed (status can only be indicated through asset
 ownership or quality) and ii) if she is not saving for another asset (the
 consumer is more likely to spend on quality if she doesn't have more assets
 planned to purchase in the future).
 We assume that except for the change brought about by assets or needs,
 a consumer doesn't change her taste in status items i.e.
 she has a fixed allocation of how much status she ought to derive from
 every category of consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we identify the six categories in the data from consumption survey,
 we also recognise that quality variation doesn't always exist in the market
 for every category.
 For example, in Tanzania - the car rental market seems small and the variation
 in the quality of cars being sold may be smaller than in a typical city
 in the developed world.
 When quality variation is not observed, only the relevant assets in a category
 can bring status.
 If status needs are fixed over short-term, then the unavailability of the
 quality variation in the category would either increase the savings for
 the next available asset in the category or increase the quality consumption
 in some other category (assuming status needs remain the same).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate this substitution with an example, consider a middle-income
 family that cuts down on expenses (due to loss of income) by moving to
 a cheaper area where the rents are lower but the restaurants are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place - so the consumption would either
 shift to saving for a better car (asset) or improve quality in some other
 category (better jewelry, better schooling for kids etc.) - assuming the
 needs of the family haven't changed (including the status needs).
 The difference between needs and status-needs is not a concern for this
 model - as it only observes the differences between high-price and low-price
 consumption in the same category and assumes that the essential needs are
 independent of the wealth of the consumer.
 In the particular example, needs for the family can be proxied with the
 number of family members.
 Also, for the purposes of the model, the difference between status of a
 rich and a poor family is not through disparate educational needs of the
 children but through a more general need to maintain status across all
 categories.
 This is the aggregate sense of status derived by all categories - and is
 driven by wealth and income - rather than high-class or low-class needs
 - as the model views all status needs either as expensive non-durable consumpti
on or asset possession.
 This substitution in the model between quality and asset possession is
 driven by the prices of assets and that of quality alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To specify the status utility - which depends on both on expensive non-durable
 consumption (ENDC) and possession of assets (POA)) status.
 , status doesn't require quality consumption to matter over the long-run.
 Quality consumption can indicate the net asset worth and the expectations
 for future social mobility - but it is only observed as the inertia in
 the selection of weights for quality in every category - without influencing
 status directly.
 A consumer sets her weight on status quality based on her perception of
 status - but the real changes to status are brought about only through
 assets (which are one of the factors of change in weights - by definition)

\begin_layout Standard
There are two important assumptions in the model.
 First, for simplicity, we assume that every category is dominated by assets
 or by nondurable consumption.
 Assets in this sense are always more expensive than the higher quality
 non-durable consumption.
 This gets around the issue that we effectively ignore the quality differences
 in assets when assuming high-quality non-durable consumption dominates
 in a category.
 Empirically, this assumption is not as problematic - since there are no
 assets in the food category (or energy) that could matter for status while
 the quality consumption in housing is made irrelevant by high (relative)
 price of housing.
 This is not to say that a model with quality variation amongst assets is
 not possible (a consumer can choose between types of housing for example)
 - but the assumption would need to be relived if quality-variation amongst
 assets was to be considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model of asset and quality for status, the asset purchase has a more
 immediate impact on the status than a sudden increase in quality.
 High-quality consumption and purchase of assets thus reflect the short-term
 and long-term status needs of the consumer.
 The superior quality is enough for an item to become a luxury (as we outline
 with a rudimentary Stone Geary model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DATA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look at the consumption in Tanzania and compare it with South Africa
 - which may be more socially unequal but is an overall less poor country.
 A country like Tanzania is likely to have more economic inequality and
 less development of common services compared to South Africa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Descriptive statistics on the Tanzanian data are then presented.
 We focus on food expenditure - which is recorded with a greater level of
 detail than other expenditures.
 As market prices are recorded for food items, we check how the higher budget
 shares are associated with choice of higher price items.
 We find that the consumption of highest prices items doesn't always result
 in higher budget shares.
 Tea and coffee don't form the highest budget shares (while they are expensive).
 Items that are of high price and have low budget shares while have cheaper
 substitutes in the market do qualify for the expensive non-durable consumption
 criteria for quality.
 Other descriptive statistics measure, e.g.
 the skewnesss of total expenditure on the item can also hint whether only
 a small proportion of population gets to spend more on the item.
 Noticeably, the budget share on skin-cream etc.
 - which we may have normally associated with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption - is quite low.
 The variance on the consumption of skin-cream is in fact lower than that
 for bread or milk.
 The budget shares for cigarettes seem quite high (and quite skewed) - however,
 since there are no cheaper substitutes available we don't consider cigarettes
 as part of status consumption.
 Although the descriptive statistics seem to confirm the heuristic that
 amongst many substitutable items, the distribution of expensive varieties
 is more likely to be skewed, it is worth emphasising that skewness or mean-cost
 - is not to be used as a criteria to pick items for status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When comparing a developing economy with a developed economy, one would
 always find the consumption items in the developed world that have no equivalen
t in the developing country.
 For example, while comparing the Tanzanian data with the South African
 survey (IES), we do not find holiday expenses and car rental in the Tanzanian
 LSMS survey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the partition of certain categories is of particular significance
 to our analysis.
 The simple repackaging model requires that the quality variants of an item
 are perfect substitutes.
 We therefore make sure that only the variants of an item are grouped into
 perfect substitutes.
 In food, we put goat and meat in the same group - but not tea and coffee
 - because there is little sense in substituting.
 The categories are divided so that demand can be considered separable but
 and lumped together when they are closed substitutes.
 Instead of considering beef, pork and goat as varieties of meat - we lump
 them together as high price sources of protein - a step performed primarily
 to observe the effect of switching to pricier sources of protein (rather
 than pricier sources of meat).
 Similarly, when analysing holiday expenses in South African data (IES),
 we don't distinguish between expensive holidays and cheaper holidays -
 but count expenditure on holidays as expensive non-durable consumption
 under entertainment/personal-care.
 Instead of a cheaper holiday, we consider measure of the expenditure on
 holiday.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We refrain from using detailed price of assets purchased (available in the
 Tanzanian data for 2012) - since recording of assets is different in SA
 IES and TNZ LSMS surveys.
 More particularly, the expenditure on furniture and other assets is a diary
 expenditure in the SA IES data while the assets are recorded separately
 as a recall in the Tanzanian LSMS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we are interested in studying the effect of ethnicity, but given the
 different make-up of the two countries, the data for ethnicity is not comaprabl
e either -SA IES records race, the LSMS records religion and native-language.
 The social identity data can thus only be only be used for studying segmentatio
n of demand within each economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the recall method is particularly volatile in a developing country
 where regular payment setups are hardly a norm.
 We must be careful therefore with interpreting differences in the budget
 share over snapshots (2008,2010 and 2012) for a particular household -
 as the household may not have expenditures in all three instances of the
 survey.
 For cases such as electricity in Tanzania, we in fact find the survey field
 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main lighting fuel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 more reliable for the test of electricity consumption than the last expenditure
 on electricity (note that kerosene is much cheaper than electricity in
 Tanzania).
 Such matters can be made worse in cases of expenditure where seasonality
 (time of the year) is also an important factor.
 To address the issue, therefore, we are careful not to draw any conclusions
 from a household's expenditure over the time-series (i.e.
 survey snapshots in 2008, 2010 and 2012) - but rely on the average expenditure
 over a collection of households (in a particular region etc.).

\begin_layout Subsection
RESULTS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of econometric analysis is to see how long-term status needs of
 the consumers - fulfilled with purchase of assets - a change that translates
 into an upward movement in status in our model - relate with the short-term
 needs fulfilled with expensive non-durable consumption.
 Much the way we were wary of claiming that consumption on items indicates
 perception of status hierarchies, we don't claim that the observed social
 mobility - recorded in this way - serves as a measure of how status is
 perceived in society.
 We compare the variation in the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC)
 across occupation ranks, education and the assets owned across the two
 countries (see quantile regression results).
 We also inspect how the expenditure on purchase of permanent assets vs
 non-durable consumption differs amongst the identified social identities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model doesn't require that a consumer purchases a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

composite item
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of quality (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities"

\end_inset

).
 Instead, we believe that quality is a concern for the researcher and not
 for the consumer - who merely exercises her choice given the set of products
 available in the market for given prices (see the clarification from Nelson
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

).
 Since status would always be priced in the market, a status item would
 be always more expensive than the rest of the items which provide the same
 functionality (see Chao et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chao1998"

\end_inset

 for substantiation of this argument).
 
\end_layout

For the econometric methods, it has been demonstrated in the literature
 that additive functions are not enough for substitutability (see Deaton
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 We use the dual-approach - most famously described in the AIDS method -
 and use a simple formulation of the cost-function to understand how a constrain
ed regression over the cross-section can tell us about the consumption across
 the population of consumers.
 Our conclusions rely on the elasticities obtained in this manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear that the medium assets are limited to the cities - and the household
s in the rural areas miss out on ownership of these assets.
 This corresponds to major differences in the life-styles between rural
 and urban areas in the developing countries.
 There are less opportunities for expensive non-durable consumption in the
 rural parts of Tanzania - except for marriage - where the expenditure seems
 proportionally high.
 The status is more likely to be derived from assets in the rural areas
 - compared to a more advanced economy such as that of South Africa.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Veblen's literature itself dates from a time when rapid economic developments
 took place in the United States - transitioning from a largely agrarian
 society to an industrialised one.
 The relevance of status through purchasing good is tied with industrial
 development.
 Less industrial development would mean less nondurable consumption - but
 not necessarily perceived differences in society.
 Any measure of how much status differences exist in the society - or if
 one - is not possible with consumption alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that it's the relevance of identity to status that should address
 such differences - as well as social status.
 We argue that over the long-term it is the status.
 Identity can matter but only as long as it has been associated with assets
 in the past.
 We cannot understand identity without a long-term effect.
 However, a cross-section analysis can detect the influence of identity
 on accumulation of assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visible consumption must also include visible assets too (if not education
 and occupation) - i.e.
 consumption that may be inherited or not consumed weekly (assets such as
 housing or automobiles that are not bought as frequently).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is difficult to say explicitly that the status is influence by nonudrable
 consumption.
 It might actually make sense that nondurable consumption is used to compensate
 for not having as much as assets as those who have have a perceived higher
 status (determined by assets, occupation and education).
 If non-durable consumption is correlated with social mobility (i.e.
 purchase of assets or an upward movement in education and occupation for
 a member of the household), the corresponding non-durable consumption matters
 less to the household - whereas those who don't see any changes in long-term
 possession of assets or changes in occupation-rank or education levels,
 would have no other means achieve status other than through the non-durable
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be tested with data.
 It is not difficult to see that asset purchases are fewer in the developed
 countries where the markets are evolved enough to offer assets (electricity,
 automobiles etc.) as services.
 The non-durable consumption makes up for the lack of possession - still
 it doesn't change that status in the long-term.
 This is the research question.

\begin_layout Standard

 not call their consumption as status consumption.
 To qualify that statement, we.
 Status needs are inseparable from other needs.
 A rational consumer doesn't spend on status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, if they are not purchasing assets in the sense that their
 long-term status (determined by assets, occupation, education) is not changing,
 then - then they choose not to buy assets but to improve their nondurable
 assets instead - their nondurable consumption is for status - in fact,
 status is constituted in the nondurable consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental question is whether demand can be compared at all or not.
 Individuals have different needs.
 Why compare at all.
 The motivation for us is only how basic needs are addressed.
 Maslow hierarchy and the developing economy literature - would have us
 think that basic needs are all that matter and that individuals don't spend
 on anything but necessities when needs matter the most.
 This is indeed true.
 However, the local variation in demand may be insensitive to the global
 state of economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test whether the global categories pose a different problem in the developed
 countries.
 Clearly, the state plays a stronger role in the developed world (by definition)
 and the services are relied on more than they would be in the developing
 world.
 Still, overall spending on food, energy, transport, personal products and
 housing should be tied with supply.
 A comparison in demand between a developed and a developing country can
 give us insights only as long as we can cancel out the effects of supply.

 The growing competitions for status amongst the nascent working classes

The differences in purchasing power between the sections of a society and
 the mobility between them are key drivers of status-related consumption.
 That status and mobility can contribute to the economic development of
 a society is a belief that goes back to Adam Smith - who had proposed that
 the economic progress can be achieved by letting an exchange between the
 rich and poor thrive.

 One could argue that more spending on a conspicuous item would benefit
 the society as a whole - since the money obtained from the rich on the
 item could potentially fund employment and other opportunities.
 Electricity in Africa, for example, would be a model item for this purpose
 - an item whose consumption can drive the expansion of power plants and
 make electricity cheaper for everyone.
 More spending on signaling goods does not appear to be a social waste from
 this perspective.
 However, we note that not all marketable goods are as desirable as electricity
 and there may be goals more desirable than what the exchange between rich
 and poor can provide.

 In the developing world, on the other hand, the basic needs for the masses
 have still not been addressed.
 One could expect the exchange between rich and poor to draw the masses
 out of poverty - but we argue that there are limits to how much success
 can be achieved in the developing countries - the essential goods often
 lack robust markets in the developing countries and since marketable goods
 often create needs on their own, the development of market for conspicuous
 goods may prevent the status competitions from achieving the goals of social
 welfare.
 More so in the context of conspicuous consumption than elsewhere, an commodity
 exclusively available to the richer sections of the society can easily
 become a status good and thus the possibility of a social waste due to
 spending on status goods cannot be ruled out.

In other words, the limitations of status competitions matter in the developing
 world because the institutions in these countries are generally weak and
 have developed on the path to achieving goals of nationalism.
 The developing countries often face the problem of institutions just not
 being strong enough to allow the exchange between the rich and the poor
 to thrive.
 In the new urban settings in Africa, both tribal identities and the hierarchies
 formed through education, money or industrial assets can contribute to
 status competitions.
 While this development can encourage institutions of money and education

We only consider district level residence and primary spoken language as
 the demographic factors that may affect status consumption.
 Amongst all the factors that one may find relevant for status in a society,

Let's take example of the availability of electricity in Tanzania.
 If only the rich could afford electricity, then it being used by a smaller
 and richer part of the population may seem to have less significance than
 weddings - which are ubiquitous in the population (a regression with quantities
 consumed as dependent variable would bear more significance for items consumed
 by more consumers).
 One may be tempted to argue that items consumed by more people carry more
 significance for status than the item that is hardly accessible to the
 wider population, but status in a society is driven by both the supply
 of the item and the ability of the individual to purchase the item (disposable
 income).
 The interplay of supply, wealth and assets determine status in a society
 and thus belonging to a region or a social network where an asset is available
 asymmetrically, would also drive status.

Not all status goods need to exhibit flocking of consumers.
 If the item has been restricted to the richer section of the society for

 The small-scale private enterprise - which forms the majority of non-agrarian
 workforce in sub-Saharan Africa - receives very little governmental assistance

 In our view, the flight to urban areas is not merely an escape from despondent
 circumstances but also the access to an expanded consumption basket and
 a chance for improbable social mobilities.
 The introduction of industrial goods and the status needs of the consumers
 is therefore relevant to the trend of urban migration in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The observation that the indigenes have recently displaced non-indigenes
 or the more educated have replaced the less educated in conventional occupation
s in many sub-Saharan African countries for example, may very well have
 a detectable impact on status consumption.

While the data on social identity was not available for this study, we have
 used population density to proxy some of the effects of migration.
 We observe that the population density bears significance with consumption
 of items relevant for status.
 If similar products were available in both rural and urban areas, one may
 expect that the more communication between individuals that may potentially
 intensify the bandwagon effects and status competitions.
 While studying the effect of social interaction on income distribution,
 for example, Robert H.

The important question which we wish to answer is how to use the index for
 status.
 Without the data on quantity of electricity consumed, for example, the
 magnitude of the status variable cannot be easily determined.
 For food, we can see how expensive a certain calorific value is (although
 a consumer doesn't go into the market to buy calories).
 We use the ratio of electricity to all energy consumption and the ratio
 of beef or goat to all food as the status quantity that the consumer.
 However, this only gives utility and doesn't correspond to an actual price.
 Thus for 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{y}$
\end_inset

(electricity) and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}$
\end_inset

(kerosene), we can use 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{y}q_{y}}{p_{k}q_{k}+p_{y}q_{y}}$
\end_inset

 as a status measure but that this measure doesn't contribute to the total
 budget.
 It turns out we do need to scale the total consumption and have a proper
 ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The index numbers are based on base numbers and can be seen as ratio of
 cost-functions.
 It turns out we have no option but to guess the total amount of electricity
 used using the price index of electricity.
 We have the quantity of food so we can see how many units of the cheapest
 protein substitute could have been purchased for the same so that the total
 weight is revised - a certain quality factor becomes part of RHS (or we
 take total food expenditure into RHS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let status be represented by a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 of education level 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 and income-occupation level 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

.
 These are all discrete variables -which should relate with consumption.
 Investing in education would increase the probability of status promotion.
 Those who invest in education would increase the likelihood of higher status
 for their children.
 Since our time-series is only for a few years, we assume that education
 level and occupation levels don't change (education does not increase one's
 own status in any case as we don't consider status of individuals who are
 not at a working age i.e.
 we ignore their status until they have exited the education system).

Over a longer period of time, an individual spreads her expenditure across
 future expectations for a status upgrade for her family and her more immediate
 needs.
 In the shorter-time period which we use the data for, we look for a substitutio
n between medium-term assets (e.g.
 furniture, housing, automobiles and financial assets) and more immediate
 expensive non-durable expenditure (we exclude the expenditure on education
 for children from the total expenditure; we also don't count items that
 are only consumed by 10 or less houses - these are "mortgage, rice_paddy,
 nut_products, wild_birds, packaged_fish, miscdrinkpowder, readymade_tea_coffee,
 winespirits").
 A consumer ought to be get some status advantage by simply believing that
 there is a status advantage through a probability of promotion of self-evaluati
on by expensive non-durable expenditure (denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

)- even though there isn't any real advantage from the non-durable expenditure.
 A consumer tries to optimise the utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(C,A,q)$
\end_inset

 over this short-term period.
 The intertemporal substitution for status is between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 while all the needs are represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 All consumers have needs - which are driven by age and number of children
 or elderly non-working in the family - nothing else.
 The needs require a certain q and a certain A, but not the expensive categories
 - which are required for status competitions.
 A consumer therefore doesn't choose q as much shes chooses C.
 In developing countries, one doesn't have the option to substitute A with
 q,C so the consumer has only the discrete choice of having A or forgoing
 it completely.
 Status is therefore quite discrete and savings dependent in the short-run.
 The cost of purchase is steeper in the developing world for assets A (hence
 consumption more discrete for A).
 The cost-function cognisant of this discreteness can compare the consumption
 in the two markets.
 The short-run status function 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\psi(A,C)$
\end_inset

 contributes to the utility.
 The cost function therefore depends on the discreteness of prices of A
 (to purchase an asset or not to purchase and asset).
 The consumer chooses to go for quality instead of an asset if the price
 of an asset is too high.
 Developed markets provide less opportunities to save (and more credit).

 The quantities

\end_inset

are calculated based on the quantity or unit-equivalents of the cheapest
 substitute in the category and prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1},P_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the prices of the cheapest unit-substitute.
 The linear budget constraint are thus
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}Q_{1}+s_{1}\kappa_{1}=p_{1}q_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}Q_{2}+s_{2}\kappa_{2}=p_{2}q_{2}$

 to maximise

 Status is derived strictly by consuming 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1},s_{2}$

 The equivalent cost minimisation problem then amounts to minimising expenditure
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,P,\kappa)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the base-commodity and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 is the price of expensive category.
 In a cross-sectional analysis, 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 of expensive category is enough for this analysis.
 A two-state budgeting would require separability assumptions to hold -
 whose validity can only be achieved with price information.

We further assume that as prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$

 (and hence

) or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2},\kappa_{2}$
\end_inset

 structure or 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1},s_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}=\lambda s_{2}$
\end_inset

) the same.
 This assumption states only that a consumer maintains a certain balance
 of quality for the status benefit.
 This changes only when a major asset is purchased so that the status needs
 change drastically.
 This may allow a two-state budgeting because 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is treated as a function of current state of assets (which are fixed at
 the outset).
 In the first-state budgeting the consumer optimises total expenditure -
 which is made of the cost function for non-status utility 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{ns}(u,P_{1},P_{2},...)$
\end_inset

 and the cost of status maintenance - 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{s}(u,\kappa_{1},\kappa_{2},...)$
\end_inset

.
 Since a consumer has already fixed the proportion of expenditure on every
 category 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},...,\lambda_{c}...,)$
\end_inset

 ) the quality variable in the second-stage budgeting.
 The complementarity or supplementarity does not change for the groups -
 and the relationship between two items in any two different groups is changes
 only as response to the total expenditure (i.e response to price changes
 and total expenditure changes must use the same channels of communication
 in the commodity tree).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the two-state budgeting model, the expenditure on which status commodity
 is purchased in food is independent of which transport is purchased - except
 through cost.
 Strictly speaking all status is substitutable if price of one goes low
 the consumer might get her status from somewhere else.
 If we assume that she cuts down on status equivalently (across all categories)
 then that is not second-state budgeting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An empirical test is needed for a two-state budgeting model.
 In absence of price information for all the recall items, we cannot perform
 this using.
 However, if we were to use a two-state budgeting model, it is worth mentioning
 that the assumption of myopia (or inertia of choice) is stronger than that
 of weak separability and doesn't disrupt weak separability if it applies
 to items without status in consideration.
 To explain how a two-state budgeting approach might work with and without
 status items, let's take a two-group world of food and energy as an example
 so that within food and energy we have categories of beef-bread-milk and
 eletricity-kerosene-charcoal respectively.
 Without status, the items - food and energy - can be assumed (and tested
 empirically) to be separable groups as it is plausible for a consumer to
 allocate some money 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy respectively in the first-stage depending based on her
 knowledge of the price-indices for food and energy.
 Once the amounts 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 are decided, the consumer can subsequently decide how much of kerosene
 or electricity to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and how much beef or bread to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Individual prices of every item within the category would decide which
 food varieties and which energy sources are to be purchased.
 It is safe to assume therefore that cheaper bread (price-sensitivity for
 bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose a more expensive fuel
 (price-sensitivity for electricity, charcoal etc.) under the conditions
 of weak separability (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

 for details on the theory).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This assumption can indeed fall apart if we introduce status - if we assume
 that a consumer gets status from using electricity and from eating kobe
 beef interchangeably, then having decided on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 does not guarantee that she would not switch to more consumption on electricity
 if kobe beef becomes cheaper.
 This is because status is aggregated from across the commodities.
 Thus unlike in the case of energy and food without status, cheaper food
 can be compensated with more electricity.
 If price sensitivities and total expenditure sensitivities don't follow
 the same channel of communication in the tree - then necessary condition
 for two-stage separability is not met (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, our analysis is immensely simplified by assuming that given the
 additional income, a consumer would like to increase both amounts of kobe
 beef and electricity unless she feels there is a significant change in
 her status needs.
 With that assumption, all 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{s}$
\end_inset

 for status items 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 would move downwards even if one of the status items in a category were
 to increase in price.
 That the status consumption depends only on the total consumption on status
 across all the commodities is a condition stronger than that of weak separabili
ty.

 Expensiveness of nondurable expenditure is only found my availability of

For time-series analysis, can we use price indices for the aggregate measures
 of social functions, personal care or housing-related products.
 In other words, we don't know what drives the consumer to exercise the
 choice.
 Therefore, what we do is to compare the total expenditure on categories
 with respect to the assets purchased.
 This is the first-level of substitution - for which we don't have.
 One way would be to keep quality - substitution away from general substitution
 between categories in the intertemporal substitution problem.
 The quality substitution and  permanence substitution.

\begin_layout Standard
While the current analysis is cross-sectional, some challenges in analysis
 of demand would involve a correct proxy for changes in supply.
 If, for example, we observe supply (introduction of phones, internet) only
 through microdata, then without availability of price-data we can't tell
 whether people are flocking to the new items or just that supply has made
 them cheaper.

The elasticities can be understood in terms of the PIGLOG functions but
 assets too must be considered.
 In the time-series the discrete choice model must be used, whereas in cross

 We cannot use quality - we only have weights - which are influenced.
 We don't need all LHS weights to be independent.
 That is not the assumption.
 Expensive and inexpensive items - that is enough (meat+ beef) for food,
 electiricty for energy, others don't have price differences.

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

 region and same employment-type have reasonably similar incomes.
 The variance in incomes recorded for the same local group can give an estimate
 of how noisy the data is due to self-reporting.

 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.

 total-expenditure as control variables

The first-change of sign when income controls are added implies that after
 accounting for income of household head, the coloured and black groups
 spend more on visible consumption.
 Total expenditure is not a perfect proxy of permanent income - which justifies
 instrumentation.
 After resolving these endogeneity concerns - with a regression of visible

 does not change a lot.
 Adding demographic controls to the 2SLS regression - shows significance
 of age, urban/rural area and family size - but coefficients are still not
 lowered significantly.
 This confirms that coloured and black social groups spend a rather disproportio
nate amount on visible consumption.
 Kaus paper is interested in testing whether the rise in average group income
 reduces the visible consumption.
 The regression considers average-incomes of particular provinces for every
 group (black/white/coloured).
 This regression shows the effect more on black-social-group than the white-soci
al-group - a difference that author argues points out alternate ways of
 signaling for white-social-group relative to black-social-group.

 The hispanic dummy is inferred by the

 variable in CEX data - which is recorded side-by-side with the race variable.
 This means that households/individuals can associate with either white
 or black while recording their ethnicity.
 Only about 1489 out of 22980 households surveyed in years 2004, 2009 and
 2014, for example, associate with neither white nor black.
 If that criterion is relaxed (i.e.
 if anyone reporting the horref1 variable is considered hispanic for the
 study) the number of Hispanics in the survey almost doubles.
 Starting with no controls(I)

 (with black-dummy and hispanic-dummy), the coefficients for coloured and
 black are negative (i.e.
 black and hispanic social groups spend less on visible consumption than
 the white population).
 These coefficients flip signs after adding income controls(II)

The authors report problems with the quality of income data in the survey
 and point out the log-expenditure is a better candidate for the study.
 Using total expenditure as a control, the coefficients for black and hispanic
 groups rise significantly(III)

 The endogeneity of total expenditure requires instrumentation - these are
 positive-income-dummy, cube-of-income-level, dummies for under-secondary-educat
ion, secondary-education and degree-education.
 The 2SLS regression is performed with education as instrument variables

 The instrumentation thus performed (Specification IV in Table

) results in lower coefficients for the black and hispanic dummies.
 When demographic params are added(VI), the coefficients lower - however
 more for the hispanic_dummy than for the black_dummy.

For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, there were some
 necessary adjustments to be made for the classification of non-durable
 consumption into the wider categories of food, energy, transport, social
 functions, personal products, education and housing.
 The adjustments related to extrapolation of costs

Repairs and maintenance costs etc.
 are provided in the weekly diary - but they cannot be simply extrapolated
 to annual consumption without a consideration of the average life of the
 item being repaired or maintained.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 were trivial, while others related to classification anomalies were resolved
 using the context of the item's utility.
 If the item performs two functions e.g.
 a musical instrument (or any entertainment-related item), it could be classifie
d either as an appliance or a personal product.
 The social context of the item's usage helps resolve this ambiguity.
 Similarly, the regional variation and supply-asymmetries related to the
 item can also complicate how an item is classified.
 Mosquito-nets (which available in the survey), for example, may seem relevant
 to land & housing - and therefore relevant for potential status value.
 However, they can hardly be considered a candidate for pecuniary emulation
 - since there is no asset which a consumer overspends on mosquito nets
 to compensate for.
 Moreover, even if there was price differentiation in mosquito-nets (and
 we were to consider them for status consumption), we would need to observe
 the effect of climate on the consumption - since the need for mosquito
 nets is removed in a drier and cooler climate.
 Just the way one cannot view the lack of electricity (or a similar commodity)
 within a region as the consumers' lack of preference towards it in the
 region, one cannot view any other item whose distribution is skewed due
 to region without considering the region of availability as a control variable.
 While we do include region in all our analysis (see expensiveregion dummy
 in the results), there are cases when consumption may be driven by unobserved
 variables (e.g.
 insurance costs associated with theft frequencies).
 In such cases, we have no choice but to remove the item from the consideration
 towards status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Housing and education are worth commenting further.
 Education is included in the total expenditure as is rental expenditure.
 However, we do not consider house rent as part of housing-related expenditure
 - simply because our goal is to measure the expenditure on items common
 for those who rent a house and those who own it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We thus test for the two effects which we have discussed earlier.
 First is the test of pecuniary emulation - to check if those with fewer
 assets tend to spend more in certain categories.
 Second is the test of influence of availability on the budget shares for
 certain comomdities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
We use four types of assets in the regression - housing (house ownership),
 agricultural (ploughs,tractors etc.), electric (electricity driven appliances)
 and equipment (furniture etc.).
 The housing types 1,2,3 represent owned, rented and free housing types
 respectively.
 The results are presented in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{tabwlogx}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We can see that the expenditure on personal products is higher for renters
 when compared to those who own a house.
 Renters tend to spend less on housing related items and proportionately
 less on education too.
 This could be seen as an evidence of pecuniary emulation - but the evidence
 for such a tendency is weak - outside of housing.
 Those who own electricity driven assets spend more on both energy and personal
 products.
 Those who don't own a car or other means of transport don't spend more
 on personal products - instead they seem to pay quite a bit for public
 transport.
 Further, those with less equipment (and less assets in general) spend a
 higher portion of their income on food.
 Within the categories, we can see the role of sparsely available commodities.
 Energy has clear segregation (difference in budget shares) due to electricity,
 education has one due to preference for the English language and so on.
 Items that are sparsely available in other categories are shown in the
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:rare_items"

\end_inset

.
 As is clear from the table, there are more severe inequalities that exist
 in rural areas for items in categories other than food (.e.
 no substitutes are available for the sparsely available item in the rural
 areas).
 In conclusion, the pecuniary emulations seems to exist only for housing.
 Judging by the OLS regressions alone, the transport and food categories
 seem to present a lot of opportunity for indicating differences in income.
