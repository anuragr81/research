\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demand studies in the developing world often work with much sparser data
 which has less information on the individual households than the equivalent
 surveys in the developed countries.
 Recent surveys have mitigated many such issues - but the problems that
 arise out of the non-uniformity of institutions themselves make the standardisa
tion of data across the developing countries more challenging than in the
 developed world.
 Studies on quality of consumption - therefore - often suffer due the absence
 of brand or type-related details in the surveys.
 It is possible nevertheless to limit oneself to observing quality in food
 where the consumed brand or type is less relevant.
 The variation in quality in food can still provide us an idea of the quality-re
lated substitution for the consumers since a significant chunk of income
 for most of the population in the developing countries is spent on food.
 However, the problems like segmentation of price - due lack of a cheap
 transport infrastructure and sufficiently large firm sizes - can make the
 analysis of quality particularly challenging.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current study, we attempt to quantify the choice of quality in the
 developing world and view it in relation to the life-style differences
 in the population.
 Instead of focusing on food quality alone, we observe the effect of vast
 differences in life-style that living in urban vs rural areas would bring
 to the consumer in a developing country.
 The sheer lack of availability of certain goods in the rural areas - we
 believe - should also be noted in the consumption of quality.
 We comment on how overall quality may vary with economic inequalities across
 multiple economies as the consumers are faced with the choice of distributing
 their expenditure on quality across the various available commodity groups
 (food, energy etc.).
 This can provide us a better understanding of how quality of consumption
 changes in response to vast economic changes such as urban developments
 or market centralisation - observations that could be of interest both
 from a general demand analysis perspective and from a more specific conspicuous
 consumption perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To observe the quality of consumption with respect to income inequalities
 across the developing countries, we motivate a model for substitution between
 a consumer's long-term needs that are fulfilled with ownership of assets
 or improvement of the socio-economic standing and the consumer's short-term
 needs that are fulfilled with an improved quality of consumption.
 The socio-economic standing of the consumer is determined by a ranking
 order of what we identify as status determinants (income, education, occupation
)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These determinants clearly do not all have the same effect on the long-term
 socio-economic standing of the consumer (i.e.
 education may matter more than occupation etc.).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 while the improvement in quality of expenditure is simply a measure of
 the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC) by the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then attempt to view the distribution of quality (ENDC) across the consumptio
n groups (food, energy, housing etc.) relative to the consumer's long-term
 possessions, identity and skills such as education.
 It is worth emphasising that we differentiate between quality consumption
 and conspicuous consumption in the context of the developing countries.
 At least semantically speaking, the term conspicuous consumption encompasses
 only the exclusive consumption by the rich.
 It is fair to say that there are similarities between the current developments
 in Africa and the rapid economic developments which took place in the United
 States in the late 19th century - when the latter's economy transitioned
 from a vastly agrarian society to an industrialised one.
 However, there are at the same time, also some issues with extending the
 concepts identified by Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

 into the developing markets using the modern economic theory.
 In the environment of the nascent economic transition in sub-Saharan Africa
 where severe economic inequalities are still observed, the options for
 conspicuous consumption are in fact limited to a very small part of the
 population and don't offer the social context of the market forces at work
 in the developing world.
 The quality consumption and possession of long-term assets - on the other
 hand - are concerns for a larger section of the population that contribute
 to a consumer's selection of items for consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status - which motivates conspicuous consumption - is a complex social psycholog
ical phenomenon and even if one views it as part of the long-term utility
 of the consumer, deciding whether an item is a status good or not in the
 developing remains a difficult task.
 For example, if one were to rely only on whether an item can be afforded
 by the rich - then electricity, being used by a small and rich part of
 the population in a sub-Saharan African country like Tanzania, may appear
 to be a status good - at par with weddings which are a clear way of indicating
 status.
 However, whether the same amount of money spent on weddings enhances status
 more than when it's spent on electricity is however a much more difficult
 question to answer and might require us to conduct a survey where we can
 ask the question to the participants.
 Without such a direct survey, determining whether the consumed item provides
 status utility in the long-run would require modeling the complex interactions
 of supply, wealth and social identities in a society.
 Further, status goods themselves change over time - the demand for newly
 introduced items - e.g.
 a smart-phone or a TV- may change as the item of interest moves from being
 a snob type to bandwagon type as the consumer incomes increase over time.
 A static assumption of a set of items being 
\shape italic
conspicuous
\shape default
 thus cannot be relied upon if one wishes to understand the effects of the
 drastic changes in consumer basket.
 In Tanzania, for example, we may be tempted to argue - based on the literature
 on conspicuous consumption - that buying clothes indicates higher status.
 But without observing the effect that getting electricity in the house
 or moving to a bigger house may have on a consumer's long-term utility,
 we cannot assume a significant status-benefit to the consumer from expenditure
 on clothing - since the possibility that those spending on recently installed
 electricity or newly built housing may actually be cutting down on clothing
 expenditure while deriving status from electricity or house ownership cannot
 be ruled out.
 A model for long term utility needs to be considered for any claims on
 status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature on conspicuous consumption often appears more impassioned
 and wide-ranging in its conclusions than a discussion on elasticities of
 a typical demand survey may be.
 We stick to familiar framework of decision making under risk and define
 a narrowed context for status-related consumption in order to attempt explainin
g some of the observations noted in the empirical literature on conspicuous
 consumption.
 In this narrowed context, only a certain measurable criteria that may contribut
e to status are selected.
 Instead of attempting to find the criteria for separating status-items
 from bare-necessities, we have focussed on separating a consumer's short-term
 needs (i.e.
 quality) from her long-term needs (inclusive of long-term durable goods
 - referred to as LTDG in the study and the longer term socio-economic standing
 formed with skills, occupation of the family etc.).
 Neither the measurement of the quality nor of socio-economic standing of
 the consumer seems trivial - since the typical diary and recall methods
 in a survey measure neither one of them.
 Assuming that quality would be priced in the market, we can determine quality
 selected by the consumer by using the prices of the varieties of an item.
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data therefore, eggs and milk are deemed of lower
 quality than goat and beef for proteins.
 Similarly for transport, bicycle is deemed of lower quality than car and
 so on.
 Except for some items that would be missing in the developing country when
 comparing the consumption between two countries, this is a relatively easy
 task.
 For the more difficult task of measuring the socio-economic standing of
 a consumer
\begin_inset Foot

The terms social capital - or status capital are also used in the literature
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, we rely on the measure of socio-economic-status (SES) - which is a standard
 measure of the socio-economic status often used in the sociological and
 health studies.
 The long-term utility of the consumer in the model thus consists of a vector
 of income, education and region/locality/neighborhood as well as the long-term
 durable goods (LTDG) possessed by the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal in the current chapter is not as much to detail the nuances of
 status consumption as it is to show how status-related consumption could
 be viewed in a conventional model for consumer demand.
 An interpretation of status consumption is possible, if we base ourselves
 on the assertion that for status-related consumption to exist, status must
 appear in the long-term utility for the rational consumer in a model.
 In other words, for a rational consumer to spend on status consumption,
 she must see some status utility from consumption in the long-term or the
 short-term.
 We don't attempt to explain to what extent is status a long-term concern
 vs a short-term concern for the consumer.
 Nor do we intend to take an ideological stance on whether status consumption
 is wasteful or a consequence of social mobility.
 Regardless of what items are counted within a certain definition of status
 consumption, we rely on the ability to test if expensive nondurable consumption
 (ENDC) increases with changes towards industrialisation (as seems to be
 the case when reading Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

) or if ENDC is always used to compensate for not having as much status
 and durable goods (LTDG) as others.
 The change in ENDC with respect to price changes could provide further
 details on the structure of quality demand.
 More particularly, if we can measure the sensitivity of ENDC to price-rises,
 we can better assess whether ENDC moves together with measures of social
 mobility in the economy (i.e.
 purchase of assets or an upward movement in education and occupation for
 a member of the household) or if the different economic strata (classified
 in terms of occupation-rank or education levels) continue to spend differently
 on ENDC in face of price changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This basic framework can also be used to compare the long-term demand in
 developing and the developed economies.
 Since the durable goods (LTDG) have a higher upfront cost compared to the
 quality consumption, the accumulation of durable goods (LTDG) is a clearer
 indicator of the consumer's high expectation of the stability of her income
 (if not a real stability of high income).
 To standardise the LTDG options available to the consumer, we can order
 the LTDG in the respective markets based on their costs of acquisition.
 The differences in the costs of two successive LTDG in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cost-order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for LTDG present the substitutability between acquisition of durable goods
 and quality consumption to the consumer.
 A higher difference between two successive LTDG costs is likely to make
 the consumption of quality more tempting for the consumer - whereas low
 differences would make the acquisition of LTDG easier.
 The differences in successive LTDG costs are indeed a consequence of how
 advanced the markets are in an economy.
 In the developing world, we see that the markets are often too underdeveloped
 to make rental options available for an expensive durable good (LTDG) to
 the consumer, the attempts to develop new (cheaper) substitutes to reach
 to the consumer are often inadequate and there is a near absence of credit
 facilities.
 Hence, the differences between successive LTDG costs relative to average
 income is likely to be higher in the developing world than in the developed
 countries (where markets are more developed and either some credit to purchase
 LTDG or a direct rental of LTDG is made available to consumer)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is of course - assuming that all products (at whatever cost) can be
 purchased in the developing world.
 The differences between successive LTDG costs would be significantly lower
 if if the consumer baskets are limited in the developing world through
 trade barriers etc..
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The differences in cost-order thus provide us a way to compare the consumer
 markets between the two economies – and thus to compare the demands (EDNC
 vs LTDG) with respect to the differences in the respective markets.
 The criteria of comparison is planned to be used in the later chapters
 for a comparison across countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sections that follow we explain how comparing quality in expensive
 non-durable consumption with the long-term possessions can provide us a
 way of understanding status-related consumption.
 In Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"

\end_inset

, we survey the literature on status-related consumption and argue how a
 separation between long-term and short-term needs can relate consumption
 with observed social mobility.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"

\end_inset

 discusses a few popular models for demand and their relevance to an econometric
 study of quality - before developing a measure for quality to be used across
 all the commodity groups.
 The subsequent sections discuss the Tanzanian consumption data and the
 conclusions arrived at from a comparison of quality consumption across
 the different asset strata in Tanzania.

\begin_layout Standard
Ever since elasticities were first used in demand analysis, the change in
 needs for commodity groups over time has been of interest to econometricians
 and policy makers.
 Here, both the behavioural and classical approaches seem to find some evidence
 for habit formation in the consumer panel data.
 The measurement of the effect of change in habits and quality on the consumer
 price index has had a long tradition (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment) - from within which Muellbauer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."

\end_inset

 has observed that a model for myopia amongst consumers could explain their
 preferences better.
 In more recent studies where a general setting of the intertemporal substitutio
n problem in a life-cycle context has been used, a rational utility-optimising
 consumer can balance between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned and actual savings over her life-time.
 This is the setting explored by a few behavioural approaches (see Shefrin-Thale

) that have attempted to model the rules of mental accounting used by consumers
 - in order to better understand the conditions that lead to development
 of habits.
 Such models explain the consumers' inertia of choices and allow the representat
ive consumer to be influenced by behavioural factors such as willpower rather
 than letting them become subservient to an optimised plan for life-time
 savings and consumption.
 In what may be seen as a more accurate representation of real-life consumer
 behaviour, the representative consumer in such models is subject to accumulatin
g items that she doesn't need and acquiring habits of consumption she could
 barely afford in the long-term.

A discussion of trends identified in the two threads of literature is possible
 in the context of rapidly-changing developing countries where urban industriali

 urban and rural areas while the status competitions in the society continue
 to thrive.
 Although a detailed time-series of consumption microdata matching the respectiv

, a framework for risk preferences can be used to understand the consumer
 demand in the developing countries.

An important economic model for urban and rural interactions is the Lewis
 model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 - which views urban migration as a necessary phase of development - leading
 to a competition between industrial and agricultural sectors for labour
 and food (it predicts the prices of food to rise as labour moves from agricultu
re to industry).
 The worker/farmer is meant to maximise her income and reduce the risk associate
d with it as she is faced with the choice of migration to the urban areas.
 We argue that the flight to urban areas is often not only an escape from
 despondent circumstances but also an access to expanded consumption basket
 and a chance for improbable social mobilities.
 Therefore, a model that accounts for the competition amongst the individuals
 for status or a place in a perceived social order could provide some refinement
 by adding more incentives to the migration.

 From a behavioural economics perspective, this would amount to a change
 in the reference points for non-food consumption.
 An issue with the use of reference points, however, is their measurement
 in the large-scale microdata.
 Unlike in the controlled settings of an experiment, where the reference
 points can be specified more clearly, they are more difficult to justify
 in the consumption microdata.
 But as long as a separation between the bare necessities and luxuries (i.e.
 a reference point for subsistence) can be justified a framework for measurement
 of consumption can be used to understand the change in needs of a society.

 attempt to answer whether prolonged measures of income equality (and therefore
 stagnant ownership of durable goods) can influence conspicuous consumption
 asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes.
 If the macroeconomic factors and issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) can be controlled for
 in the data, then a general model for long-term (or more stable) needs
 against short-term (or more uncertain) needs could explain the demand pressures
 induced by the income differences in both the developed and developing
 economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a standardisation of demand-influencing factors across the developed
 and the developing would however rest upon a precise definition of the
 long-term utility (inclusive of status) and the consumption associated
 with it.
 Unfortunately the definition for status consumption in the studies we have
 surveyed varies significantly across the social contexts - making the task
 of standardisation nearly impossible.
 For example, some studies include long-term durable goods in the status-related
 items while others don't.
 Others have applied a consumer basket identified from a different economy
 onto the economy being studied.
 Of all the approaches taken towards status consumption we have surveyed,
 we prefer the utility model adopted by Corneo et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 who view snob and bandwagon items as the fundamental types of status goods.
 It is possible - we believe - to link status-related consumption thus defined
 with the consumer decision theory under risk.
 From a behavioural economics perspective, status could encompass the consumer's
 preference to long-term protection and hence a perception of risk associated
 with the promotion to a state of higher income and assets (or any characteristi
c that is perceived to have a higher stability of incomes).
 In the context of consumption-data, we thus fix a certain ontological sense
 of status as the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk or 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability associated with the transition to the highest band of net-worth
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A better model for status would depend on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

influence-area
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 around the individual – since status is inferred from the local context
 of the consumer.
 Our attempt to use the risk in net-worth is by definition to standardise
 the status perceptions at a larger scale (higher level).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A high-status individual is thus someone who has either or both of high
 income and a high (inter-generational) 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability to move towards the high income group (stability).
 In the same ontological sense, a low-status individual is someone who has
 either or both of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 As indicated before, the empirical studies in health and sociological sciences
 often track status in terms of income, education, occupation (see Michelson
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

\end_inset

) - which too easily fits in with our ontological sense of status since
 skills and identity influence the probability of moving towards high-income
 while occupations and income influence the net-worth directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The status-signaling through consumption can be associated with this definition
 as well - since one's consumption is driven not only by how much of a stable
 net-worth (and hence status) one has but also by how much status or future
 expectations of status one may perceive to have.
 The disproportionate expenditure on visible goods - as evidenced by much
 of the literature on conspicuous consumption - can be explained with a
 high 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability of status promotion in our model for status.
 It can be argued that any society where a social order exists would have
 barriers to status associated with income, social identity and the combinations
 thereforth.
 Further, with economic upheavals (e.g.
 the evolution of markets, industrialisation) the poorer social identities
 may try to cross previously imposed barriers through consumption (bandwagon
 effect) while those with richer social identities would attempt to guard
 their status through consumption (snob effect).
 Separating oneself from others through consumption (when all else fails)
 minimises one's own perceived risk (if not the actual risk) of moving away
 from the high-income group.
 Thus, status consumption is likely to exist in any economy where social
 stratification exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Higher status individuals - who are more likely to own long-term durable
 goods (LTDG) and have a 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of staying close to the high-income group - are more likely
 to spend on the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC) as well.
 On the other hand, those with the lower status can indicate net-worth or
 participate in social-ranking only with ENDC.
 The sure way of achieving higher status (in its ontological sense) is to
 increase the chances of staying in the high income group but beliefs in
 the power of social ranking through consumption can transform the subjective
 probability of promotion and hence the ENDC that arises out of it.
 This is because a consumer who believes that she is going to get richer
 would attach less downside risk to the possibility of growth of income
 and of LTDG.
 While we make no explicit attempts to parametrise the role of markets in
 the discussion yet, it hardly needs convincing that the advertising campaigns
 are well aware of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour for lower payoffs
 relative to higher payoffs (and risk-aversion for higher payoffs compared
 to lower) and that the campaigns must play a role in transforming the consumer'
s perceived probability of promotion of her status/net-worth through consumption.
 So even though the LTDG may be surer way to achieve status (simply on grounds
 of higher costs) they require more will-power and patience to accumulate
 whereas ENDC is more affordable and made more accessible through markets.
 By means of an example, a low-income individual may be less likely to buy
 a luxury car in the developed market but may still be willing to compromise
 on other needs if a rental luxury car is made available and advertised
 aggressively through markets.
 There is indeed a plenty of empirical evidence that points to the perceived
 reward for being in the same league as those above in the social order.

How the 
\shape italic
perceived
\shape default
 probability may relate to 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of social mobility is an important question that still remains
 to be answered - but before we address the issue, it is worth emphasising
 just how often the distinction between the 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
and 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probabilities of social mobility is omitted in the popular discourse on
 normative economics.
 The idea that the differences in purchasing power between the sections
 of a society and the desire for mobility amongst them can drive consumption
 and economy dates back at least as far as Adam Smith who had proposed that
 economic progress could be achieved by letting an exchange between the
 rich and poor thrive
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 The stable net-worth model for status where individuals optimise expenditure
 based on future income expectations - may look promising in the sub-Saharan
 African economies too - if one considers that in the post-feudal societies
 all over the world, a promise for social mobility has been of some importance.
 In nearly all the developing countries, we see a new working class having
 replaced the feudal or colonial systems of the century before - developments
 that make one compare the status competitions in the post-war Africa and
 Asia with the rise of middle class in post-medieval Europe (see Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 for a more detailed account of status competitions).
 The competitions amongst the nascent industrial classes for status has
 been a subject of many sociological studies in the late 20th century.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SrinivasSanskritization"

\end_inset

 noted Veblen's pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 in the Indian context (referred to as 
\shape italic
Sanskritization
\shape default
) as the erstwhile lower classes emulated the habits of higher social classes
 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, the habits of the upper economic classes were similarly
 observed to have expanded to the middle and lower classes in the decades
 after the second world war (see Appendix for a survey of the economic history
 of a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The similarities in contexts seem to offer a convincing evidence that believing
 and acting in hopes of social mobility could invariably lead to the development
 in economic institutions and a consequent rise in incomes.
 It may seem therefore that the distinction between the 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
and 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
mobilities is rather unnecessary.
 However, most studies on social-mobility do point to a relevance of social
 identities - particularly in the developing world (arguably where Adam
 Smith's principles were never permitted to thrive).
 Since the changes in political landscape of Africa and Asia have been recent,
 the effects of past political conflicts still reflect themselves into the
 differences in occupational-classes and educational levels.
 In the developing countries, thus both social mobility and consumption
 are influenced by social identities (see Khamis at al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia"

\end_inset

, Kaus

) - whose evolution over time is shaped by factors well outside the realms
 of consumption and income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The segmentation of both demand and status determinants based on social
 identities and region is not the only problem one faces with the use of
 a model where consumers spend on items in the hope for social mobility
 (see Blanden-Machin
\shape italic

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BlandenSocMobility2008"

\end_inset


\shape default
) on the measurement of social mobility based on the life-cycle transition
 in the identified income and occupation groups).
 The dynamics of status - expressed as risk-adjusted net-worth - are in
 fact far more complex and even if we view these dynamics as stochastic
 transition of the status determinants (i.e.
 education, income and identity etc.), the evolution of status (stable net-worth)
 over time - whose expectation is gauged by the consumer's 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability of promotion - remains dependent on unobservable parameters.
 This prevents us from modeling the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
vs 
\shape italic
perceived
\shape default
 probabilities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For such an analysis to make an empirical sense, there are two factors which
 influence the uncertainty in status determinants that ought to be parametrised.
 First is the set of political risks that influence the uncertainty in income
 growth.
 Since both high and low social mobilities are associated with political
 changes, the uncertainty in incomes is less deterministic at high and low
 levels of social mobility.
 It may be possible to assume a particular structure of income growth (an
 approach that is often necessitated due to lack of or poor quality of income
 data - more so in the developing countries), but since the representative
 consumer is assumed to be influenced by the possibility of growth in her
 income, the uncertainty in income growth under political risks must be
 parametrised in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second is the role played by the state and welfare institutions in the transitio
n of status determinants.
 The consumer's expected growth in the educational levels and other status
 determinants are likely to influence consumption - but these determinants
 are essentially public goods i.e.
 the expectation for their growth depends on the strength of the state instituti
ons.
 In the developed world, the state institutions often intervene when market
 forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertakings
 or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 However, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developing
 world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distribution
 of public goods.
 The development of services such as health, education or even electric
 power where a consumer could spend her income is often stalled due to lack
 of a predictable payment structure amongst the customers.
 It may seem ironical then that despite the majority of non-agrarian workforce
 being employed in the private enterprise, one cannot assume perfects markets
 in the developing countries - since the private enterprise receives very
 little governmental assistance and is unable to undertake projects that
 require a higher investment (in relative terms)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This also confirms the conventional wisdom that without the key institutions,
 one cannot assume that more spending on a conspicuous item by the rich
 could benefit the society as a whole.
 The hope that money obtained from the rich on the item could potentially
 fund employment and other opportunities rests upon the institutions being
 strong enough to ensure that the anticipated trickle down effect works.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 When the distribution of assets such as education are assisted by the state,
 the expected risk in levels in education themselves is clearly lowered.
 Thus, how much education eventually matters towards status may depend on
 how consumers set themselves apart in the social order based on other determina
nts of status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't provided by
 the state (as is the case in the developing world), a consumer would associate
 higher risk with the expected growth in education.
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions determines the expectation of accumulation
 of public goods (such as family education level).
 How much education may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect
 of the strength of institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets
 that may provide the expanded consumption choices to the consumer.
 In a model where a consumer optimises the consumption in view of an expectation
 of status promotion, therefore, it is necessary to consider the strength
 of state and welfare institutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issues as above are not uncommon in demand analysis since a model for
 consumer demand often relies on
\shape italic
 ceteris paribus 
\shape default
assumptions on the supply (e.g.
 incomes).
 As long as we can assume that the uncertainty in income and the strength
 of institutions are 
\shape italic
priced
\shape default
 in the market (e.g.
 by assuming that consumers pay fair taxes to sustain state institutions
 etc.), the relationship between consumption and long-term status can still
 be established with the observed-prices of the consumption items in the
 market.
 However conclusions from such a model can only be as strong as the assumption
 of status (or status determinants) being accurately priced in the market
 and the quality of data available on changes in status determinants.
 The approach of interpreting status in terms of tangible measures of status
 determinants such as education or occupation may solve the problem of non-obser
vability of status perceptions, but it doesn't solve the problems of measuring
 how well the countries are governed, how strong their institutions are
 or how much trust exists in the government policies.
 Hence the parameters which govern the expectations of growth in education
 and income would remain intractable.
 Further, if the available data to answer such questions is less reliable
 than the data available on consumption itself, one cannot establish a strong
 relationship between status and consumption.
 The exercise to understand how status determinants influence consumption
 is hardly a futile one but how the micro-structure of consumption influences
 the longer-term development of status is a more complex phenomenon and
 requires us to consider the role of other socio-political factors that
 could be as difficult to measure as the perception of status in the population
 itself.
 In summary, a model that can provide a short-term view of 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probabilities in relation to the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probabilities of social mobility is hardly straightforward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of the literature on status consumption however seems to engage in
 a sort of social commentary without a precise ontological sense of status

 have argued for example that in the post-war developed world, the differences
 between the rich and poor have been reduced to a level that an exchange
 for status and wealth cannot be made lucrative to the poor any more.
 While the level of economic inequalities have indeed narrowed since the
 18th century, the claim that the price of luxuries has exceeded the opportunity
 cost to the rest of the society is more difficult to test empirically.
 Foremost, this is due to the lack of appropriate microdata in the two eras
 but the difficulties are not eased by a lack of clarity on what qualifies
 as a luxury.

The attempts to measure status have not been merely qualitative.
 The earliest econometric attempt to explore the role of status in consumption
 that we know of is due to James Duesensberry 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 who had explained the role of savings rates and security on consumption.
 Similar problems were addressed by the permanent income hypothesis proposed
 by Milton Friedman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"

\end_inset

 - who modeled the consumers' smoothening of income over the expected future
 time periods.
 While challenges were posed to both the relative income and permanent income
 hypotheses, they have provided empirical answers to some important questions
 related to the role of income and class on consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the behavioural approach to status interpreted as the risk-adjusted
 net-asset worth that we have motivated, we now establish how 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probabilities can be related to 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probabilities in the long-term.
 As we have argued before, such a relationship may be as complex as a model
 for the society itself.
 What we have argued so far is that any degree of social mobility would
 ensure that those spending more on higher quality and acquiring more long-term
 durable goods over time have some likelihood of landing up in a higher
 income group (through social interactions).
 While there is no doubt that a consumer has reasons to signal status through
 consumption, the exact relationship between 
\shape italic
the perceived 
\shape default
probabilities (which influence consumption) and the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probabilities (which influence social mobility) would require a reasonable
 model for socio-political changes.
 The measurement of status perception itself is not possible except through
 a direct survey for consumers.
 For a longer-term view, however, it is still possible to differentiate
 between items that are passed on to the next generation and those that
 aren't.
 With the dismal point of view which is characteristic of our discipline,
 we can be sure that in the long-run there is little more than the net asset
 worth of the individual and a probability determined by factors more tangible
 (and measurable) than perception (i.e.
 factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.) that are passed
 over as inheritance and contribute to 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
social mobility.
 Therefore, over generations (i.e.
 in the sufficiently long-term), how individuals perceive themselves matters
 towards status only as long as believing so leads to an 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
growth through net asset worth or the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability associated with the status determinants (e.g.
 skills, education, social identity etc.).
 Status - defined in the long term as the propensity towards net asset worth
 - would completely ignore the habits towards the non-durable consumption
 of the past.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This hinges the much needed separation between the long-term (more stable)
 needs of the consumer from her short-term (more volatile) needs.
 We use this separation as the basis for the difference between 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
and 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
social mobility probabilities.
 Whatever can't be passed on isn't long-term and would not cause any observable
 change in mobility.
 Regardless of how 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability evolves for an individual over a life-time, the 
\shape italic
real 
\shape default
probability is always reset at the start of a life-time.
 The difference between the long-term and short-term needs is also attractive
 from an empirical perspective since the average life-time of a product
 being consumed is a far more objective measure than its status-carrying
 potential.
 Indeed not all high-quality consumption is related to a possible social
 order- some commodity groups are more important for signaling than others
 (we consider these later in the discussion on visibility).
 But all social order - when not dictated by net asset worth and the status
 determinants (education, income, LTDG etc.) must involve some signalling
 though expensive non-durable consumption.
 With a comparison of costlier long-term needs against short-term non-durable
 needs, we can see how the long-term expectations may influence consumers
 under the different socio-economic strata

In the current chapter we therefore attempt to measure how consumers may
 balance their long-term and short-term needs as the market introduces new
 durable goods and the improved quality over time.
 In a later chapter, we extend this model under life-cycle assumptions in
 a time-series formulation where a consumer's planned consumption can differ
 from the actual consumption.
 The perceptions of consumers do not serve as an input to the current model
 - and hence no attempt is made to measure status or to model self-evaluation
 of the consumers in the study.
 Instead, we focus on how the demand for quality and long-term durable goods
 evolves when subjected to changes in supply of items, their price and rise
 in consumer incomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we've argued before, to say that the long-term dynamics of status determinant
s are complex is not to say that consumption isn't shaped by status (stable
 net-asset-worth in the ontological sense).
 Hence we argue against the use of the deterministic models of demand for
 status consumption - as the rational consumer has no reason to engage in
 any status related consumption (neither in short-term nor in long-term)
 when she knows all about her future plans.
 As Thaler et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

 had argued in their influential paper on a behavioural life-cycle hypothesis,
 there should be no overeating and overspending if the consumers were rational.
 If there is indeed nothing to be gained by status-related consumption (the
 assumption of conspicuous consumption being essentially futile - as was
 argued by Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

), then there is no way for the rational consumer to derive any utility
 from status-related consumption.
 However, the mere existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there
 is some utility to be derived by spending on status.
 Whether the consumers do so due to habits, myopia or longer-term expectation
 of status is a difficult question that we don't attempt to answer by studying
 of consumer data (and it is not needed for any revealed preference analysis).
 It is nevertheless possible to measure how the consumer balances her short-term
 expectations vs long-term expectations in the presence of factors that
 may determine status in the long-term and this shall be attempted in the
 current chapter.

 The model uses a visibility factor to argue that the perception of one's

 As long as conspicuous consumption exists - one can argue that the visibility

 visible utility by observing consumption.
 The visibility factor based approach allows consumers to spend on

 While this approach has its merits, we find the assumption of status being
 derived from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

futile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items too strong for empirical purposes in a more general study of inequalities
 and quality in the developed and the developing economies (see Ustuner

 The futility assumption makes less sense in the developing world 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 where there are far fewer exclusive conspicuous items and the expenditure
 on conspicuous items is limited to a much smaller portion of the population.
 More importantly, since an item provides advantages both through visibility
 and quality, the visibility-based empirical classification of status-items
 in the developed world itself is fraught with problems (escaped only through
 a consumer survey of one's own).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of deciding on a crisp boundary between visible and non-visible
 utilities, we focus on the quality defined as expensive non-durable consumption
 (ENDC - which prices status or visible benefits and signals elitism) and
 ownership of long-term durable goods (LTDG - which signal that it'll take
 longer for others to acquire a particular costly item).
 Visibility is relevant to both ENDC and LTDG.
 Our focus on quality criteria rather than visibility thus is not intended
 to diminish the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption but only to include the latter in a wider model for status
 and income.
 Visibility does contribute to status and therefore utility to the consumer
 - but one also needs to relate visible consumption with the underlying
 economic variables that may drive status (or utility) in the long-run.
 By means of an analogy, let's consider the market for cars where status
 is signalled through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption might tell us that the consumers
 pay more attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would like to see primarily - i) the constraints on
 occupation and income that exist in the respective areas and ii) the price
 differences in the cars being sold in the market.
 In our original problem of status consumption, while it is true that individual
s spend more on their outward appearances (despite controlling for everything
 else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not all what status
 consumption may comprise of (see the Figure

 for the terminology around status consumption).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we detail in the later sections, visibility can be viewed in relation
 to the consumer's preference order of commodity groups for quality.
 In the different separable commodity groups we identify for consumption,
 we assume that the consumer adjusts quality based on a preference order
 over the commodity groups - e.g.
 a consumer may consider quality for transport more important than quality
 in food (or vice versa).
 When prices change, the consumers are assumed to maintain a pecking order
 of quality which they compromise on or overspend on.
 Note however that such an order matters for any two selected items only
 if they are in different commodity groups.
 For the items within the commodity group, a preference based on visibility
 doesn't exist in the model.
 For example, in the Tanzanian LSMS data where we identify five categories
 - Food, Energy, Transport, Household and Social Functions, visibility may
 not have much of a role to play within each of the commodity groups even
 though the consumers may consider the quality in one group more important
 than in the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the current model for long-term and short-term needs does not
 view status consumption as futile but relates it with an expectation of
 social mobility - which is influenced more with long-term possessions than
 non-durable consumption.
 In terms of the model, an identity (religious, racial etc.) may carry status
 only through a history of past LTDG ownership, incomes/occupations (a criterion
 that may allow us to quantify the role of identity in status).
 The model doesn't attempt to track evolution of status - but is only interested
 in how consumption can change under different strata of status - by focusing
 only on long-term utility through accumulation of durable goods and the
 short-term utility of quality of quality in non-durable consumption apart
 from the fulfillment of general needs.

\begin_layout Standard
We start with demonstrating that a simple formulation such as that of Stone-Gear
y utility for all commodity groups would be inadequate to discuss utility
 through quality.
 The optimisation of Stone-Geary direct utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum\beta_{i}log(q_{i}+\gamma_{i})$

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\beta_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 under the conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

 gives us the indirect utility function
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The first-order conditions for the Lagrangean 
\begin_inset Formula $L=u-\lambda(x-p\cdot q)=\sum\beta_{i}log(q_{i}+\gamma_{i})-\lambda(x-p\cdot q)$
\end_inset

 lead to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}=0\Rightarrow\frac{\beta_{i}}{q_{i}}=\lambda p_{i}\forall i\in[1,n]$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}q_{i}}=\lambda\forall i\in[1,n]$
\end_inset

.
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\beta_{i}=1\Rightarrow\lambda=1/x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}=\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}x$
\end_inset

u\equiv\psi(x,p) & =\sum\beta_{i}log(x\beta_{i}/p_{i}+\gamma_{i})
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The econometric methods corresponding to the indirect utility can be easily
 devised if one assumes that the consumer observes the price index of an
 item whose many variants exist in the market.
 However since a better quality item is set to be more expensive than the
 less quality item, a switch to higher quality by the consumer is inseparable
 in the model from an increase in the price-index of the item whose multiple
 variants exist in the market.
 The increase in the price-index of an item (regardless of whether it's
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shift -so that the relative price structure of the variants remains the
 same or not) only implies the consumer would reduce the quantity consumed
 of the item.
 We may still use the model if we assume that the individual's quality preferenc
es are fixed - but a change in quality due to price cannot be studied with
 the model as such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the usual limitations of an additive utility function such as Stone
 Geary indeed also apply.
 But the goal of demonstrating the unsuitability of this function is only
 to argue that an explicit measure of quality is necessary in either the
 direct utility or the cost-function for us to interpret meaningful results
 for quality using the corresponding econometric method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Substitution between Quality and Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the model for long-term and short-term needs in the current
 chapter is to measure the distribution of the quality of consumption and
 the ownership of assets throughout the population.
 The items of high-quality can exist in every category and while they are
 not assumed be equivalent, there may be some substitution amongst them
 (kobe beef cannot be substituted with a luxury travel as is - but a high
 standard of life can be indicated by either or both of them).
 Due to the assumptions of seperability and substitution within the broad
 commodity groups of food, energy, transport etc., we do not consider the
 consumption on a group of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high-quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items as a separate commodity group (which is indeed the route taken by
 the studies in conspicuous consumption for the simplicity it brings when
 combined with the assumption of futility of conspicuous consumption).
 Instead of purchasing overall quality, we consider how consumers put some
 weight on higher-quality within each commodity group ( i.e.
 the portion of total expenditure spent on the expensive non-durable consumption
) based on their tastes and prices of higher quality in every category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we consider an environment of stable prices i.e.
 if we ignore the effect of price changes for a moment, then the distribution
 of ENDC weights may change when the individuals acquire long-term durable
 goods and spend on their upkeep and maintenance costs or as they give up
 on hopes of acquiring costlier LTDG (possibly due to other needs).
 It is assumed that a consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality
 (there is little evidence of that in the data) - therefore when prices
 are stable, a rise in expensive nondurable consumption must come either
 from an increase in income or from depletion of savings (sale of long-term
 durable goods).
 Likewise, a drop in ENDC must be due to purchase of LTDG, addressing of
 more urgent needs or a drop in income (when price are stable).
 We assume that the rational consumers in our model hope to increase either
 LTDG ownership or ENDC at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the environment of stable prices, the consumption is influenced by long-term
 expectations - which is measured in the model as a vector of occupation,
 education, region (locality, neighborhood) and LTDG.
 Since income, occupation and education are fixed in the short-run, what
 changes most often is the acquisition of LTDG that are available in the
 market if the needs of the consumer haven't changed.
 Whenever long-term durable goods are purchased, the consumer must undergo
 a change in the weight of the quality in the consumption categories if
 i) her needs (including status needs) haven't changed (status can only
 be indicated through LTDG ownership or ENDC) ii) if she is not saving for
 another asset (the consumer is more likely to spend on quality if she doesn't
 have more long-term durable goods planned to purchase in the future) .
 We assume that except for the change brought about by LTDG or needs, a
 consumer does not change her taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we now turn to the effect of price changes, then we must consider the
 price of quality in the various groups and that the quality in one category
 may be substituted with quality in another.
 Such a substitution may not be perfect (as is required in a simple-repackaging
 approach) but a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport
 to food or vice versa - driven by change in prices, LTDG ownership or needs.
 To illustrate this substitution with an example, consider a middle-income
 family that cuts down on expenses (due to loss of income) by moving to
 a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants are
 fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place - so the consumption would either
 shift to saving for a better car (LTDG) or improve quality in some other
 category (better jewelry, better schooling for kids etc.) - assuming the
 needs of the family except indicated by the number of family members haven't
 changed (including what one may call the status needs of the consumer).
 In the case of the switch in the commodity group where a higher quality
 was preferred, the price of high quality (fine-dining) seemed too high
 for the food category.
 This example of the switch also illustrates that the difference between
 needs and status-needs is not a concern for our model - as the model only
 observes the differences between high-price and low-price consumption in
 the same group - assuming that the essential needs are independent of the
 wealth of the consumer
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The difference between needs and non-needs may seem critical to some for
 any study on status-related consumption.
 However, the issue is only a semantical one since our view of needs is
 only that of basis needs.
 Any non-essential needs are interpreted in terms of quality (ENDC) and
 assets (LTDG).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the example, therefore, one could proxy the needs of the family with
 simply the number of family members and their age.
 In terms of the model, notice that the difference between the status of
 a rich and a poor family is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general status-need
 for the family to maintain quality across all categories - a task that
 is better afforded with higher income.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by expensive
 non-durable consumption and possession of LTDG in all commodity groups
 - driven by wealth and income of the consumer (rather than high-class or
 low-class needs of the consumer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a time-series formulation of the model is postponed until a later
 chapter, it is worth reiterating that the expensive nondurable consumption
 (ENDC) weights do not contribute to status over a long-period of time -
 the long-term utility is influenced only by inheritable LTDG purchases
 and the occupation-education-region vector.
 We maintain the view that status - in its ontological sense - is not changed
 with short-run purchases - even though the planning for high-status over
 the life-time and the attempts to get into a rich-club can be indicated
 by a disproportionately high expenditure on high quality consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This view also supports the idea that faced with a choice of fulfillment
 of essential needs and higher quality, one would reduce the quality immediately.
 Needs to meet a particular calorie-quota for energy are indeed more important
 than consuming electricity 
\shape italic
per se
\shape default
.
 However, there is both myopia and inertia in the choices - therefore a
 consumer is likely to switch to electricity or better meat when she receives
 a higher income and has propensity to stick to these choices when the prices
 increase.
 In a times-series analysis, the consumption in the next cycle would thus
 depend on the current ownership of assets and the current quality.
 In addition to the state of the consumer, such demands are shaped also
 by the introduction of LTDG and high-quality products.
 The distribution of quality across commodity groups is the subject of the
 next subsection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these issues are to be revisited when formulating a time-series model
 of ownership in a later chapter, it is worth highlighting how of supply
 issues can be parametrised in a comparison between any two countries.
 The parametrisation comes through the normalisation of the consumer basket
 - while we can identify a fixed number of commodity groups in the consumption
 data in a selected country, we should recognise that the quality variation
 may not exist in the market for a certain commodity group in one country
 while it does in the other.
 For example, in Tanzania - the car rental market is small and the variation
 in the quality of cars being sold may be smaller than in a typical city
 in the developed world.
 It is clear that when quality variation is not observed in a commodity
 groups, only the relevant LTDG in the group can bring status.
 Thus, the unavailability of the quality variation in the category would
 either increase the savings for the next available LTDG in the commodity
 group or increase the quality consumption in some other commodity group
 (assuming status needs remain the same).
 These 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jumps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in quality - we argue - are what make for the differences in life-style
 between the developed and the developing countries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Substitution in quality across commodity groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before formulating the specifics of our model, we explain why a model for
 quality-substitution depends on a measure for quality applicable across
 all commodity groups.
 We then explain the other level of substitution that associates the ownership
 of long-term durable goods (LTDG) with quality.
 Explaining why neither a two-state budgeting model nor a simple-repackaging
 model would be suitable for this substitution, we then motivate a discrete
 model for utility for the substitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When prices or needs change, the consumers who observe quality variants
 in commodity groups would cut back on overall quality by switching to either
 cheaper quality within each group or by cutting back quality in one group
 to increase in another.
 The quality substitution within the commodity group is relatively easy
 to measure but for one to observe the quality substitution across multiple
 commodity groups, we would need a generic method for measuring quality
 across all commodity groups.
 This may further help determine how consumers switch between commodity
 groups for quality over time.
 It may be possible - eventually - to consider a preference order of commodity
 groups which is used by the consumer to cut back on quality as the incomes
 fall or prices rise
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It could be of further interest to see how such a preference order of commodity
 groups compares with the order of visible commodity groups obtained in
 experiments.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is tempting to view this quality-substitution with a two-state budgeting
 model - which is based on a hierarchy of separable needs and is commonly
 used in the literature on household demand.
 To proceed with this model, one may consider the proportion of expenditure
 on high quality in every commodity group for every consumer (let's say
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},...,\lambda_{c}...,)$
\end_inset

 ) - a vector that can be written as a function on the consumers LTDG ownership
 and long-term needs (number of children, age etc.).
 Here, one can then measure how the quality substitution (the complementarity
 or supplementarity) between the commodity groups changes in response to
 the prices of the commodities.
 However, a key condition for the tree-like structure for the two-state
 budgeting model is that the relative demand between two items in any two
 different categories changes only as response to the total expenditure
 (i.e response to price changes and total expenditure changes must use the
 same channels of communication in the commodity tree
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer,StrotzUtilityTree1957"

\end_inset

).
 It turns out that this is impossible to guarantee if we claim that quality
 can be substituted from across the commodity groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the issue with the two-state budgeting approach, let's consider
 a two-group world of food and energy - within which we have items beef-bread-mi
lk and electricity-kerosene-charcoal respectively.
 If consumers don't cut back on quality in one group to gain quality in
 another, the items - food and energy - can be assumed (and tested empirically)
 to be separable groups - since it is plausible for a consumer to allocate
 some money 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy respectively in the first-stage (based on her knowledge
 of the price-indices for food and energy).
 Once the expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 are fixed, the (representative) consumer can subsequently decide in the
 second-state how much of kerosene or electricity to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and how much beef or bread to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Individual prices of every item within the category would decide which
 food varieties and which energy sources are to be purchased.
 Under the conditions of weak separability, it is implied that cheaper bread
 (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose
 a more expensive fuel (price-sensitivity for electricity, charcoal etc.
 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

 for details on the theory).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This condition - however - falls apart if we introduce the substitution
 for quality across the commodity groups.
 More particularly, if we assume that a consumer gets quality utility from
 using electricity and from eating beef interchangeably
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There may be indeed a preference to quality from electricity than quality
 from beef for the same expenditure.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, then having decided on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 does not guarantee that she would not switch to more consumption on electricity
 if kobe beef becomes cheaper.
 This is because overall quality - due to our assumption - is aggregated
 from across the commodity groups.
 Thus unlike in the case of energy and food without quality substitution
 across commodity-groups, cheaper food can be compensated with the switch
 to electricity.
 If we have set ourselves to test the presence of such a substitution across
 commodity groups, we cannot assume that it simply doesn't exist.
 If price sensitivities and total expenditure sensitivities don't follow
 the same channel of communication in the two-state budgeting tree - then
 the necessary condition for two-stage separability is not met (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

) - and so even though a tree-structure could present a relevant view of
 the hierarchy of commodity groups, we cannot accept the model due to the
 weak separable condition on overall quality
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While quality is substitutable across multiple commodity groups, one can
 also argue that quality consumption across categories must move together
 - thus there is no perfect substiutability in quality from multiple commodity
 groups 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rejection of the weak separability also clarifies the dependence of
 LTDG ownership on the high quality consumption in every commodity group
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},...,\lambda_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 As such, there are two ways of expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 as a function of LTDG ownership - first is to include LTDG from across
 all commodity groups in the function and the second is to consider the
 LTDG in only the commodity group 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 where the high quality consumption is being observed.
 The first option assumes that durable goods influence quality consumption
 in every group while the latter introduces separability amongst owned durable
 goods as well.
 If a consumer ought to balance the the overall quality with the LTDG ownership,
 the latter option is a particularly limiting one.
 With a preference to the former option and noticing the range of products
 in the consumer surveys, we formalise the substitution of overall quality
 and the LTDG ownership by introducing the following condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series bold
C.1
\series default
 There are only two types of commodity groups - one where LTDG exist and
 one where they don't exist.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A strong distinction between the two types of commodity groups simplifies
 our model of consumer demand.
 With this condition, there are only two ways a consumer can spend on short-term
 consumption - either by switching between the variants of an item (choosing
 higher or lower quality of a composite good) or spending more on an elementary
 good (where quality variation doesn't exist).
 For example, since quality variation doesn't exist in transport and housing
 data in the Tanzanian survey, the consumer is assumed to spend on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elementary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 short-term consumption instead of saving for a LTDG (if the LTDG exist
 in a group).
 Another way to see this is that the elementary short-term consumption in
 the commodity groups where LTDG exist competes with the group where quality
 variation exists - for the consumer's money.
 The goal of the comparison of ENDC with LTDG is thus to compare the consumer's
 respective short-term needs and long-term needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that only either ENDC or LTDG can dominate in a category (i.e.
 the condition C.1) risks ignoring some quality differences when LTDG too
 have quality variation.
 For example, if several types of cars exist in the transport commodity
 group as do the limousine companies for a taxi-commute, then C.1 would ignore
 the quality variation in either one of them.
 To ensure that the quality differences amongst LTDG are not ignored when
 there are quality difference in the non-durable consumption within the
 same category where C.1 is assumed, we impose another relevant condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
C.2 Acquiring long-term durable goods (LTDG) is always more expensive than
 engaging in the higher quality or expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirically, this condition is not as problematic as it may at first appear.
 For example, there are no LTDG in the food category (or energy) that could
 matter for the long-term utility for the consumer while the quality consumption
 in housing is made irrelevant by the high (relative) price of housing.
 Even in the taxi vs cars example above, we can ignore the quality variation
 in limousine-companies as long as C.2 is satisfied.
 This is not to say that a model with quality variation amongst LTDG is
 not possible (a consumer can choose between types of housing for example)
 - only that for us to consider the quality differences in a commodity group
 (e.g.
 housing), we would need to relieve the assumption that only one of LTDG
 or ENDC can matter in commodity group (unless one views housing too as
 non-durable consumption).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Tanzanian data, where we identify the commodity groups - food, energy,
 household and transport, it's only food and energy where only quality matters
 (the saving for future is ruled out with non-durable consumption).
 Further, food is the only group where we have quantity consumed recorded
 - and thus the quality of protein, carbohydrates, beverages etc.
 - each of which is treated as a composite good - is easy to determine.
 We treat household and transport, on the other hand, as elementary goods
 (i.e.
 no quality variation is assumed).
 Thus we can measure the overall quality (or other short-term consumption)
 in comparison with the savings for future purchase of LTDG in an environment
 where new goods are supplied and the expectations for future income growth
 change over time.
 The measures for quality for the composite and elementary goods are as
 follows:

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have discussed two levels of substitution - the first is between
 quantity and quality in every commodity group and the second between the
 short-term and long-term needs.
 These become easy to integrate due to the conditions C.1 and C.2.
 Specifically when commodity groups are dominated either by LTDG or by ENDC,
 the substitution between long-term and short-term becomes the quality substitut
ion between the commodity groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's illustrate this with an example : consider a two commodity-group world
 where prices are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{1}^{2},p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for group 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{1},p_{2}^{2},p_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for group 2.
 Assuming the price are in an ascending order, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{2}^{1}$
\end_inset

 are the prices of the cheapest commodity in each group and can be considered
 the base-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively .
 Assume for a moment that the consumer's income remains constant.
 Notice also that one of the preconditions of the quality-measure we've
 adopted (i.e.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 which is due to the composite commodity theorem

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Now if price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 increases and the quantities consumed of the item with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 remain the same, then for the total expenditure in group 1 (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

) to remain the same, the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 must decline (i.e.
 less of the items with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be consumed).
 If the consumer doesn't decrease the quantities consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1},q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=p_{1}^{1}q_{1}^{1}+p_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{3}q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 would increase due to rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer must adjust 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=p_{2}^{1}q_{2}^{1}+p_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{3}q_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - since her total income remains the same.
 It is possible, therefore, that the consumer spends less on food overall
 - for example - to support her energy needs.
 The switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be the first-level of substitution while the switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 would constitute the second-level of substitution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's see how our assumption changes the problem.
 Consider the case when the group 2 is comprised only of elementary goods
 with the just one price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and a set of long-term durable goods whose price is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

>>
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 (LTDG) .
 In that case, the first-level of substitution would be applicable only
 for group 1 and the second-level of substitution would be driven only by
 the savings for the long-term durable good in the group 2 (with price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 Thus under C.1 and C.2, certain commodity groups being dominated by LTDG
 and others by ENDC associate the second-level of substitution with the
 LTDG ownership in the model.
 It's easy to see that increases in incomes i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2}$
\end_inset

 do not change the substitution much differently from how change in prices
 would.

As the idea of simple repackaging requires perfect substitution, its applicabili

 As an example the switch from kerosene to electricity is far more than
 an improvement of quality in

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with base-price of kerosene and makes the expression of electricity consumption
 in terms of the quantity and price of kerosene consumed somewhat of a stretch.
 To proceed, one must consider how using electricity would change the utility
 for food (with refrigerator), household consumption (hair-dryers) etc..
 The classical approach taken by Fisher and Shell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 recommends adjusting the prices of the final goods i.e.
 by decomposing utilities in a way that quality-change can be traced to
 all composite goods whose quality is affected by the particular commodity
 (e.g.
 electricity).
 This may sound rather cumbersome, but the issue can in fact be mitigated
 if there were a recursive tree-like hierarchy of the items such as refrigerator
s that improve the quality of other goods.
 With a tree-like structure, one needs to only look at the nodes of the
 trees i.e.
 adjust the price of all food items whose quality is improved.
 In addition to adjusting the price for energy, therefore one would also
 adjust the price for food.
 It is indeed possible to write separable utility functions for all such
 node items whose quality is enhanced.
 It is clear, however, that price-adjustment for electricity would need
 to go beyond the energy-commodity-group.
 Apart from that, one would also need a detailed historical price information
 for all commodities in the context whose quality is changed due electricity
 for such a tree-structure to be set up

We now comment on the form of the utility function for the consumer.
 As we have mentioned before, the individuals net-asset worth which tracks
 status is proxied by income, education, occupations, regional/social identity
 and the long-term possessions.
 Believing that there is a probability of promotion of self-evaluation by
 an expensive non-durable expenditure (denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

) is modeled with a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 which controls the ENDC.
 Hence the consumer optimises the utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\kappa,A,\eta)$
\end_inset

 in the short-term where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 denotes the long-term possession, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the quantity consumed driven by needs of the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 denotes the quality of consumption associated with the stochastic function
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of this probabilistic model, those investing in higher-education
 for their children, for example, would accumulate possessions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to increase the likelihood of higher status for their children and have
 a different value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 from those who don't.

As we are concerned primarily with a cross-sectional study in the current
 chapter, we postpone the details of the probabilistic model until a later
 chapter when a time-series formulation is developed.
 In the current chapter, we focus viewing how ENDC varies across different
 strata of LTDG and income.
 Based on the model for long-term utility, there are two supply-side factors
 that should be observed for such a comparison

 In a more traditional model, one would discount the projections of savings
 and non-durable consumption subject to a wealth constraint - and associate
 a stochastic component to the consumers decisions.
 The model we use is based on McFadden's approach where utility is decomposed
 into a systematic component and a random component i.e.
 a decision maker chooses and option 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 amongst 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 alternatives where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}=V_{i}+\epsilon_{i}$

 Here,

McFadden's is essentially a technique to model the discrete choice of a
 consumer.
 In our case, whether the consumer saves for purchasing an asset or not
 is the discrete choice - particularly so because the savings rate of the
 consumer is an unobserved variable.
 In a time-series formulation we may use a general stochastic form of this
 process and associate it with the probability of acquiring assets

 to purchase and asset or not.
 The asset states that the consumer enters in are - the low band, the medium-low

 order we have talked about in the previous sections.

Let the utility of the consumer be

 A key argument here is that the tendency to expand one's needs also adds
 to the felicity (utility) of the consumer.
 That the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 and quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$

 also increases with respect to needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 relies on the life-cycle hypothesis - which considers how an individual
 obtains a stable income before expanding her family and sheds off assets
 acquired over the active years - enabling the further generations to replicate
 that same behaviour.

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 choice of purchasing an asset while getting a non-stochastic utility from
 quality of consumption.

\paragraph_spacing single
Tanzania is the first country to be analysed in the study.
 With recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, the country
 provides a much desired snapshot of the consumer world of developing sub-Sahara
n Africa.
 The data chosen for the preliminary analysis is from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) conducted by the World Bank.
 LSMS includes expenditure microdata from about 10,000 households - with
 many of the expenditure categories of potential status significance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Tanzanian LSMS data is richer for the food expenditure - which is recorded
 with a greater level of detail than other expenditures.
 As market prices are recorded for food items, we check how the higher budget
 shares are associated with choice of higher price items(see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mean_prices"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mean_budget_shares"

\end_inset

) .
 We find that the consumption of highest prices items doesn't always result
 in higher budget shares.
 Tea and coffee don't form the highest budget shares (while they are expensive).
 Items that are of high price and have low budget shares while having cheaper
 substitutes in the market qualify for the expensive non-durable consumption
 criteria for quality.
 Other descriptive statistics measure, e.g.
 the skewnesss of total expenditure on the item can also hint whether only
 a small proportion of population gets to spend more on the item.
 Noticeably, the budget share on skin-cream etc.
 - which we may have normally associated with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption - is quite low.
 The variance on the consumption of skin-cream is in fact lower than that
 for bread or milk.
 The budget shares for cigarettes seem quite high (and quite skewed) - however,
 since there are no cheaper substitutes available we don't consider cigarettes
 as part of status consumption.
 Although the descriptive statistics seem to confirm the heuristic that
 amongst many substitutable items, the distribution of expensive varieties
 is more likely to be skewed, it is worth emphasising that neither skewness
 nor mean-cost is used as a criteria to pick items for status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The substitution between items drives our classification of food item -
 goat and meat are put under the same group - but not tea and coffee - because
 there is little sense in substitution between tea/coffee and goat/meat.
 The food category is in fact divided into sub-categories so that demands
 within the category can be considered separable but still lump together
 the substitutes that are of value for quality.
 Instead of having to put tea,coffee with goat,beef in high-price food categorie
s for quality, we consider put consider the high quality consumption in
 the sub-categories beverages and protein.
 Similarly, instead of classifying beef, pork and goat as varieties of meat,
 we group them together with milk products, lentils and eggs as sources
 of protein - since we view the latter as cheaper sources of protein.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recall method is particularly volatile in developing countries where
 regular payment setups are hardly a norm.
 We must be careful therefore with interpreting differences in the budget
 share over snapshots (2008,2010 and 2012) for a particular household -
 as the household may not have expenditures in all three instances of the
 survey.
 For cases such as electricity in Tanzania, we find the survey field for
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main lighting fuel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 more reliable for the test of electricity consumption than the last expenditure
 on electricity (note that kerosene is much cheaper than electricity in
 Tanzania).
 Such matters can be made worse in cases of expenditure where seasonality
 (time of the year) is also an important factor.
 To address the issue, therefore, we are careful not to draw any conclusions
 from a household's expenditure over the time-series (i.e.
 survey snapshots in 2008, 2010 and 2012) - but rely only on the average
 expenditure by a collection of households (in a particular region etc.)
 over time.

 on tribal identities and regional migration.
 In absence of this data (as is the case with LSMS used in the study), we
 consider other proxies that may be correlated with social identities (e.g.
 family income levels, language spoken, locality etc.

 We only consider district level residence and primary spoken language as
 the demographic factors that may affect consumption.

 developments) that has seen expansions in the areas of micro-credit as

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantl
y.
 One way to adjust the quantity consumed is by estimating the storage using
 the number of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of rooms as such.
 Another way to test for store-and-consumption pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs - which could be because the market as described
 in the survey is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate
 region).
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we observe the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Since the store-and-consume habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

, it influences both influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

 and is endogenous.
 A reasonable assumption we make is that the percentage of stockpilers does
 not change significantly with the regions.
 In any two regions A and B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively therefore, we would have
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reason to believe
 that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 In this analysis, region dummies only appear significant for more populous
 regions and the effect of household-size dominates even if we resample
 the data in smaller samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travel-costs on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that stockpili
ng is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wider categories of food, energy, transport and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.

\begin_layout Section
Results

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of our analysis is to see how long-term status needs of the consumers
 - fulfilled with purchase of assets (which translates into an upward movement
 in status in the model) - relate with the short-term needs that are fulfilled
 with expensive non-durable consumption.
 Much the way we were wary of claiming that consumption on items indicates
 perception of status hierarchies, we don't claim that the observed social
 mobility - recorded in this way - serves as a measure of how status is
 perceived in society.
 The variation in the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC) across occupation
 ranks, education, social identities and the assets owned across the economy
 tell us to what extent the consumers may overweigh on quality instead of
 owning long-term durable goods (LTDG).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that our model doesn't require that a consumer purchase a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

composite item
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of quality (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities"

\end_inset

 for details of the approach).
 Instead, we believe that quality is a concern for the researcher - not
 for the consumer (see the clarification from Nelson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

) who merely exercises her (discrete) choice given the set of products available
 in the market for given prices.
 With that caveat, we use the conditions C1 and C2 - noting that quality
 is of significance only in food and energy.
 The presence of assets in household (housing, land) and transport (cars)
 makes the consumption under transport and household (carpets, building
 material etc.) elementary.
 The expenditures recorded in the diary and the assets that the consumer
 can own are shown in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:AssetsKey"

\end_inset

.
 The measure for quality for elementary goods i.e.
 groups where there are no quality differences (transport, housing) - is
 simply the logarithm of the total expenditure - while for non-elementary
 or composite goods, the quality is calculated as described in the Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The quality measures serve as the control variables in the regression

The dependent variable in the regression indicates the band of assets in
 the cost order that consumer belongs to be (based on assets owned) - i.e.
 a discrete variable indicating whether the person owns a low, medium-low,
 medium-high or high-value asset.
 These 4 values are referred to as the variable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The non-stochastic control variables comprise of the observed quality differenc

\begin_inset Formula $q_{energy},q_{protein}.q_{starch},q_{fat},q_{beverages},q_{fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{household}),log(x_{transport})$
\end_inset

 (the logarithm of total expenditure in the category) and the variables
 for household characteristics: occupation, region, language(s) spoken,
 household-size, highest education level of the household head as well as
 the age of the household head.
 An explanation for all the control variables is provided in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

As an example of the measurement of the quality-related control variables,
 note that the quality of starch is a price-ratio weighted average of the
 quantities of starch - i.e.
 mass consumed of the following items - rice_husked, rice_paddy, maize_green,
 maize_grain, maize_flour, millet_grain, millet_flour, wheat, bread, bunscakes,
 pasta, othercereal, cassava_fresh, cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam and
 potatoes.
 The price-ratio (or the relative price structure) is calculated simply
 by dividing the price (per kg) of each commodity in the group with the
 cheapest starch (based on price per kg) in the market.
 For example, if the price of rice_husked and wheat were 5£/kg and 7£/kg
 respectively, then for a household that consumes 1 kg of rice_husked and
 2 kg of wheat, the quality metric would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1\times7/5+2\times1}{1+2}=1.13$
\end_inset

 (assuming risk_husked is the cheapest starch).
 The quality metrics are calculated similarly for protein, beverages etc..

We have ordered a few control variables to assist conclusions from the regressio

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable listed in the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 ranges from 0 to 3 where 0 denotes poor, 1 denotes low, 2 denotes middle
 3 needs high - income occupations.
 Similarly, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

education_rank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable ranges from 1 to 4 indicating the order of education level obtained
 by the head of the household (4 is highly educated, 1 is less educated).
 The dependent variable in the regression is denoted as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

band_general
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - which ranges from 1 to 4.
 The high value of the band_general indicates an owner of expensive assets
 while low value of the variable indicates and owner of the cheaper assets.
 More particularly, 4 denotes high-asset ownership, 3-mediumhigh, 2-mediumlow
 and 1-low (base case).
 The dy/dx values (see the Appendix for the STATA commands used) indicate
 the discrete changes from the base case (low asset ownership) - i.e.
 transition from the base of low-asset ownership group (band_general=1)
 to the respective group (band_general=2,3 or 4).

 and Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 show that medium-high assets seem limited to the cities.
 But the overall effect of having these assets seems to depend more on other
 factors.
 So while households in the rural areas do miss out on ownership of the
 medium-assets available in the cities - being in urban areas doesn't change
 the ownership of assets significantly.
 To infer the relative effect of control variables, we rely on the margins
 analysis results from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:margins_probit"

\end_inset

.
 The consumption on quality on starch and fruits-vegetables is particularly
 interesting.
 It seems that the high-asset owners spend on quality in starch but not
 as much in the fruits and vegetables.
 This could simply be because the varieties in starch - which can be stored
 for longer than fruits-vegetables in the processed form - are consumed
 at a higher price (processed) by the asset-rich in the urban areas.
 The same is not seen for fruits and vegetables.
 The protein, fat and beverage quality does not seem to vary significantly
 across the asset ownership bands (implying that all asset owner categories
 seem to consume meat and expensive protein varieties).

The effect of education seems to matter for being in the high-asset owner
 group (i.e.
 either education is more accessible to the asset-rich or that it is a surer
 way to become asset-rich - a distinction that cannot be made without the
 panel-data analysis).
 Although age is statistically significant for band 3 and 4, it has a rather
 weak economic effect.
 The significance of household size seems to indicate that the needs do
 reflect themselves in asset ownership - since larger families seem to own
 more assets.
 However, this effect too is rather weak.
 The litlang variable (the language spoken) does not seem statistically
 significant - implying that the asset ownership is not particularly segmented
 amidst the natively-educated (Kiswahili) and the English-educated.

The most unsurprising finding is probably that electricity (or quality in
 energy) is consumed almost exclusively by the asset rich (band_general=4).
 This is simply because electricity is needed only by those who have already
 purchased electric/electronic assets (which form the bulk of medium and
 high assets).
 We also observe that while occupation-rank seems to transition the consumer
 from low-asset ownership to medium-asset ownership, it doesn't seem to
 be associated with high-asset ownership as much.

The results are summarised in the plot of the margins probabilities shown
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 (which is obtained with the command marginsplot in Stata).
 The reported count 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 in the regression is .49 (see the fitstat output in the Appendix for other
 results on the statistical fit).
 Even though we cannot comment on the price-elasticities in a cross-sectional
 analysis, the results indicate a marked change on ENDC across commodity
 groups in the different groups of asset owners.
 A further regression performed across multiple quantiles could provide
 further insights into how the purchase of assets changes in different quantiles
 of the society.

Historical developments in sub-Saharan Africa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The landscape of the political history of sub-Saharan African is dominated
 by anti-colonial movements in the past century.
 While it seems natural to hope for Adam Smith's principles to take hold
 in the nascent economies of the newly formed republics in the sub-Saharan
 Africa, neither the economic development nor the collective defense of
 nationalistic interests have followed a path similar to that of the developed
 world.
 The industrial class in the African countries is still poor in absolute
 terms and the problems of extreme poverty have remained largely unresolved
 in the large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa.
 The administrative successes and stabilities of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before.
 The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires,
 for example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries
 when compared to the administrative units (much as the political boundaries
 themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The processes of decolonization - which started in the late last century
 - have encompassed the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia
 and Africa aspiring to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 (often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike) their reach and success has been limited.
 in the developing world is that the goals aimed for by Adam Smith - of
 replacing feudalistic rent-seeking with fairness, equity and reward for
 hard-work - have been attempted more often with the nationalistic or socialist
 movements than free trade.
 The role of state has been an uncertain force in the developing world and
 has thus shaped identities at least as much as the evolution of market
 for industrial goods have.

Nigeria

\begin_layout Standard

The access to education is varied in Nigeria - because of the different
 levels of successes missionary education had in Nigeria.
 This in turn has created regional disparities in the current education
 levels between the northern and southern parts of Nigeria.
 The north has had a higher Islamic influence and the uniformity desired
 by the post-colonial government had had some initial challenges.
 At the start of the republic, it seemed that the market forces had been
 left relatively untouched - due to nature of the British rule which encouraged
 participation of a native authority.
 At the same time, the wage labour surviving on the peasantry was a trend
 that continued well into the post-colonial era.
 When the movements of African socialism in Nigeria picked up their momentum,
 the power of merchant class became limited.
 In the more recent decades, when MNCs could have brought more power to
 a working middle class, their presence hasn't changed the state of capital
 being controlled by a small minority - an environment where only the state
 monopolized industries and the informal sector seem to have expanded

.
 The recent Base of Pyramid (BoP) initiatives have not created a sufficient
 base for entrepreneurs, but they have indeed revived a focus on education
 and expanded the market for industrial goods.
 An average of 42% workforce in Nigeria have secondary education or higher.
 Upto 28% of those in mere survival activities have a secondary school certifica
te, and 12% have post-secondary qualifications

.
 Newly urbanized indigenous tribes and educated classes have taken up jobs
 that had earlier required a much lower level of education.
 The crowding hardly resolves the underlying problems with the economy -
 as the formal sector remains in doldrums.
 The state of economy, rapid population rise and the resulting migration
 from rural areas has given rise to problems urban overcrowding unmitigated
 by a large informal sector

Tanzania 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Given its engagement in the liberation movements in Mozambique in 1974 and
 the faith in planned economy inculcated by Nyrere, it would not be inaccurate
 to consider Tanzania the epicentre of the African socialism.
 But once the political independence was achieved in Tanzania, the membership
 of nationalist parties declined and the separation of civil service from
 political institutions became less of a priority.
 The faith in socialist planning under the leadership of Nyrere meant that
 the reduction of private sector did not experience much opposition.
 With a lack of support from its workers and a ban on producer-consumer
 societies, the socialist model seemed to have had some inconsistencies.
 In the decades after the independence, the industrial sector continued
 to suffer because of import subsidies.
 An import substituting industrialization (ISI) led to oversubsidizing when
 the need to prevent mass starvation called for an adjustment to capital
 flows.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and the use of a capital-intensive technology
 caused the oversubsidizing to spread further across other sectors.
 Subsequently, an over-reliance on capital for development resulted in decline
 of the industrial capacity utilization

 - many arguing that the workforce had moved to a subsistence through cultivatio
n approach.
 In its modern economy, only the public officials have had the advantage
 of becoming entrepreneurs.
 Even though imports could have improved the Tanzanian exchange rate - the
 problems around corruption have always posed limitations to trade reforms
 in Tanzania (particularly in the energy sector)

 With state regulated economy having had no ways to expand, the growth of
 parallel economy has been unavoidable - leaving a disconnect between the
 parallel markets and a protectionist trade policy.
 More recently, the firms from South Africa and China have increasingly
 participated in Tanzania while the training programs for the local labour
 and the plans to develop local infrastructure languish.
 The conflicts between the miners and SA migrant labour are common - while
 many Tanzanians are sent to South Africa for training

 Electricity is only available to about 10% of the population.
 The use of internet communications is higher in Tanzania than in Africa's
 average but access to finance is low (albeit rising) for the private sector.
 Quality of life differs significantly between urban and rural regions and
 the size of the informal sector (60%) is significant

Angola

\begin_layout Standard
Having achieved independence from Portugal in 1975, the competition between
 different movements that were vying to lead Angola descended the country
 into a civil war.
 The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), a Marxist-oriented
 group that included urban intellectuals, nominally led the country

.
 Similar to other post-colonial economies, the state-controlled companies
 thrived in Angola.
 In the view of Western economists, the state oil company Sonagol seemed
 to have played a quasi-fiscal role.
 The economy's dependence on oil revenues made economic diversification
 difficult

 Recently however, the industrial goods have proliferated in Anglola with
 the development of stronger business ties with China.

\begin_layout Standard

The political power is influenced by many ethnicities in Kenya and the clan
 dynamics is of high importance.
 Due to this reason, the policy changes can quickly develop into ethnic
 conflicts.
 For example, when resettlement was attempted under Kenyatta's leadership,
 the discontent was predominantly from non-

 population.
 Other attempts at nationalization - e.g.
 taking control of foods sales or establishment of purchase centres - have
 met with similar confrontations.
 The prevalence of small-scale independent works and lack of support offered
 to them has not been addressed either by the socialist governments or the
 growing private sector

 Much like other sub-Saharan African countries, there are extreme difference
 in the urban and rural life-styles in Kenya.
