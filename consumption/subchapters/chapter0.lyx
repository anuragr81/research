Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demand studies in the developing world often work with data that is much
 sparser and has overall less details on the individual households.
 Current surveys mitigate many such issues - but the problems that arise
 out of non-uniform institutions themselves make the standardisation of
 data across the developing countries rather challenging.
 Studies of consumption of quality in the developing countries have therefore
 often limited themselves to food where the measurement of quality is independen
t of consumed brand or type - details that are often not recorded in a typical
 consumer survey.
 Since a significant chunk of income is spent on food for most of the population
 in the developing countries, the variation in quality in food gives us
 a good picture of quality substitution.
 Still, problems like segmentation of price - due lack of a cheap transport
 infrastructure and sufficiently large firm sizes - makes the analysis of
 quality particularly prone to error.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current study, we attempt to quantify the choice of quality in the
 developing world.
 Instead of focusing on food quality alone, we also observe the effect of
 vast differences in life-style that living in urban vs rural areas would
 bring to the consumer in a developing country.
 The sheer lack of availability of certain goods in the rural areas - we
 believe - should also be noted in the consumption of quality.
 We comment on how overall quality may vary with economic inequalities across
 multiple economies as the consumer spreads the expenditure on quality across
 the commodity groups (food, energy etc.).
 This may provide us a better understanding of how quality of consumption
 changes in response to vast economic changes such as urban developments
 or market centralisation.
 This could be of interest both from a general demand analysis perspective
 and from a more specific conspicuous consumption perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To observe quality of consumption with respect to income inequalities across
 the developing countries, we motivate a model for substitution between
 a consumer's long-term needs that are fulfilled with ownership of assets
 or improvement of the socio-economic standing and the consumer's short-term
 needs that are fulfilled with an improved quality of consumption.
 The socio-economic standing of the consumer is determined by an order of
 what we identify as the parameters for status (income, education, occupation)
 as well as a history of quality of consumption.
 Needless to say, these parameters do not all have the same effect on the
 long-term socio-economic standing of the consumer.
 The improvement in quality of expenditure is measured with the expensive
 non-durable consumption (ENDC).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of assessing this substitution is to understand how the distribution
 of quality across the consumption groups (food, energy, housing etc.) should
 be affected by the long-term needs of (accumulation of durable goods, education
al needs etc.) which don't necessarily fall in the same separable commodity
 groups that we record in a typical consumer survey.
 It is also worth emphasising that we differentiate between quality consumption
 and conspicuous consumption.
 At least semantically speaking, the term conspicuous consumption encompasses
 only the exclusive consumption by the rich.
 Even though there are similarities between the current developments in
 Africa and the the rapid economic developments took place in the United
 States in the late 19th century as the latter's economy transitioned from
 a vastly agrarian society to an industrialised one, there are issue with
 extending the concepts identified by Veblen into modern economic theory.
 In the environment of the nascent economic transition in sub-Saharan Africa
 where severe economic inequalities are still observed, the options for
 conspicuous consumption as such are limited to a very small part of the
 population.
 The quality consumption and possession of long-term assets - on the other
 hand - are concerns for a larger section of the population that contribute
 to a consumer's long-term utility.
 Status - which can be seen as part of the long-term utility of the consumer
 - a rather complex social psychological phenomenon.
 One cannot thus make judgments on whether an items is a status good or
 not by observing consumer data alone.
 For example, if one were to rely only on whether an item can be afforded
 by the rich - then electricity, being used by a small and rich part of
 the population in a sub-Saharan African country like Tanzania, may appear
 to be a status good - at par with weddings which are a clear way of indicating
 status.
 Whether the same amount of money spent on weddings enhances status more
 than when it's spent on electricity is still a difficult question to answer
 - as it is a complex interaction of supply, wealth, assets and social identity
 that determine status in a society.
 As soon as one attempts to understand the underlying factors that contribute
 to status in the developing world, one cannot rely on the static assumption
 of a set of items being 
\shape italic
conspicuous
\shape default
.
 In Tanzania again, one may be tempted to argue - based on the literature
 on conspicuous consumption - that buying clothes indicates higher status.
 But without observing the effect that getting electricity in the house
 or moving to a bigger house may have on a consumer's long-term utility,
 we cannot accurately explain the household consumption on status - since
 the possibility that those spending on electricity or housing may actually
 be cutting down on clothing expenditure while deriving status from electricity
 or house ownership cannot be ruled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature on conspicuous consumption seems more impassioned and a little
 too wide-ranging in its conclusions from a the discussion on elasticities
 of a typical demand survey.
 In an attempt to limit our discussion to measurable criteria, we identify
 methods for identification of short-term and long-term needs.
 The typical standard diary and recall methods in a survey measure neither
 the quality of consumption nor the socio-economic standing of the consumer
 - which we wish to embark upon in the study.
 As it turns out, the measurement of quality is relatively easy - if we
 rely on the availability of price information to classify high-quality
 (expensive) items apart from their cheaper substitutes.
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data therefore, eggs and milk are deemed of lower
 quality than goat and beef for proteins.
 Similarly for transport, bicycle is deemed of lower quality than car and
 so on.
 Except for some items that would be missing in the developing country when
 comparing the consumption between two countries, this is a relatively easy
 task.
 For the more difficult task of measuring the socio-economic standing of
 a consumer

The terms social capital - or status capital are also used in the literature
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, we rely on the measure of socio-economic-status (SES) - which is a standard
 measure of the socio-economic status often used in the sociological and
 health studies.
 The long-term utility of the consumer in the model thus consists of a vector
 of income, education and region/locality/neighborhood.
 In addition, we also include the ownership of durable goods (defined as
 items to be purchased with an intent of long-term ownership) and a history
 of expensive non-durable consumption (hereon abbreviated as ENDC) in the
 measures for status.
 This is of key importance since income, education, occupation or residence
 are usually fixed in the short-run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal in the current chapter is to not explore status consumption per
 se - but rather outline how status-related consumption could be viewed
 in a conventional model for consumer demand.
 To comment on status consumption, we base ourselves on the assertion that
 if consumption for status does exist, it must appear in the long-term utility
 for the rational consumer in a model.
 In other words, for a rational consumer to spend on status consumption,
 she must see some status utility from consumption in the long-term or the
 short-term.
 We don't attempt to explain whether status is a long-term concern or a
 short-term concern for the consumer - as it is a matter of social observation.
 Similarly, it is an issue of social psychological judgment - if not ideology
 - to conclude that individuals buying durable goods as their income increases
 is a matter of status consumption (and thus a waste) and not simply social
 mobility.
 Regardless of what one views as status consumption, we can test from the
 data whether expensive nondurable consumption increases with changes towards
 industrialisation (as seems to be the case when reading Veblen) or that
 expensive nondurable consumption is always used to compensate for not having
 as much as status and durable goods as others.
 If non-durable consumption is indeed correlated with social mobility (i.e.
 purchase of assets or an upward movement in education and occupation for
 a member of the household) or if those who don't see any changes in long-term
 possession of assets or changes in occupation-rank or education levels,
 continue to maintain high non-durable consumption in face of price changes,
 then we may have something to say about how non-durable consumption matters
 to the household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our basic framework can be used to compare the developing and the developed
 economies as well.
 Since the durable goods have a higher upfront cost compared to the quality
 consumption, the accumulation of durable goods is a clear indicator tifhe
 consumer's high expectation of the stability of her income if not a real
 stability of high income.
 We thus compare the accumulation of long-term durable goods (LTDG) in a
 developed economy with that of in developing economy by ordering the LTDG
 in the markets based on their cost of acquisition.
 The differences in the costs of the two successive LTDG in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cost-order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for LTDG present the substitutability between acquisition of durable goods
 and quality consumption.
 A higher difference between two successive LTDG costs is likely make the
 consumption of quality more tempting for a consumer.
 In the developing world, not only are the markets underdeveloped to make
 rental options available for an expensive durable good (LTDG), there is
 somewhat of an absence of credit facilities as well.
 Both of these make the difference between successive LTDG costs higher
 than in the developed countries (where markets are more developed and either
 some credit to purchase LTDG or a direct rental of LTDG is made available
 to consumer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Literature Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the study of consumer preferences over time, the tendencies of habit
 formation have been noted by both the behavioural and classical approaches.
 The measurement of the effect of change in habits and quality on the consumer
 price has in fact had a long tradition (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment).
 In the demand analysis literature, Muellbauer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."

\end_inset

 points out that a model for myopia amongst consumers could explain their
 preferences better.
 In later works where a general setting of the intertemporal substitution
 problem in a life-cycle context is used, a rational utility-optimising
 consumer can balance between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned and actual savings over her life-time.
 This is the setting explored by a few recent behavioural approaches (see
 Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

) that have attempted to model the rules of mental accounting that could
 be used by the consumers.
 Such models can explain consumers' inertia of choices and allow the representat
ive consumer to be influenced by behavioural factors such as willpower rather
 than be subservient to an optimised plan for life-time savings and consumption.
 In an attempt to model real-life consumption patterns, the representative
 consumer in such a model is subject to accumulating items that she doesn't
 need or acquiring habits of consumption she could barely afford in the
 long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to view the role of social identities in relation to how
 assets are accumulated over generations and passed on as endowments as
 well.
 Empirical studies in both the developed world and the developing countries
 have found social group identities relevant to consumption (see Chao et
 al.

 and Khamis et al.

).
 A behavioural model can explain such behaviour with the introduction of
 reference points in the utility function (see Markowitz Utility).
 The relevance of reference points isn't limited to laboratory experiment
 contexts.
 For example, Robert Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 finds that signaling needs become more important amongst the lower economic
 strata when they are huddled in the overpopulated suburban areas of big
 cities in the US.
 A more general approach to social order is proposed by Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 who motivate the case for a ranking order of status while attempting to
 measure the tendency of the consumer to move herself up in the ranking
 order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the developing countries, urban industrialisation and overpopulation
 in the is likely to create vast difference in the life-styles between urban
 and rural areas.
 Although a detailed time-series of consumption microdata matching the respectiv
e quality in the developed world is hardly available in the developing countries
, the framework for risk preferences has often been used by microeconomists
 to understand the consumer demand.
 An important economic model for urban and rural interactions is the Lewis
 model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GollinLRF"

\end_inset

 - which views urban migration as a necessary phase of development - leading
 to a competition between industrial and agricultural sectors for labour
 and food (it predicts the prices of food to rise as labour moves from agricultu
re to industry).
 The worker/farmer is meant to maximise her income and reduce the risk associate
d with it as she is faced with the choice of migration to the urban areas.
 We note that a flight to urban areas is often not only an escape from desponden
t circumstances but also an access to expanded consumption basket and a
 chance for improbable social mobilities.
 A model that accounts for the competition amongst the individuals for status
 or a place in a perceived social order - therefore - could refine such
 a model by adding more incentives to migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature has associated the finer trends in consumption with the interacti
on between the introduction of industrial goods and the status needs of
 the consumers.
 Deaton and Dreze

 Sen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sen2005Calories"

\end_inset

 has attributed this squeeze to the rise in the poverty-level for consumption
 of non-food items.
 From a behavioural perspective, this would amount to the change in the
 reference points for non-food consumption.
 An issue with the use of reference points, however, is its measurement
 in the large-scale microdata.
 Unlike in the controlled settings of an experiment, where the reference
 points can be specified more clearly, they are more difficult to justify
 in the consumption microdata.
 But so long as a separation between the bare neessities and luxuries can
 be justified, a framework for measurement of consumption can be used to
 understand change in needs of a society.

 consumption in the regions of erstwhile East and West Germany, for example,
 Friehe et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 attempt to answer whether prolonged measures of income equality (and therefore
 stagnant ownership of durable goods) can influence non-durable consumption
 asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes.
 If the macroeconomic factors and issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) can be controlled for
 in the data, then a model for long-term (or more stable) needs against
 short-term (or more uncertain) needs can explain the demand pressures induced
 by the differences in the developed and developing states of economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current chapter we attempt to measure how consumers may balance their
 long-term and short-term needs as the market introduces new durable goods
 and the improved quality over time.
 The perceptions of consumers do not serve as an input to the current model
 - and hence no attempt is made to measure status or to model self-evaluation
 of the consumers in the study.
 Instead, we focus on how demand for quality and long-term durable goods
 evolves when subjected to changes in supply of items, their price and rise
 in consumer incomes.
 The earliest such attempt we know of is due to James Duesensberry 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Duesenberry1949"

\end_inset

 who had explained the role of savings rates and security on consumption.
 Similar problems were addressed by the permanent income hypothesis proposed
 by Milton Friedman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"

\end_inset

 - who modeled the consumers' smoothening of income over the expected future
 time periods.
 While challenges were posed to both the relative income and permanent income
 hypotheses, they have provided empirical answers to some important questions
 related to the role of income and class on consumption.
 In the current model, we view status - if relevant - as part of the long-term
 utility of the consumer which she may save towards when not attempting
 to improve the quality of consumption in the short-term.
 In other words, instead of measuring status perceptions in the society,
 we measure the determinants of status in a society i.e.
 factors such as occupation, educational level, income and the net asset
 worth of the individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a behavioural economics perspective, it is possible to view the consumer's
 preference to long-term protection as a perception of risk.
 Thus one could model status in the long-term utility of the consumer as
 a probability of promotion to a state of higher income and assets (or any
 characteristic that is perceived to have a higher stability of incomes).
 The status-differences - viewed as a probability of social mobility - could
 therefore vary across countries and time - depending on how individuals
 place themselves in a perceived (risky) social order.
 Further, if severe social stratification doesn't exist in the societies,
 then it is fair to assume that through social interactions, those spending
 more on higher quality and acquiring long-term durable goods over time
 would increase their likelihood of being in a higher status category (for
 future generations if not for themselves).
 Thus status could be connected with the consumption in a model - letting
 us explain how the former could change over time as consumers act on the
 (subjective) probability of status promotion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the differences in purchasing power between the sections of a society
 and the desire for mobility amongst them are drivers of consumption in
 an economy is an idea that goes back at least as far as Adam Smith who
 had proposed that economic progress could be achieved by letting an exchange
 between the rich and poor thrive
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Such a model seems promising at first - given that in any post-feudal society,
 a promise for social mobility has picked up some importance.
 In nearly all the developing countries, we see a new working class having
 replaced the feudal or colonial systems of the century before.
 It is natural, therefore, to compare the developments of status competitions
 across the post-war Africa and Asia with the rise of middle class in the
 post-medieval Europe (see Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 for a detailed account of status competitions).
 The competitions amongst the nascent industrial classes for status has
 been a subject of many sociological studies in the late 20th century.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 noted Veblen's pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in the Indian context - termed

 - as the erstwhile lower classes emulated the habits of higher social classes
 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, the habits of the upper economic classes were similarly
 observed to have expanded to the middle and lower classes in the decades
 after the second world war (see Appendix for a survey of the economic history
 of a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the changes in the political landscape of Africa and Asia have been recent,
 the effects of past political conflicts still reflect themselves into the
 differences in occupational-classes and educational levels.
 In the developing countries, social mobility is often influenced by social
 identities (see Khamis at al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia"

\end_inset

, Kaus
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) - whose evolution over time has been shaped by the factors outside the
 realms of consumption and income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The segmentation of both demand and status determinants based on social
 identities and region is not the only problem one faces with the use of
 a model where consumers spend on items in the hope for social mobility
 ( see Blanden-Machin
\shape italic

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BlandenSocMobility2008"

\end_inset


\shape default
) on the measurement of social mobility based on the life-cycle transition
 in the identified income and occupation groups).
 The dynamics of status are in fact far more complex and even if we view
 these dynamics as the transition of education, income and identity, their
 evolution over time remains dependent on unobservable parameters and prevents
 us from drawing meaningful conclusions from the model.
 For the model to make an empirical sense, there are two primary issues
 with the uncertainty of status determinants that must be addressed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First is the uncertainty in income growth arising out of political risk.
 Since both high and low social mobilities are associated with political
 changes, the uncertainty in incomes is less deterministic at high and low
 levels of social mobility.
 It is possible to assume a particular structure of income growth (an approach
 that is often necessitated due to lack of or poor quality of income data
 - more so in the developing countries), but since the consumer is assumed
 to be influenced by the possibility of growth in her income, the uncertainty
 in income growth under political risks must be parametrised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second is the role played by the state and welfare institutions in the transitio
n of status determinants.
 The consumer's expected growth in the educational levels and other status
 determinants are likely to influence consumption - but are essentially
 public goods i.e.
 the expectation for their growth depends on the strength of the state instituti
ons.
 In the developed world, the state institutions often intervene when market
 forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertakings
 or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 In the developing world, however, the state institutions are generally
 weaker and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distributio
n of public goods.
 The development of services such as health, education or even electric
 power where a consumer could spend her income is often stalled due to lack
 of a predictable payment structure amongst the customers.
 It may seem ironical then that despite the majority of non-agrarian workforce
 being employed in the private enterprises, one cannot assume perfects markets
 in the developing countries - since the private enterprise receives very
 little governmental assistance and is unable to undertake projects that
 require a higher investment (in relative terms)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This also confirms the conventional wisdom that without the key institutions,
 one cannot assume that more spending on a conspicuous item by the rich
 could benefit the society as a whole.
 The hope that money obtained from the rich on the item could potentially
 fund employment and other opportunities rests upon the institutions being
 strong enough to ensure that the desired trickle down effect works.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 When the distribution of assets such as education are assisted by the state,
 the expected risk in levels in education themselves is clearly lowered.
 Thus, how much education eventually matters towards status may depend on
 how consumers set themselves apart in the social order based on other determina
nts of status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't provided by
 the state (as is the case in the developing world), a consumer would associate
 higher risk with the expected growth in education.
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth).
 In a model that can compare two economies with a different degree of state
 support, the strength of institutions determines the expectation of accumulatio
n of public goods (such as family education level) and how much education
 may matter for long-term status.
 The latter is however influenced by how markets evolve to provide expanded
 consumption choices to the consumer.
 In a model where a consumer optimises the consumption in view of an expectation
 of status promotion, therefore, it is necessary to consider the strength
 of state and welfare institutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issues as above are not uncommon in demand analysis.
 A model for consumer demand often relies on
\shape italic
 ceteris paribus 
\shape default
assumptions on the supply (e.g.
 incomes).
 As long as we can assume that the uncertainty in income and the strength
 of institutions are 
\shape italic
priced
\shape default
 in the market (e.g.
 by assuming that consumers pay fair taxes to sustain state institutions),
 we could study the relationship between consumption and long-term status
 with the observed-prices of the consumption items in the market.
 However conclusions from such a model can only be as strong as the assumption
 of status and status determinants being priced in the market and quality
 of data available on the observed prices.
 The approach of interpreting status in terms of more tractable measures
 of status determinants such as education or occupation may solve the problem
 of non-observability of status, but it doesn't solve the problems of measuring
 how well the countries are governed, how strong their institutions are
 or how much trust exists in the government policies.
 If the available data on such questions is less reliable than the data
 available on consumption itself, one cannot establish a strong relationship
 between status and consumption.
 The exercise to understand the determinants of status is not a futile one
 but how the micro-structure of consumption relates with the longer-term
 development of status is a more complex phenomenon requiring us to consider
 socio-political factors which could be as difficult to measure as the perceptio
n of status itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, there is plenty of literature that engages in social commentary
 without a precise ontological sense of status differences in the society
 (see Manski

 have argued for example that in the post-war developed world, the differences
 between the rich and poor have been reduced to a level that an exchange
 for status and wealth cannot be made lucrative to the poor any more.
 While the level of economic inequalities have indeed narrowed since the
 18th century, the authors claim that the price of luxuries has exceeded
 the opportunity cost to the rest of the society is more difficult to test
 empirically.
 Foremost, this is due to the lack of appropriate microdata but the difficulties
 are not eased with a lack of clarity on what qualifies as a luxury.
 Hirsch

 also introduces scarcity and overuse as a motivator for status competitions
 - ideas that may need some interpretation for empirical measurement.
 The disparate political risks, technological advancement and the social
 contexts in the worlds set apart by a few past centuries indeed contribute
 to the difficulties in verifying such claims as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To say that the long-term dynamics of status determinants are complex is
 not to say that consumption isn't shaped by one's perception of status.
 While in a typical demand study, the rational consumer - knowing all about
 her future plans - may have no reason to engage in any status related consumpti
on at all (neither in short-term nor in long-term), but there exists ample
 evidence to suggest that consumers do engage in status-related consumption.
 As Thaler et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

 had argued in their influential paper on a behavioural life-cycle hypothesis,
 there should be no overeating and overspending if the consumers were rational.
 if there is indeed nothing to be gained by status-related consumption (the
 assumption of conspicuous consumption being essentially futile - as was
 argued by Veblen), then there is no way for the rational consumer to derive
 any utility from status-related consumption.
 However, the mere existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there
 is some utility to be derived by spending on status.
 Whether they do so due to habits, myopia or longer-term expectation of
 status is a difficult question - which we don't attempt to answer with
 the study of consumer data (and is not needed by a revealed preference
 analysis) - but the degree to which a consumer engages in short-term vs
 long-term needs in the presence of factors that may translate into status
 is possible and this we shall attempt in the current chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that a long-term utility is derived by accumulating goods that
 others would require time and money to achieve while quality in every commodity
 group also indicates.
 a separation between the long-term needs from short-term needs is viewed
 with a model based on purchases of durable goods and quality - recognising
 the income and education groups that are more likely to maintain stable
 purchasing power over time.
 Thus, Veblen's idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of habits of the rich by the poor is encompassed by the purchase of durable
 goods and quality in our model while the idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

invidious comparison
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is expressed by possession of less accessible long-term possessions (if
 not education and social identity).
 in a later chapter, we elaborate on a model under life-cycle assumptions
 where a consumer's planned consumption differs from the actual consumption
 - addressing some of the concerns we have raised in the measurement of
 status-related consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A relevant model which has influenced much of the empirical literature on
 conspicuous consumption was proposed by Ireland 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

.
 The model uses a visibility factor to argue that the perception of one's
 income by others derives an additional utility (see Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

 for this substantiation and an empirical approach towards the Ireland model).
 As long as conspicuous consumption exists - one can argue that the visibility
 factor in Ireland model ought to be non-zero and the consumers would 
\shape italic
infer
\shape default
 visible utility by observing consumption.
 The visibility factor based approach allows consumers to sepnd on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 product.
 While this apporach has its merits, we find the assumption of status being
 derived from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

futile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items too strong for empirical purposes in a more general study of inequalities
 and quality in the developed and the developing economies (see Ustuner
 et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 for difficulties in extending the literature on conspicuous consumption
 in the developed countries on to the developing world).
 The futility assumption makes less sense in the developing world 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 where there are far fewer exclusive conspicuous items and the expenditure
 on conspicuous items is limited to a much smaller portion of the population.
 More importantly, since an item both provides advantages through visibility
 and through quality, the empirical classification of status-items in the
 developed world itself based on visibility is fraught with problems (escaped
 only through a consumer survey of one's own).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of deciding on a crisp boundary between visible and non-visible
 utilities, we focus on the quality defined as expensive non-durable consumption
 (which prices status or visible benefits and signals elitism) and ownership
 of durable goods (which signals that it'll take longer for others to acquire
 a particular costly item).
 Both ENDC and LTDG contribute to the long-term utility that the consumers
 optimise over time.
 Our focus on quality criteria for long-term utility rather than on visibility
 is not intended to diminish the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption but only to include the latter in a wider model for status
 and income.
 Visibility does contribute to status and therefore utility to the consumer
 - but one also needs to relate visible consumption with the underlying
 economic variables that may drive status (or utility) in the long-run.
 By means of an analogy, let's consider the market for cars where status
 is signalled through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption might tell us that the consumers
 pay more attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would like to see primarily - i) the constraints on
 occupation and income that exist in the respective areas and ii) the price
 differences in the cars being sold in the market.
 In our original problem of status consumption, while it is true that individual
s spend more on their outward appearances (despite controlling for everything
 else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not all what status
 consumption may comprise of (see the Figure and Eastman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Eastman1999"

\end_inset

 for the terminology around status consumption).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we detail in the later sections, visibility can be viewed in relation
 to the consumer's preference order of commodity groups for quality.
 In the different separable commodity groups we identify for consumption,
 we assume that the consumer adjusts quality based on a preference order
 over the commodity groups - e.g.
 a consumer may consider quality for transport more important than quality
 in food (or vice versa).
 When prices change, the consumers are assumed to maintain a pecking order
 of quality which they compromise on or overspend on.
 Note however that such an order matters for any two selected items only
 if they are in different commodity groups.
 For the items within the commodity group, a preference based on visibility
 doesn't exist in the model.
 For example, in the Tanzanian LSMS data where we identify five categories
 - Food, Energy, Transport, Household and Social Functions, visibility may
 not have much of a role to play within each of the commodity groups even
 though the consumers may consider the quality in one group more important
 than in the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current model for long-term and short-term needs does not view status
 consumption as futile but relates it with an expectation of social mobility
 - which is influenced more with long-term possessions than non-durable
 consumption.
 
\bar under
In terms of the model, an identity (religious, racial etc.) carries status
 only through a history of past LTDG ownership, incomes/occupations and
 persistent-high quality consumption - a criterion that may allow us to
 quantify the role of identity in status.
 From a more general demand analysis perspective, such a comparison tells
 us about the effect of supply issues and inequalities on quality.
 In a further substantiation of the model under an intertemporal substitution
 setting in a subsequent chapter, we include the probabilities of ownership
 of LTDG in the expectation of status promotion to arrive at a life-cycle
 formulation of the model for long-term needs vs quality.

We start with demonstrating that a simple formulation such as that of Stone-Gear

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The econometric methods corresponding to the indirect utility can be easily
 devised if one assumes that the consumer observes the price index of an
 item whose many variants exist in the market.
 However since a better quality item is set to be more expensive than the
 less quality item, a switch to higher quality by the consumer is inseparable
 in the model from an increase in the price-index of the item whose multiple
 variants exist in the market.
 The increase in the price-index of an item (regardless of whether it's
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shift -so that the relative price structure of the variants remains the
 same or not) only implies the consumer would reduce the quantity consumed
 of the item.
 We may still use the model if we assume that the individual's quality preferenc
es are fixed - but a change in quality due to price cannot be studied with
 the model as such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the usual limitations of an additive utility function such as Stone
 Geary indeed also apply.
 But our intention is only to point out that an explicit measure of quality
 is necessary in the either the direct utility or the cost-function for
 us to interpret meaningful results for quality using the corresponding
 econometric method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution of quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the model is to measure the distribution of the quality of consumpti
on and the ownership of assets throughout the population.
 The items of high-quality can exist in every category and they are not
 assumed be equivalent or substitutable (kobe beef cannot be substituted
 with a luxury travel as is).
 Due to assumptions of seperability and substitution within the group, we
 do not consider the consumption on a group of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high-quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items (which is indeed the route taken by the studies in conspicuous consumptio
n ).
 Instead of purchasing an overall quality, we consider how consumers sets
 some weight on higher-quality within each group ( i.e.
 the portion of total expenditure spent on the expensive non-durable consumption
) based on her taste and prices of higher quality in every category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we consider an environment of stable prices i.e.
 if we ignore the effect of price changes for a moment, then the distribution
 of ENDC weights may change when the individuals acquire long-term durable
 goods and spend on their upkeep and maintenance costs or as they give up
 on hopes of acquiring costlier LTDG (possibly due to other needs).
 It is assumed that a consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality
 (there is little evidence of that in the data) - therefore when prices
 are stable, a rise in expensive nondurable consumption must come either
 from an increase in income or from depletion of savings (sale of long-term
 durable goods).
 Likewise, a drop in ENDC must be due to purchase of LTDG, addressing of
 more urgent needs or a drop in income (when price are stable).
 We assume that the rational consumers rin our model hope to increase their
 social status through consumption as they increase their utility in their
 lifetime.
 Therefore either LTDG ownership or quality consumption is attempted at
 all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the environment of stable prices, the consumption is influenced by long-term
 expectations - which is measured in the model as a vector of occupation,
 education, region (locality, neighborhood) and LTDG.
 Since income, occupation and education are fixed in the short-run, what
 changes most often is the acquisition of LTDG that are available in the
 market if the needs of the consumer haven't changed.
 Whenever long-term durable goods are purchased, the consumer must undergo
 a change in the weight of the quality in the consumption categories if
 i) her needs (including status needs) haven't changed (status can only
 be indicated through LTDG ownership or ENDC) ii) if she is not saving for
 another asset (the consumer is more likely to spend on quality if she doesn't
 have more long-term durable goods planned to purchase in the future) .
 We assume that except for the change brought about by LTDG or needs, a
 consumer does not change her taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we now turn to the effect of price changes, then we must consider the
 price of quality in the various groups and that the quality in one category
 may be substituted with quality in another.
 Such a substitution may not be perfect (as is required in a simple-repackaging
 approach) but a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport
 to food or vice versa - driven by change in prices, LTDG ownership or needs.
 To illustrate this substitution with an example, consider a middle-income
 family that cuts down on expenses (due to loss of income) by moving to
 a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants are
 fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place - so the consumption would either
 shift to saving for a better car (LTDG) or improve quality in some other
 category (better jewelry, better schooling for kids etc.) - assuming the
 needs of the family haven't changed (including the status needs).
 In this case, the price of high quality (fine-dining) was too high in the
 food category.
 The example also illustrates that the difference between needs and status-needs
 is not a concern for this model - as the model only observes the differences
 between high-price and low-price consumption in the same group - assuming
 that the essential needs are independent of the wealth of the consumer.
 In the example, therefore, one could proxy the the needs of the family
 with simply the number of family members and their age.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the model, the difference between the status of a rich and a
 poor family is not through disparate educational needs of the rich and
 poor children but instead through a more general need for the family to
 maintain status across all categories - a task that is better afforded
 with higher income.
 The aggregate sense of status is derived by expensive non-durable consumption
 and possession of LTDG in all commodity groups - driven by wealth and income
 of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class needs of the consumer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a time-series formulation of the model is postponed until a later
 chapter, is is worth clarifying that the expensive nondurable consumption
 (ENDC) weights contribute to status over a long-period of time - except
 for which the long-term utility is influenced by LTDG purchases and the
 occupation-education-region vector.
 We maintain the view status is not achieved with short-run purchases -
 but the planning for high-status over the life-time and the attempts to
 get into a rich-club can be indicated by a disproportionately high expenditure
 on high quality consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, faced with a choice of needs, one would reduce the quality
 immediately.
 Needs of energy are more important than consuming electricity.
 There is indeed both myopia and inertia in the choices - therefore a consumer
 is likely to switch to electricity or better meat when she receives a higher
 income likely to stick to it when the price increase.
 The consumption in the next cycle therefore depends on the current ownership
 of assets and the current quality.
 In addition to the state of the consumer, such demands are shaped also
 by the introduction of LTDG and high-quality products.
 We explore in the analysis of the time-series of ownership in a later chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The supply issues do matter in the comparison with other countries.
 While we identify the six categories in the data from consumption survey,
 we also recognise that quality variation doesn't always exist in the market
 for every category.
 For example, in Tanzania - the car rental market seems small and the variation
 in the quality of cars being sold may be smaller than in a typical city
 in the developed world.
 When quality variation is not observed, only the relevant assets in a category
 can bring status.
 If status needs are fixed over short-term, then the unavailability of the
 quality variation in the category would either increase the savings for
 the next available asset in the category or increase the quality consumption
 in some other category (assuming status needs remain the same).
 These 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jumps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in quality in fact are what make the distinction between the developed
 and the developing countries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model Formulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In formulating the model, we explain why model for quality-substitution
 depends on a measure for quality applicable across all commodity groups.
 We then explain the other level of substitution that associates the ownership
 of long-term durable goods (LTDG) with quality.
 Explaining why neither a two-state budgeting model nor a simple-repackaging
 model would be suitable for this substitution, we motivate a discrete model
 for utility for the substitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When prices or needs change, the consumers who observe quality variants
 in commodity groups would cut back on overall quality by switching to either
 cheaper quality within each group or by cutting back quality in one group
 to increase in another.
 The quality substitution within the commodity group is relatively easy
 to measure but for one to observe the quality substitution across multiple
 commodity group, we would need a generic method for measuring quality across
 all commodity groups.
 This may further help determine how consumers switch between commodity
 groups for quality over time.
 It may be possible - eventually - to consider a preference order of commodity
 groups which is used by the consumer to cut back on quality as the incomes
 fall or prices rise
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It could be of further interest to see how such a preference order of commodity
 groups compares with the order of visible commodity groups obtained in
 experiments
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is tempting to view this quality-substitution in a a two-state budgeting
 model - which is based on a hierarchy of separable needs and is commonly
 used in the literature on household demand.
 To proceed with this model, one may consider the proportion of expenditure
 on high quality in every commodity group for every consumer (let's say
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},...,\lambda_{c}...,)$
\end_inset

 ) - a vector that can be written as a function on the consumers LTDG ownership
 and long-term needs (number of children, age etc.).
 Here, one can then measure how the quality substitution (the complementarity
 or supplementarity) between the commodity groups changes in response to
 to the prices of the commodities.
 However, a key condition for the tree-like structure for the two-state
 budgeting model is that the relative demand between two items in any two
 different categories changes only as response to the total expenditure
 (i.e response to price changes and total expenditure changes must use the
 same channels of communication in the commodity tree
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer,StrotzUtilityTree1957"

\end_inset

).
 It turns out that this is impossible to guarantee if we claim that quality
 can be substituted from across the commodity groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the issue with the two-state budgeting approach, let's consider
 a two-group world of food and energy - within which we have items beef-bread-mi
lk and electricity-kerosene-charcoal respectively.
 If consumers don't cut back on quality in one group to gain quality in
 another, the items - food and energy - can be assumed (and tested empirically)
 to be separable groups - since it is plausible for a consumer to allocate
 some money 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy respectively in the first-stage (based on her knowledge
 of the price-indices for food and energy).
 Once the expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 are fixed, the (representative) consumer can subsequently decide in the
 second-state how much of kerosene or electricity to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and how much beef or bread to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Individual prices of every item within the category would decide which
 food varieties and which energy sources are to be purchased.
 Under the conditions of weak separability, it is implied that cheaper bread
 (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose
 a more expensive fuel (price-sensitivity for electricity, charcoal etc.
 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

 for details on the theory).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This condition - however - falls apart if we introduce the substitution
 for quality across the commodity group.
 More particularly, if we assume that a consumer gets quality utility from
 using electricity and from eating beef interchangeably, then having decided
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 does not guarantee that she would not switch to more consumption on electricity
 if kobe beef becomes cheaper.
 This is because overall quality - due to our assumption - is aggregated
 from across the commodity groups.
 Thus unlike in the case of energy and food without quality substitution
 across-commodity-groups, cheaper food can be compensated with the switch
 to electricity.
 If we have set ourselves to test the presence of such a substitution across
 commodity groups, we cannot assume that it simply doesn't exist.
 If price sensitivities and total expenditure sensitivities don't follow
 the same channel of communication in the two-state budgeting tree - then
 the necessary condition for two-stage separability is not met (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

) - and so even though a tree-structure could present a relevant view of
 the hierarchy of commodity groups, we cannot accept the model due to the
 weak separable condition on overall quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rejection of the weak separability also clarifies the dependence of
 LTDG ownership on the high quality consumption in every commodity group
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},...,\lambda_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 As such, there are two way of expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 as a function of LTDG ownership - first is to include LTDG from across
 all commodity groups in the function and the second is to consider the
 LTDG in only the commodity group 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 where the high quality consumption is being observed.
 The first option assumes that durable goods influence quality consumption
 in every group while the latter introduces separability amongst owned durable
 goods as well.
 If a consumer ought to balance the the overall quality with the LTDG ownership,
 the latter option is a particularly limiting one.
 With a preference to the former option and noticing the range of products
 in the consumer surveys, we formalise the substitution of overall quality
 and the LTDG ownership by introducing the following condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series bold
C.1
\series default
 There are only two types of commodity groups - one where LTDG exist and
 one where they don't exist.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A strong distinction between the two types of commodity groups simplifies
 our model of consumer demand.
 With this condition, there are only two ways a consumer can spend on short-term
 consumption - either by switching between the variants of an item (choosing
 higher or lower quality of a composite good) or spending more on an elementary
 good.
 For example, since quality variation doesn't exist in transport and housing
 data in the Tanzanian survey, the consumer is assumed to spend on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elementary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 short-term consumption instead of saving for a LTDG (if the LTDG exist
 in a group).
 Another way to see this is that the elementary short-term consumption in
 the commodity groups where LTDG exist competes with the group where quality
 variation exists - for the consumer's money.
 The goal of the comparison of ENDC with LTDG is thus to compare the consumer's
 respective short-term needs and long-term needs
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Status can be seen as one of the long-term needs of the consumer.
 While we discuss status utility in a later current chapter, it is worth
 mentioning that since we view status as a ranking order amongst individuals,
 the purchase of long-term durable goods have an immediate impact on status
 (a long-term need) than a sudden increase in quality of non-durable consumption.
 This would be used later in the model of status based on quality and long-term
 durable consumption.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that only either ENDC or LTDG can dominate in a category (i.e.
 the condition C.1) risks ignoring some quality differences when LTDG too
 have quality variation.
 For example, if several types of cars exist in the transport commodity
 group as do the limousine companies for a taxi-commute, then C.1 would ignore
 the quality variation in the either.
 To ensure that the quality differences amongst LTDG are not ignored when
 there are quality difference in the non-durable consumption within the
 same category where C.1 is assumed, we impose another relevant condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
C.2 Acquiring long-term durable goods (LTDG) is always more expensive than
 engaging in the higher quality or expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirically, this condition is not as problematic as it may at first appear.
 For example, there are no LTDG in the food category (or energy) that could
 matter for the long-term utility for the consumer while the quality consumption
 in housing is made irrelevant by the high (relative) price of housing.
 Even in the taxi vs cars example above, we can ignore the quality variation
 in limousine-companies as long as C.2 is satisfied.
 This is not to say that a model with quality variation amongst LTDG is
 not possible (a consumer can choose between types of housing for example)
 - only that for us to consider the quality differences in housing, we would
 need to relieve the assumption that only one of LTDG or ENDC can matter
 in commodity group (unless one views housing too as non-durable consumption).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On to the Tanzanian data, where we identify the commodity groups - food,
 energy, housing and transport, it's only food and energy where only quality
 matters (the saving for future is ruled out with non-durable consumption).
 Further, food is the only group where we have quantity consumed recorded
 - and thus the quality of protein, carbohydrates, beverages etc.
 - each of which is treated as a composite good - is easy to determine.
 We treat Housing and transport, on the other hand, as elementary goods
 (i.e.
 no quality variation is assumed).
 Thus we can measure the overall quality (or other short-term consumption)
 in comparison with the savings for future purchase of LTDG in an environment
 where new goods are supplied and the expectations for future income growth
 change over time.
 The measures for quality for the composite and elementary goods are as
 follows:

 As the goods are elementary, a higher proportion amounts to higher quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have discussed two levels of substitution - the first is between
 quantity and quality in every commodity group and the second between the
 short-term and long-term needs.
 These become easy to integrate due to condition C.1 and C.2.
 More particularly when commodity groups are by dominated either by LTDG
 or by ENDC, the substitution between long-term and short-term needs also
 contributes to the substitution between commodity groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's illustrate this with an example : consider a two commodity-group world
 where prices are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{1}^{2},p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for group 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{1},p_{2}^{2},p_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for group 2.
 Assuming the price are in an ascending order, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{2}^{1}$
\end_inset

 are the prices of the cheapest commodity in each group and can be considered
 the base-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively .
 Assume for a moment that the consumer's income remains constant.
 Notice also that one of the preconditions of the quality-measure we've
 adopted (i.e.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:quality_equation"

\end_inset

 which is due to the composite commodity theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

) is that the prices move together.
 Now if price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 increases and the quantities consumed of the item with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 remain the same, then for the total expenditure in group 1 (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

) to remain the same, the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 must decline (i.e.
 less of the items with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be consumed).
 If the consumer doesn't decrease the quantities consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1},q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=p_{1}^{1}q_{1}^{1}+p_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{3}q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 would increase due to rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer must adjust 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=p_{2}^{1}q_{2}^{1}+p_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{3}q_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - since her total income remains the same.
 It is possible, therefore, that the consumer spends less on food overall
 - for example - to support her energy needs.
 The switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be the first-level of substitution while the switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 would constitute the second-level of substitution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's see how our assumption changes the problem.
 Consider the case when the group 2 is comprised only of elementary goods
 with the just one price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and a set of long-term durable goods whose price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

>>
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 (LTDG) .
 In that case, the first-level of substitution would be applicable only
 for group 1 and the second-level of substitution would be driven only by
 the savings for the long-term durable good in the group 2.
 Thus under C.1 and C.2, certain commodity groups being dominated by LTDG
 and others by ENDC associate the second-level of substitution with the
 LTDG ownership in the model.
 It's easy to see that increases in incomes i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2}$
\end_inset

 do not change the substitution much differently from how change in prices
 would.c

As the idea of simple repackaging requires perfect substitution, its applicabili

 As an example the switch from kerosene to electricity is far more than
 an improvement of quality in

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with base-price of kerosene and makes the expression of electricity consumption
 in terms of the quantity and price of kerosene consumed somewhat of a stretched
 justification.
 To proceed, one must consider how using electricity would change the utility
 for food (with refrigerator), household consumption (hair-dryers) etc..
 The classical approach taken by Fisher and Shell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 recommends adjusting the prices of the final goods i.e.
 by decomposing utilities in a way that quality-change can be traced to
 all composite goods whose quality is affected by the particular commodity
 (e.g.
 electricity).
 This may sound rather cumbersome, but the issue can in fact be mitigated
 if there were a recursive tree-like hierarchy of the items such as refrigerator
s that improve the quality of other goods.
 With a tree-like structure, one needs to only look at the nodes of the
 trees i.e.
 adjust the price of all food items whose quality is improved.
 In that way, instead of adjusting the price for energy, one would adjust
 the price food as well.
 It is indeed possible to write separable utility functions for all such
 node items whose quality is enhanced.
 It is clear, however, that price-adjustment for electricity would need
 to go beyond the energy-commodity-group.
 Apart from that, one would also need a detailed historical price information
 for all commodities in the context whose quality is changed due electricity
 for such a tree-structure to be set up

The model most appropriate for our study is the discrete model for utility.

\begin_layout Standard
We now comment on the status utility of the consumer.
 As we have mentioned before, we view status as the individual's place in
 a ranking order based on income, education and possession - apart from
 status derived through regional or social identities.
 The model purports that consumer gets some a status utility by simply believing
 that there is a probability of promotion of self-evaluation either by an
 expensive non-durable expenditure (denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

) or through accumulation of durable goods (when not through income, education
 and regional or social association).
 In the short-term, a consumer thus tries to optimise the utility function
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\theta,A,q)$
\end_inset

 over the short-term where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are the long-term possession, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the quantity consumed driven by needs of the consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the quality of consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are the possession owned by the consumer.
 In terms of a probabilistic model, those investing in higher-education
 etc.
 for their children are also accumulating possessions to increase the likelihood
 of higher status for their children.
\begin_inset Foot

That said, we assume that education levels and occupation levels don't change

As we are concerned primarily with a cross-sectional study in the current
 chapter, we postpone the probabilistic model until a later chapter and
 focus on how to compare of quality and status consumption in a developing
 country with that in a more developed country.
 Based on the model for long-term utility, such a comparison would involve
 two supply-side factors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cost of LTDG purchase.
 Cost of successive LTDG are more likely to be steeper in the developing
 world.
 In the consumer demand, this would lead to a more discreteness for ownership

Saving opportunities.
 As a purely supply side argument, credit is more accessible in the developed
 world.
 More advertising and a better integration through services would result
 in less incentives for saving.

 A country like Tanzania is likely to have more economic inequality and

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Descriptive statistics on the Tanzanian data are then presented.
 We focus on food expenditure - which is recorded with a greater level of
 detail than other expenditures.
 As market prices are recorded for food items, we check how the higher budget
 shares are associated with choice of higher price items.
 We find that the consumption of highest prices items doesn't always result
 in higher budget shares.
 Tea and coffee don't form the highest budget shares (while they are expensive).
 Items that are of high price and have low budget shares while having cheaper
 substitutes in the market qualify for the expensive non-durable consumption
 criteria for quality.
 Other descriptive statistics measure, e.g.
 the skewnesss of total expenditure on the item can also hint whether only
 a small proportion of population gets to spend more on the item.
 Noticeably, the budget share on skin-cream etc.
 - which we may have normally associated with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 consumption - is quite low.
 The variance on the consumption of skin-cream is in fact lower than that
 for bread or milk.
 The budget shares for cigarettes seem quite high (and quite skewed) - however,
 since there are no cheaper substitutes available we don't consider cigarettes
 as part of status consumption.
 Although the descriptive statistics seem to confirm the heuristic that
 amongst many substitutable items, the distribution of expensive varieties
 is more likely to be skewed, it is worth emphasising that neither skewness
 nor mean-cost is used as a criteria to pick items for status consumption.

\begin_layout Standard
The simple repackaging model requires that the quality variants of an item
 are perfect substitutes.
 We therefore make sure that the variants of an item in a group are near-perfect
 substitutes.
 In food, we put goat and meat in the same group - but not tea and coffee
 - because there is little sense in substitution between tea/coffee and
 goat/meat.
 The food category is in fact divided into sub-categories so that demands
 within the category can be considered separable but still lump together
 the substitutes that are of value for quality.
 Instead of having to put tea,coffee with goat,beef in high-price food categorie
s for quality, we consider put consider the high quality consumption in
 the sub-categories beverages and protein.

 - since we view the latter as cheaper sources of protein.
 For similar reasons, when analysing holiday expenses in South African data
 (IES), we don't distinguish between expensive holidays and cheaper holidays
 - but count the expenditure on holidays as expensive non-durable consumption
 under entertainment/household-consumption.
 The grouping of items is intended to achieve both separability and substitution
 for the simple repackaging model in mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many instances, one would find that the consumption items in the developed
 world have no equivalent in the developing country.
 For example, while comparing the Tanzanian data with the South African
 survey (IES), we do not find holiday expenses and car rental in the Tanzanian
 LSMS survey.
 In such cases, there is not much to be gained by sub-dividing the categories.
 Absence of sub-categories of consumption seems to provide a limit on granularit
y of the grouping of items.
 The absence of a sub-category counts as zero consumption in the parent
 category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We refrain from using detailed price of assets purchased (available in the
 Tanzanian data for 2012) - since recording of assets is different in SA
 IES and TNZ LSMS surveys.
 More particularly, the expenditure on furniture and other assets is a diary
 expenditure in the SA IES data while the assets are recorded separately
 as a recall in the Tanzanian LSMS.
 As far as possible, we avoid mixing results from recall and diary methods
 elsewhere as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recall method is particularly volatile in developing countries where
 regular payment setups are hardly a norm.
 We must be careful therefore with interpreting differences in the budget
 share over snapshots (2008,2010 and 2012) for a particular household -
 as the household may not have expenditures in all three instances of the
 survey.
 For cases such as electricity in Tanzania, we find the survey field for
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main lighting fuel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 more reliable for the test of electricity consumption than the last expenditure
 on electricity (note that kerosene is much cheaper than electricity in
 Tanzania).
 Such matters can be made worse in cases of expenditure where seasonality
 (time of the year) is also an important factor.
 To address the issue, therefore, we are careful not to draw any conclusions
 from a household's expenditure over the time-series (i.e.
 survey snapshots in 2008, 2010 and 2012) - but rely on the average expenditure
 by a collection of households (in a particular region etc.) over time.

 new items (loosely determining the barriers to status) of key importance.

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

) and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that
 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.

The preliminary analysis is presented first without the simple repackaging
 formulation and then with the simple repackaging formulation.
 We use the constrained regression to ensure the conditions of adding-up
 are met.
 The effect of assets is only modelled as a dummy variable (low-price, medium-pr
ice and high-price assets).
 The results from a differences-model and quantile regression are also presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the second part of econometric analysis is to see how long-term
 status needs of the consumers - fulfilled with purchase of assets (which
 translates into an upward movement in status in our model) relate with
 the short-term needs fulfilled with expensive non-durable consumption.
 Much the way we were wary of claiming that consumption on items indicates
 perception of status hierarchies, we don't claim that the observed social
 mobility - recorded in this way - serves as a measure of how status is
 perceived in society.
 The variation in the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC) across occupation
 ranks, education, social identities and the assets owned across the two
 countries (see quantile regression results) only tells how quality consumption
 segmented in the two economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the model doesn't require that a consumer purchase a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

composite item
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of quality (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities"

\end_inset

).
 Instead, we believe that quality is a concern for the researcher and not
 for the consumer - who merely exercises her choice given the set of products
 available in the market for given prices (see the clarification from Nelson
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

).
 Since status would always be priced in the market, a status item would
 be always more expensive than the rest of the items which provide the same
 functionality (see Chao et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chao1998"

\end_inset

 for substantiation of this argument).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that medium assets seem limited to the cities - and the
 households in the rural areas miss out on ownership of these assets.
 There are less opportunities for expensive non-durable consumption in the
 rural parts of Tanzania - except for marriage - where the expenditure seems
 proportionally high.
 The differences in the life-styles (quality consumption) between rural
 and urban areas in the developing countries results in less dependence
 on assets.
 Status is more likely to be derived from what is available as assets in
 the rural areas - compared to a more advanced economy such as that of South
 Africa.

LatexCommand cite
key "KausSA"

\end_inset

) considers a black-dummy and coloured-dummy in regression of visible consumptio
n against demographic, time, permanent income and household characteristics.
 Starting with no controls(I) (with black-dummy and coloured-dummy), the
 coefficients for coloured and black are negative (i.e.
 black and coloured social groups spend less on visible consumption than
 the white population).
 However, these coefficients flip signs after adding income controls(II).
 The coefficients for black and coloured groups are even higher when expenditure
 is added(III).
 Kaus et al argue that the endogeneity of total expenditure requires instrumenta
tion and use the instruments suggested by Charles, Roussanov and Hurst
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

 - including positive-income-dummy, cube-of-income-level, dummies for under-seco
ndary-education, secondary-education and degree-education.
 A set of two 2SLS regressions are then performed - one with income controls
 and total-expenditure as control variablesand the other with education-dummies
 as control variables (while still using instruments).
 The instrumentation thus performed (Specification IV in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "resresults-1"

\end_inset

) results in lower coefficients for the black and coloured dummies for both
 regressions.
 When demographic params are added(VI), the coefficients are further lowered
 - for both types of regressions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-change of sign when income controls are added implies that after
 accounting for income of household head, the coloured and black groups
 spend more on visible consumption.
 Total expenditure is not a perfect proxy of permanent income - which justifies
 instrumentation.
 Adding demographic controls to the 2SLS regression - shows significance
 of age, urban/rural area and family size - but coefficients are still not
 lowered significantly.
 This confirms that coloured and black social groups spend a rather disproportio
nate amount on visible consumption.
 To test whether the rise in average group income reduces the visible consumptio
n, a regression with average-incomes of particular provinces for every group
 (black/white/coloured) shows a higher effect of income on black-social-group
 than the white-social-group - a difference that author argues points out
 alternate ways of signaling for white-social-group relative to black-social-gro
up.

Historical developments in sub-Saharan Africa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The landscape of the political history of sub-Saharan African is dominated
 by anti-colonial movements in the past century.
 While it seems natural to hope for Adam Smith's principles to take hold
 in the nascent economies of the newly formed republics in the sub-Saharan
 Africa, neither the economic development nor the collective defense of
 nationalistic interests have followed a path similar to that of the developed
 world.
 The industrial class in the African countries is still poor in absolute
 terms and the problems of extreme poverty have remained largely unresolved
 in the large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa.
 The administrative successes and stabilities of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before.
 The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires,
 for example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries
 when compared to the administrative units (much as the political boundaries
 themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The processes of decolonization - which started in the late last century
 - have encompassed the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia
 and Africa aspiring to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 (often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike) their reach and success has been limited.
 in the developing world is that the goals aimed for by Adam Smith - of
 replacing feudalistic rent-seeking with fairness, equity and reward for
 hard-work - have been attempted more often with the nationalistic or socialist
 movements than free trade.
 The role of state has been an uncertain force in the developing world and
 has thus shaped identities at least as much as the evolution of market
 for industrial goods have.

The access to education is varied in Nigeria - because of the different
 levels of successes missionary education had in Nigeria.
 This in turn has created regional disparities in the current education
 levels between the northern and southern parts of Nigeria.
 The north has had a higher Islamic influence and the uniformity desired
 by the post-colonial government had had some initial challenges.
 At the start of the republic, it seemed that the market forces had been
 left relatively untouched - due to nature of the British rule which encouraged
 participation of a native authority.
 At the same time, the wage labour surviving on the peasantry was a trend
 that continued well into the post-colonial era.
 When the movements of African socialism in Nigeria picked up their momentum,
 the power of merchant class became limited.
 In the more recent decades, when MNCs could have brought more power to
 a working middle class, their presence hasn't changed the state of capital
 being controlled by a small minority - an environment where only the state
 monopolized industries and the informal sector seem to have expanded

 The recent Base of Pyramid (BoP) initiatives have not created a sufficient
 base for entrepreneurs, but they have indeed revived a focus on education
 and expanded the market for industrial goods.

Given its engagement in the liberation movements in Mozambique in 1974 and
 the faith in planned economy inculcated by Nyrere, it would not be inaccurate
 to consider Tanzania the epicentre of the African socialism.
 But once the political independence was achieved in Tanzania, the membership
 of nationalist parties declined and the separation of civil service from
 political institutions became less of a priority.
 The faith in socialist planning under the leadership of Nyrere meant that
 the reduction of private sector did not experience much opposition.
 With a lack of support from its workers and a ban on producer-consumer
 societies, the socialist model seemed to have had some inconsistencies.
 In the decades after the independence, the industrial sector continued
 to suffer because of import subsidies.
 An import substituting industrialization (ISI) led to oversubsidizing when
 the need to prevent mass starvation called for an adjustment to capital
 flows.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and the use of a capital-intensive technology
 caused the oversubsidizing to spread further across other sectors.
 Subsequently, an over-reliance on capital for development resulted in decline
 of the industrial capacity utilization
