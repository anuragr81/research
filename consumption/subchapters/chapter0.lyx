A Historical Context of Status Differences in the sub-Saharan Africa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The developments of the last century in Africa and Asia - bear some similarity
 with the rise of a middle class in the post-medieval Europe.
 In both Asia and Africa, a new working class has clashed with and replaced
 the feudal or colonial systems of the century before.
 The growing competitions for status amongst the nascent working classes
 have been a subject of sociological study in the late 20th century.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, this competition was termed as Sanskritizat
ion when erstwhile lower classes emulated higher social classes with newly
 acquired economic freedoms

 Elsewhere too, the habits of the upper economic classes expanded to middle
 and lower classes with urban developments over the decades following the
 second world war (see section).

 that the nationalist developments had promised in the developing world
 have materialised.
 The industrial class in the African countries is still poor in absolute
 terms and the problems of extreme poverty have remained largely unresolved
 in large swathes of Asia and Africa.
 The administrative successes and stabilities of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before

The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires, for
 example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries

.
 The political landscape of many Asian and African economies is dominated
 by the effects of decolonization in the late last century - a process that
 encompasses the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia and Africa
 aspiring to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 (often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike) their limited reach and success leaves the possibility of having
 left the status differences intact.

Institutions of a society are critical in both maintaining the purchasing
 power of its individuals and engineering a certain faith in equality, fairness
 and social mobility amidst them.
 The strength of institutions are varied in the developing world and measuring
 the effect of cultural contexts on the status consumption across countries
 spread across continents often requires excessive generalisations.
 Since we have limited our scope to status competitions, we focus only on
 the differences in status in the respective societies.
 Further, we express status strictly in terms of possessions - which are
 acquired through income and purchase of items.
 Instead of dealing with the problem of measuring status perceptions in
 a society, therefore, we limit ourselves to the characteristics that may
 represent status in a society.

Tanzania was no less than an epicentre for the African socialism movements.
 In 1974, it was even interested in Mozambique to assist in liberation movements.
 Planned economy seemed the way forward under influence of Nyrere.

 nationalist parties declined and soon the separation of civil service from
 political institutions became less important.

The reduction of private sector didn't experience much opposition under
 leadership of Nyrere.
 With lack of support from workers and ban of producer-consumer societies,
 inconsistencies surfaced in the socialist model.
 The industrial sector also suffered because of import subsidies.
 The approach of ISI (import substituting industrialization) led to oversubsidiz
ing when capital flows had to be adjusted to prevent starvation.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and usage of a capital-intensive technology
 soon resulted in oversubsidizing across sectors, over-reliance on capital
 for development and a consequent decline in capacity utilization of the
 industry

Status and Consumption in the Developing world
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in purchasing power between the sections of a society and
 the mobility between them are key drivers of status-related consumption.
 That status and mobility can contribute to the economic development of
 a society is a belief that goes back to Adam Smith - who had proposed that
 the economic progress can be achieved by letting an exchange between the
 rich and poor thrive.
 To use Wicksteed's words, trinkets could be turned into bread in this world-vie
w
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 One could argue that more spending on a conspicuous item would benefit
 the society as a whole - since the money obtained from the rich on the
 item could potentially fund employment and other opportunities.
 Electricity in Africa, for example, would be a model item for this purpose
 - an item whose consumption can drive the expansion of power plants and
 make electricity cheaper for everyone.
 More spending on signaling goods does not appear to be a social waste from
 this perspective.
 However, we note that not all marketable goods are as desirable as electricity
 and there may be goals more desirable than what the exchange between rich
 and poor can provide.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the developed world, the differences between the rich and poor have purported

\end_inset

.
 In the developing world, on the other hand, the basic needs for the masses
 have still not been addressed.
 One could expect the exchange between rich and poor to draw the masses
 out of poverty - but we argue that there are limits to how much success
 can be achieved in the developing countries - the essential goods often
 lack robust markets in the developing countries and since marketable goods
 often create needs on their own, the development of market for conspicuous
 goods may prevent the status competitions from achieving the goals of social
 welfare.
 More so in the context of conspicuous consumption than elsewhere, an commodity
 exclusively available to the richer sections of the society can easily
 become a status good and thus the possibility of a social waste due to
 spending on status goods cannot be ruled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In other words, the limitations of status competitions matter in the developing
 world because the institutions in these countries are generally weak and
 have developed on the path to achieving goals of nationalism.
 The developing countries often face the problem of institutions just not
 being strong enough to allow the exchange between the rich and the poor
 to thrive.
 In the new urban settings in Africa, both tribal identities and the hierarchies
 formed through education, money or industrial assets can contribute to
 status competitions.
 While this development can encourage institutions of money and education
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Status differences can spur consumption on status goods - and can be particularl

 can limit themselves to markets not developed enough to undertake severe
 scarcities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The relationship between education, urban developments, income levels and
 tribal identities is difficult to assess without the access to the microdata
 on tribal identities and regional migration.
 In absence of this data (as is the case with LSMS used in the study), we
 consider other proxies that may be correlated with social identities (e.g.
 family income levels, language spoken, locality etc.

 Still, the measurement error for variables in any claimed relationship
 between identity and purchasing power in Africa can be severe - due to
 a bulky informal sector (which may have expanded due to recent economic
 developments), expansions in the areas of micro-credit as well as mass
 education

We only consider district level residence and primary spoken language as

 oneself.

\paragraph_spacing single
While the buyer of an item indicates her status to the immediate local surroundi
ngs through her consumption, the items she ends up buying depend on more
 than just her preferences - since there can be wide disparities in the
 environments where consumers in a population reside.
 If the items available to the consumers in different regions within an
 economy are disparate, then it is no longer trivial to identify items relevant
 for status and infer demographic unevenness in the purchase of status items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's take example of the availability of electricity in Tanzania.
 If only the rich could afford electricity, then it being used by a smaller
 and richer part of the population may seem to have less significance than
 weddings - which are ubiquitous in the population (a regression with quantities
 consumed as dependent variable would bear more significance for items consumed
 by more consumers).
 One may be tempted to argue that items consumed by more people carry more
 significance for status than the item that is hardly accessible to the
 wider population, but status in a society is driven by both the supply
 of the item and the ability of the individual to purchase the item (disposable
 income).
 The interplay of supply, wealth and assets determine status in a society
 and thus belonging to a region or a social network where an asset is available
 asymmetrically, would also drive status.

Overcrowding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While supply and wealth influence the long-term development of status, the
 introduction of new industrial goods can create demands and distort the
 distribution of resources (through industrial development, migrations etc.)
 in the short-run.
 With the introduction of a new status item e.g.
 a new electronic product, there is a tendency amongst the consumers to
 flock towards the item.
 The demand for certain status items is enhanced by the popularity of the
 item itself.
 Enhanced by the advertising effects, such items often create a market of
 their own.
 This so-called

Empirically, the change of the budget share (or elasticities) of the item
 over a time-period with respect to lagged consumption, income and supply
 can indicate how such a bandwagon-effect develops.
 The budget share for an item can shift when its supply is increased (more
 electrical power plants or cheaper alternative energy would reduce the
 budget share on electricity).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Not all status goods need to exhibit flocking of consumers.
 If the item has been restricted to the richer section of the society for
 a long time, then increase in abundance of the item can actually cause
 disinterest in that item.
 These are considered the snob items in literature

 the decline in signaling qualities of an item when the consumers use it
 too much - essentially points to the existence of snob items.

 As new items can always appear in the market through innovation or imports,
 a consumer uses both snob and bandwagon items to indicate her status.

The demand for industrial goods is particularly relevant in the sub-Saharan
 African context.
 As discussed in previous sections, the outreach and resources of the government

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The small-scale private enterprise - which forms the majority of non-agrarian
 workforce in sub-Saharan Africa - receives very little governmental assistance
 and hence the expansion of informal economy has continued with the migration
 to urban areas increasing significantly over the last decades.
 The interaction between urban and rural regions is of significance to any
 study of consumption in the sub-Saharan Africa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Often viewed as a necessary phase of development, urban migration leads
 to the competition between industrial and agricultural sectors for labour
 and food ( see Lewis
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 model - which expects the prices of food to rise as labour moves from agricultu
re to industry).
 In our view, the flight to urban areas is not merely an escape from despondent
 circumstances but also the access to an expanded consumption basket and
 a chance for improbable social mobilities.
 The introduction of industrial goods and the status needs of the consumers
 is therefore relevant to the trend of urban migration in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The observation that the indigenes have recently displaced non-indigenes
 or the more educated have replaced the less educated in conventional occupation
s in many sub-Saharan African countries for example, may very well have
 a detectable impact on status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the data on social identity was not available for this study, we have
 used population density to proxy some of the effects of migration.
 We observe that the population density bears significance with consumption
 of items relevant for status.
 If similar products were available in both rural and urban areas, one may
 expect that the more communication between individuals that may potentially
 intensify the bandwagon effects and status competitions.
 While studying the effect of social interaction on income distribution,
 for example, Robert H.
 Frank (

 In the data we used from LSMS for Tanzania, however, the lack of availability

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

 region and same employment-type have reasonably similar incomes.
 The variance in incomes recorded for the same local group can give an estimate
 of how noisy the data is due to self-reporting.

 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{skincreamconsu}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that
 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.

The first-change of sign when income controls are added implies that after
 accounting for income of household head, the coloured and black groups
 spend more on visible consumption.
 Total expenditure is not a perfect proxy of permanent income - which justifies
 instrumentation.
 After resolving these endogeneity concerns - with a regression of visible
 expenditure as dependent variable and total-expenditure as one of the control
 variables - the signs are revised - although 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 does not change a lot.
 Adding demographic controls to the 2SLS regression - shows significance
 of age, urban/rural area and family size - but coefficients are still not
 lowered significantly.
 This confirms that coloured and black social groups spend a rather disproportio
nate amount on visible consumption.
 Kaus paper is interested in testing whether the rise in average group income
 reduces the visible consumption.
 The regression considers average-incomes of particular provinces for every
 group (black/white/coloured).
 This regression shows the effect more on black-social-group than the white-soci
al-group - a difference that author argues points out alternate ways of
 signaling for white-social-group relative to black-social-group.

\begin_layout Standard
For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, there were some
 necessary adjustments to be made for the classification of non-durable
 consumption into the wider categories of food, energy, transport, social
 functions, personal products, education and housing.
 The adjustments related to extrapolation of costs 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Repairs and maintenance costs etc.
 are provided in the weekly diary - but they cannot be simply extrapolated
 to annual consumption without a consideration of the average life of the
 item being repaired or maintained.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 were trivial, while others related to classification anomalies were resolved
 using the context of the item's utility.
 If the item performs two functions e.g.
 a musical instrument (or any entertainment-related item), it could be classifie
d either as an appliance or a personal product.
 The social context of the item's usage helps resolve this ambiguity.
 Similarly, the regional variation and supply-asymmetries related to the
 item can also complicate how an item is classified.
 Mosquito-nets (which available in the survey), for example, may seem relevant
 to land & housing - and therefore relevant for potential status value.
 However, they can hardly be considered a candidate for pecuniary emulation
 - since there is no asset which a consumer overspends on mosquito nets
 to compensate for.
 Moreover, even if there was price differentiation in mosquito-nets (and
 we were to consider them for status consumption), we would need to observe
 the effect of climate on the consumption - since the need for mosquito
 nets is removed in a drier and cooler climate.
 Just the way one cannot view the lack of electricity (or a similar commodity)
 within a region as the consumers' lack of preference towards it in the
 region, one cannot view any other item whose distribution is skewed due
 to region without considering the region of availability as a control variable.
 While we do include region in all our analysis (see expensiveregion dummy
 in the results), there are cases when consumption may be driven by unobserved
 variables (e.g.
 insurance costs associated with theft frequencies).
 In such cases, we have no choice but to remove the item from the consideration
 towards status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Housing and education are worth commenting further.
 Education is included in the total expenditure as is rental expenditure.
 However, we do not consider house rent as part of housing-related expenditure
 - simply because our goal is to measure the expenditure on items common
 for those who rent a house and those who own it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We thus test for the two effects which we have discussed earlier.
 First is the test of pecuniary emulation - to check if those with fewer
 assets tend to spend more in certain categories.
 Second is the test of influence of availability on the budget shares for
 certain comomdities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
We use four types of assets in the regression - housing (house ownership),
 agricultural (ploughs,tractors etc.), electric (electricity driven appliances)
 and equipment (furniture etc.).
 The housing types 1,2,3 represent owned, rented and free housing types
 respectively.
 The results are presented in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabwlogx}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We can see that the expenditure on personal products is higher for renters
 when compared to those who own a house.
 Renters tend to spend less on housing related items and proportionately
 less on education too.
 This could be seen as an evidence of pecuniary emulation - but the evidence
 for such a tendency is weak - outside of housing.
 Those who own electricity driven assets spend more on both energy and personal
 products.
 Those who don't own a car or other means of transport don't spend more
 on personal products - instead they seem to pay quite a bit for public
 transport.
 Further, those with less equipment (and less assets in general) spend a
 higher portion of their income on food.
 Within the categories, we can see the role of sparsely available commodities.
 Energy has clear segregation (difference in budget shares) due to electricity,
 education has one due to preference for the English language and so on.
 Items that are sparsely available in other categories are shown in the
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:rare_items"

\end_inset

.
 As is clear from the table, there are more severe inequalities that exist
 in rural areas for items in categories other than food (.e.
 no substitutes are available for the sparsely available item in the rural
 areas).
