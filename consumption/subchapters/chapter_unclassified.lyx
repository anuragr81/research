\begin_layout Standard
Status consumption is defined as status goods - but status goods may be
 just wealth in the developing countries.
 Reference levels are important everywhere.
 Needs can help us but it is the reference level with respect to personal
 characteristics that determines would set the reference level for consumption.
 A universal set of needs is a difficult concept and needs interpretation
 (see Sen).
 A consideration of non-durable consumption and durable goods in view of
 the reference groups is therefore adopted in the current chapter.
 Visible consumption is relevant but not more than wealth (the car analogy).

\begin_layout Standard
The above argument highlights a fundamental way in which our model differs
 from a visible consumption model.
 That all consumers could achieve a gain in social hierarchy through consumption
 - implies that there is a private utility to be derived from status consumption
 in the model.
 While visible consumption is meant to provide only a public utility (and
 no private utility), we view the race for higher status through consumption
 as a probabilistic (risky) step forward in the social hierarchy.
 A luxury watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared to
 its cheaper alternatives with same functionality), but if an aspiring businessm
an uses his knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business,
 then the futile consumption can translate into a material advantage.
 The perception of status - however unrealistic - can influence one's wealth
 if everyone in one's reference group also acts in accordance to the perception
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It may be apt to consider conspicuous consumption futile but only in a sense
 that is different from what a modeler would be concerned with.
 Items like luxury watches are important only because the rich flock around
 them.
 Thus if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
\end_layout

\end_inset

and provides a social network where material success is either maintained
 or provided.
 The peer effects that conspicuous items accompany is important (not futile)
 as it acts as a means of connecting the rich with the not-so rich.
 Indeed only a few of the purchasers of luxury watches would improve their
 self-image while enhancing their social networks - while others may remain
 mere purchasers.
 What matters is that a certain number of buyers of luxury watches actually
 achieve success over the long term and influence the peers in their reference
 group whose members can observe the success of someone in their reference
 group
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We are not concerned with how many of the businessmen actually believe that
 conspicuous consumption would help them (i.e.
 we do not attempt to describe their beliefs and are only interested in
 modeling the probability of their success in the long-term).
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both quality and durable goods matter.
 The approach is different from permanent income.
 The effects of wealth is different form income.
 Wealth - proxied with long-term durable goods is not always going to move
 together with non-durable consumption.
 We define cost of durable goods plus the needs - as a normalisation of
 how durable goods control non-durable consumption - this contributes to
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 the other component is the quality in non-durable consumption - which is
 everything non-needs.
 This should not appear as trivialisation of status consumption.
 For a definition of quality, needs are not enough so a cost function related
 to durable goods is necessary.
 This is to only make the definition of quality clearer.
 The two-period solution show how consumer would be encouraged to consumer
 quality - how the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is important.
 Peer effects can be added to the model if we consider quality aggregated
 over 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 This can be extended to multiple periods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
A consideration of the costs of durable goods available to the consumer
 also allows us to standardise the conditions over which the demand for
 status-related consumption can be conditioned over for a comparison of
 status consumption in two different economies (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The costs of assets available to the consumer allow us to standardise the
 conditions over which the demand for status-related consumption can be
 conditioned over.
 If status consumption were to be compared in two different economies with
 disparate levels of economic development (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy), a comparison of distribution
 of assets characterises the differences in the two econmomies.
 For a set of assets (long-term durable goods) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

 ordered by increasing cost, the difference in successive costs i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta d_{j}=d_{j}-d_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}\in\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}<d_{j}\forall(i<j)$
\end_inset

 may be much higher relative to the cost of quality consumption in a less
 developed economy.
 The cost of the next asset to be purchased may in turn affect the consumer's
 non-durable consumption.
 The costlier long-term assets may discourage savings for the future (the
 consumer may give up hopes of acquiring assets if she is to remain in a
 low income group relative to asset costs).
 Similarly, the perceptions of high mobility may encourage the consumer
 to overspend on quality in the short-term (matching one's consumption to
 one's perceived status).
 The expenditure on quality relative to purchase of long-term assets therefore
 provides us a way to compare the status consumption in two disparate economies.
 We present the results from the model estimated for the Tanzanian LSMS
 data for the years 2010, 2012 and 2014 in the current chapter.

Since needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

, income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$

\end_inset

 are independent of the estimation of the Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Old Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand how the function 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset


\series default
 may be fitted with empirical data, consider a set of items say 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0},I_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

 over which the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is selected by the consumer.
 The items 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0},I_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{3}$
\end_inset

 have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0},p_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}<p_{1}<p_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the item with the lowest available quality (hence the minimum price
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

).
 Assuming that the quantity needed for minimum needs per head is 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, two consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{10}q_{11})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{20},q_{22})$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is quantity consumed of item 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 by the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 - would effectively set 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\nu_{1}p_{0}=\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{1k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}\nu_{2}=\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{2k}$
\end_inset

.
 The value of the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{i\in[1,2]}$
\end_inset

 represents merely the distance from the fulfillment of the basic needs
 i.e.
 the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}$
\end_inset

 and represents the consumer preference for quality within a certain commodity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The form of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstoch"

\end_inset

 follows from this basic view of quality control.
 Consider a consumer facing only the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 for item 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

, so that all items other than the item 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 have been removed from her basket (or the market accessible to her).
 The likely effect of having just the quantity consumed as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{10}$
\end_inset

 is thus be to reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{1k}=p_{0}q_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}<p_{1}<p_{2}$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice however, that the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}\ge1$
\end_inset

 still applies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The effect of having constraints on quality due to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is thus equivalent to addition or removal of items from the consumer basket.
 If a rural consumer who has access to only some of the items from the urban
 basket (which an urban consumer has access to), the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 she chooses is equivalent to removing some items from the urban consumer's
 basket.
 Thus the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can also be seen as a filter on the set of prices of a basket of all items
 (i.e.
 items available at a national level or at the respective top level of granulari
ty in an empirical) that returns the costs pertinent to owned asset level
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Equivalently, when the consumer acquires more assets, her basket effectively
 expands as she is forced to be away from basic needs consumption cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Potentially, the effects of regional variation in the basket (more items
 within a commodity) on the varied consumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can also be accommodated with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 by treating the additional expenditure on quality in an expensive region
 - where the basket is more varied - as a cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While this approach hasn't been followed in our empirical analyses, the
 filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can be used to standardise the supply conditions in a more general analysis
 - e.g.
 in a comparison of demand between two disparate economies.
 For example, in the more developed market, one expects to see rental options,
 availability of cheaper substitutes or extension of credit facilities to
 the consumer for an durable good that is too expensive for her.
 This contrast in the supply conditions would have two effects on the consumer
 demand.
 First, the difference between successive asset costs in an order of assets
 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{i}=A_{i}-A_{i-1}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula ${A_{i}}={A_{1}<A_{2}<A_{3}}$
\end_inset

) would be lower in the more developed market because the market would make
 cheaper alternatives available to the consumer.
 Second, a lot of assets can be availed without ownership in the developed
 market.
 To consider a particular example of car ownership, we would see both that
 the cars can be enjoyed with a frequent non-durable cost (rental) rather
 than through ownership and that the cars are available in a wider range
 of costs in the developed market.
 Standardsing the supply conditions in the two economies with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 would imply a less discrete distribution of assets in the developed market
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) so that the same level of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 may correspond to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho$
\end_inset

) in the developed market.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

, one may use either the form involving 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ModelDynamics"

\end_inset

 or plugin the costs associated with assets that are observed in the consumption
 diary directly as the output of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

.
 A sound definition of long-term assets and an appropriate form of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 is necessary - as both the approaches are susceptible to measurement errors
 associated with the ownership and inter-generational transfer of assets.
 Empirically, we determine a long-term asset for the particular household
 as any good that has an expected lifetime long enough to be passed on to
 the owner's progeny.
 Recall that based on the arguments in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"

\end_inset

, a good that can't be passed on isn't long-term for the purposes of the
 current model and would not cause any observable change in the expected
 social mobility.
 Such consumption (inclusive of any status consumption through quality)
 is considered non-durable for our purposes and would not serve as an input
 to the process 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 - which returns only maintenance fees, rents or running costs associated
 with the ownership of long-term assets or maintenance of a certain characterist
ics (e.g.
 educational level, club membership etc.
 The costs such as maintenance fees or running costs can only contribute
 indirectly to the consumer's status-utility through the ownership of assets
 that impose such the costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To infer the non-durable costs incurred from assets (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t}.\rho)$
\end_inset

 ), we also use the average operation for some of the assets.
 For example, a refrigerator - which is expected to run 24 hrs a day - would
 have a different electricity requirement and hence the running costs compared
 to an electrical stove or agricultural equipment which is used less sparingly.
 On the other hand, the running costs for entertainment boats or musical
 equipment - whose running time is controlled by the user and is associated
 with leisure - are not considered part of the quality constraint.
 Other than the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, the price filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 also depends on the personal characteristics which may impose a certain
 lifestyle or habit on the consumer.
 For example, the consumers living in a remote area may have a zero consumption
 for certain commodities (
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 for a certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These discrete effects cannot be modeled when using the approximation of
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$

\end_inset

 in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 (as is done in the particular function for the solution discussed in Section

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, for the estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha/\beta$
\end_inset

, we consider a simple sum of quality control variables across commodities.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 commodities (e.g.
 food, energy etc.), if we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1,t}=(1+\nu_{1,t})\eta_{t}\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $c_{2,t}=(1+\nu_{2,t})\eta_{t}\Psi_{t}$

The function also accommodates the observation that the families in the

 due to the joint-family structure prevalent in the societies ( observe

 Instead of using the number of children as a measure of the needs of the
 household, we estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t,T)$

 using the total number of dependents for the individual household head
 over her lifetime.
 For the empirical analysis, adult dependents in a household are those who

 - assuming that the age would determine the expected family member size
 (this isn't true in the longer-run as the population structure, fertility

Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the effects of on consumption are modeled explicitly, it would suffice
 if the income process models only the monetary growth i.e.
 a reflection of the steady growth in the economy on the consumer's budget
 (in analysis of the Tanzanian data in the current chapter, an income process
 dependent on long-term characteristics such as education and occupation
 is assumed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the income process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

, we use the reported income from primary occupations in the Tanzania LSMS
 data over the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 One limitation of the Tanzanian LSMS data is that it does not provide income
 data for every household head for which the consumption diary and durable
 goods are recorded.
 Another limitation of the data set is that a household that is visited
 in a particular year is less likely to be visited after more than 2 years.
 This means that while a significant number households would be common between
 2010 and 2012 as well as between 2012 and 2014, very few households that
 were visited in 2010 would be visited the third time in 2014 (in fact less
 than 100 household from the survey in 2010 seem to be visited in 2014 for
 income survey).
 Such a lack of a true panel data compels us to prepare a pseudo-panel for
 the calibration of the income process.
 The pseudo-panel we prepare is based on the similarity of the number of
 adults, the number of children, the year of birth of the adults, the occupation
 and education levels
\begin_inset Foot

A minor issue encountered while the preparation of the pseudo-panel related
 to the age of the household members was circumvented with an approximate
 matching of that year-of-birth values.
 The LSMS community survey appears to have recorded the year-of-birth values
 for individuals in years 2010 and 2012 but the age variable is recorded
 instead for the year 2014.
 Matching the year-of-birth values from 2012 with the YOB values inferred
 from the recorded age was made possible by allowing a tolerance for matching
 the YOB values for the preparation of the pseudo-panel.

Use of Stochastic Utility in Estimation

\begin_layout Standard
The discrete choice utility does not come into until we want to handle the
 effect of long-term choices.
 If we're willing to consider characteristics like education, region, home-owner
ship or occupation as permanent for the representative consumer, then we
 don't need the discrete choice.
 It's only when we use a dynamic model for making these choices - i.e.
 whether a consumer could move to a different locality, buy a house etc.
 is when we need to model the discrete choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that we don't need to consider discrete choice for whether the consumer
 buys and asset or not.
 Since we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 separate from 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

, the asset account tracks the assets purchased.
 We only consider the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

realised
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 value of this account - i.e.
 we assume that consumer purchases an asset as soon has she has accumulated
 enough value in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 - assets grow in value at the same rate as the cash (which is not a far-fetched
 assumption given the minimal credit services in the developing economies).
\end_layout

The important things to remember is that individuals may not behave but
 the structures they operate within are set up based on rational constraints
 on their behaviour.
 These constraints are based on certain aspects of the group behaviour that
 are part of a rational world used by the firms and institutions.
 So there are systematic/rational aspects of the behaviour and the idiosyncratic
 parts.

The current analysis uses the McFadden

.
 In a more traditional model, one would discount the projections of savings
 and non-durable consumption subject to a wealth constraint - and associate
 a stochastic component to the consumers decisions.
 The model we use is based on McFadden's approach where utility is decomposed
 into a systematic component and a random component i.e.
 a decision maker chooses and option 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 amongst 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 alternatives where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}=V_{i}+\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the systematic utility - a deterministic function of observed variables
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 the random utility.

 then goes on to seek probability distribution function of

\end_inset

 and arrives at the conditions for an empirically solvable logit model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
McFadden's is essentially a technique to model the discrete choice of a
 consumer.
 In our case, whether the consumer saves for purchasing an asset or not
 is the discrete choice - particularly so because the savings rate of the
 consumer is an unobserved variable.
 In a time-series formulation we may use a general stochastic form of this
 process and associate it with the probability of acquiring assets
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the general approach for evolution of the savings rate, the consumer
 would have a certain expected savings process - whose expectation (or discounti
ng) would determine the participation in quality while the evolution of
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}$
\end_inset

 itself would determine We assume that the utility of the consumer evolves
 with a general stochastic process the
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(A_{t},\eta_{t})$

 The status of the individual would be implied both with 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

- but is immaterial for the evolution itself - which depends only on the

 While an explicit solution is not always possible, a numerical solution
 for such processes can be obtained with a Monte Carlo simulation.

 - but for now, our goal is to view how the consumer may exercise the choice
 to purchase and asset or not.
 The asset states that the consumer enters in are - the low band, the medium-low
 band, the medium-high band and the high band - these constitute the asset
 order we have talked about in the previous sections.

\begin_layout Standard
Let the utility of the consumer be 
\begin_inset Formula $U(A,\kappa,\eta)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 represents the needs of the consumer.
 A key argument here is that the tendency to expand one's needs also adds
 to the felicity (utility) of the consumer.
 That the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 should be parameters with respect to which the 
\begin_inset Formula $U(A,\kappa,\eta)$
\end_inset

 is non-decreasing, needs little explanation but the argument that utility
 also increases with respect to needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 relies on the life-cycle hypothesis - which considers how an individual
 obtains a stable income before expanding her family and sheds off assets
 acquired over the active years - enabling the further generations to replicate
 that same behaviour.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 as non-stochastic components and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 as the stochastic components imply a model where consumer makes the discrete
 choice of purchasing an asset while getting a non-stochastic utility from
 quality of consumption.
 An individual who considers two choices 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{1},\kappa_{1},\eta_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{2},\kappa_{2},\eta_{2})$
\end_inset

 would thus choose 1 over 2 if :

Following the McFadden

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that it is possible to decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $U(A_{i},\kappa_{i},\eta_{i})$
\end_inset

 into non-stochastic and stochastic components, we can write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S(A_{i},\kappa_{i},\eta_{i})$

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $U(A_{i},k_{i},\eta_{i})=V_{i}+S_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}=P(U(A_{i},\kappa_{i},\eta_{i})-U(A_{j},\kappa_{j},\eta_{j})>0)=P(V_{i}+S_{i}-V_{j}-S_{j}>0)=P(S_{j}-S_{i}>V_{i}-V_{j}$

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Results from Stochastic Utility Approaches
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that our notion of quality is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality of life
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in general - but simply the quality of non-durable consumption.
 The differences in quality of assets can also exist for the consumer but
 we recognise that owned assets are of less importance within certain commodity
 groups (see condition C1).
 To quantify some of these notions of life-style choices through quality
 and assets, we now outline a model for intertemporal choice that would
 be developed further in later sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a long-term direct utility that the consumer optimises such
 that it is a function of the needs, the assets she possesses and the quality
 of her non-durable consumption.
 Considering two consumers in the urban and rural areas with the assets,
 quality and needs being 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{u},\rho_{u},\eta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{r},\eta)$
\end_inset

 respectively (for simplicity, we have set 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{u}=\eta_{r}=\eta$
\end_inset

), a non-decreasing utility would mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}\Rightarrow u(A_{u},\rho_{u})>u(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

.
 It is also possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

 are not defined since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u},\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

 may not be available to the rural consumer.
 Notice that we don't consider income as an input to the long-term utility.
 This is because we assume that the utility of income is realised with the
 purchases of assets and quality.
 For the urban and the rural consumer, as an example, having a refrigerator
 or a car would be more noticeable than the income itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A non-decreasing utility also implies that for a rural consumer who does
 not possess a refrigerator to have the same utility as her urban counterpart,
 she would have to purchase a higher quality i.e.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{u},)=u(A_{r},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}>\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

.
 While a particular form of this social function 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 may help us understand how a consumer compensates for not having an asset,
 it is the relevance of such choices to the observed consumption data that
 concerns us more in an empirical analysis.
 A utility function that we desire should help us quantitatively explain
 for example - how much more furniture for a rural consumer would make her
 indifferent to owning electrical assets (and less furniture) in an urban
 area.
 It should also explain whether higher priced assets always provide a higher
 long-term utility to a consumer etc..
 With vast differences in income and wealth that exist in many of the developing
 countries, we believe such questions ought to be considered in any discussion
 on consumption of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To model the sharp (discrete) differences in life-style choices and the
 unobservable factors that create them, we introduce an uncertainty in the
 long-term utility - so that our representative consumer who has a higher
 value of owned assets has only a probabilistic higher long-term utility.
 The long-term utility in the model is incremented in a deterministic fashion
 only with the assets that can be transferred over generations (including
 education, language spoken and occupational ranks) while the immediate
 enhancements to felicity, improvement in self-image - all contribute as
 less deterministic factors to the long-term utility.
 Thus our representative consumer may not gain any long-term benefits from
 an immediate felicity and the stochastic factors other than a better self-image
 and social environment which would in turn help her in acquiring assets
 in the longer run.
 We claim that as long as an empirical distinction between quality, needs
 and assets can be made, the consumption of quality would reflect the self-image
 of the consumer - i.e.
 her expectations of a future improvement of the long-term standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an important advantage in the empirical work with the differentiation
 of assets from quality in the above fashion - particularly so if one were
 to extend the notion of long-term utility to status-related consumption.
 While the literature on conspicuous consumption often relies on Veblen's
 futility assumption for conspicuous items - treating status goods as those
 that offer no true utility - our approach may allow all items to contribute
 to status by letting every purchase of any kind improve one's relative
 position in the society.
 A good would contribute to utility by offering i) an immediate benefit
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(\eta)$
\end_inset

 ii) an expectation of self-improvement 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho)$
\end_inset

 and iii) a definite long-term improvement in wealth or security 
\begin_inset Formula $(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The researcher can associate certain items to the respective groups for
 each of these functions (
\begin_inset Formula $A,\eta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) while the model's representative consumers ought to either attain higher
 wealth (income) through long-term assets or increase the felicity and the
 expectation of stable high-income through higher non-durable consumption.
 In an equilibrium, the consumers would stay at a quality consumption level
 just equivalent to the perceived probability of promotion - as the deterministi
c part of their long-term utility is provided by owned transferable assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model above is indeed a simplistic one since it treats a population
 with more focus on quality as the one participating in more conspicuous
 consumption.
 However, we must emphasise that the above approach relies on the notions
 of quality, need and assets - ideas that vary across geographies and require
 some subjective judgment.
 It would be hardly appropriate - for example - to consider sundry electrical
 items as assets in a developed economy.
 The ability of a market to differentiate items within a commodity also
 influences a particular view of model's long-term utility (more quality
 is on offer in some markets than others).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a model for a risky long-term utility, we can now return to comparing
 the rural and the urban consumers.
 It is possible that the rural consumer not having the refrigerator believes
 that she isn't far away from having one by enhancing her social network
 and obtaining higher ranking within her own locality.
 Urban life does not need to imply a necessarily better life-style but it
 does provide an increased possibility of access to industrial goods - such
 as electrical items.
 Further, if the consumer is amongst the poor in a rural area (lower ranking
 due to assets) and consumes less quality, then she may have little to lose
 by moving to the urban area - where the assets may be lower, but the perceived
 probabilities of transition are higher due to higher population and increased
 qualities (availability of new assets).
 There is an upfront cost to pay - possibly with a loss of assets or quality
 in other areas - but it isn't reflected in the differences in cost of assets
 alone.
 Instead, an increased perceived probability (quality) also has a role to
 play in the long-term utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, if it is possible to model the acquisition of assets over
 time, an intertemporal setting could further enhance our understanding
 of how quality of expenditure changes over time - allowing us to provide
 more robust insights on how long-term utility inclusive of status is indicated
 through consumption - which we view as a combination of quality in commodities
 and acquisition of long-term assets.
 To motivate a discrete model for consumer choice, we now provide a multinomial
 logit analysis of quality against assets owned.

 If the consumer doesn't decrease the quantities consumed

Problem Statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Research Question] The role of inequalities and status consumption is less
 understood.
 Instead of considering status consumption a wasteful consumption we use
 the importance of reference point that determine snob and bandwagon consumption.
 The model looks at how disposable income after having addressed basic needs
 may be spent in mechanisms that reward upside risk or mitigate downside
 risks to understand how a consumer's risk aversion might affect her future
 wealth - given exogenous mechanisms that both reward and mitigate risks.
 The basic question - how risk -aversion affects relative wealth.
 
\series bold
Can risk-averse consumer with lower budget gain by being more or less risk-avers
e than the other consumer?

[Advantages] We believe the subjective uncertainty and it's may provide
 a more general approach to in the developing countries where visible consumptio
n is more difficult to measure - given the varied social contexts of developing
 countries and extreme wealth differences.
 The difference in risk-seeking could be induced due to occupational structures
 and influence the equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Details and Side-Goals] As we ignoring the accumulation in the model, all
 consumption above needs is either risky gain or risky loss.
 If accumulation was permitted, the consumer ..
 security that be enhanced or mitigated with investments subject to a budget
 constraint, we could  consider the option of accumulation so that the consumer
 optimises her net wealth in the long-run.
 
\bar under
The role of taxes - which we see as additional cost of upside risk is briefly
 discussed in the context of reference point.
 
\bar default
In the intertemporal extension of the problem, we elaborate how consumer
 could spread risk across time i.e.
 become loss averse in the short-term but risk-seeking in the long-term.

[Source of Uncertainty] 
\bar under
There are forces in the economy that are driven by macroeconomic resources
 - but how these trends are exercised at finer levels are driven by competitions.
 While new resources are discovered - there distribution tends to involve
 competitions at various levels.
 It is probably sign the of a meritocratic society where individuals are
 rewarded based on their hard work this justifying competitions as means
 of distributions.
 Since competitions may be too punitive to those, there are also mechanisms
 to protect against too much risk taking.
 In developed markets, one would like to consider the safety net institutions
 explicitly which ensure the distribution of the resources is performed
 with a fairness.
 
\bar default
The safety nets - by definiton are those that don't require you to be pay
 - but we consider a general environment where the unconditional payment
 in the event of adversity is small or negligible.
 
\bar under
All safety nets eventually come at a cost - the only difference is that
 consumer pool resources towards such investments - forgoing relative profits
 for shared security.
 This is different from the upside risks that reward risk taking.
 
\bar default
We consider a general function 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 - this also allows the investments any safety nets or allow a safety.
 
\bar under
We don't consider how the money is paid and consider the function exogenous.

[What is a bandwagon in the model?] We have said that bandwagon is defined
 relative to a reference point.
 If the consumer takes upside risk from below the reference point, that
 should be bandwagon.
 Jumping on a band-wagon exhibits loss-aversion in the sense that a consumer
 perceives a loss if she doesn't have the bandwagon.
 Bandwagons don't provide a security sense - but are defined only due to
 a reference point.
 They carry as much risk as the snob items.

[Meaning of status] Status is implied in the expectation of wealth form
 this competition.
 What status means to an individual differs from what it may mean for the
 group of individuals seen at a higher level.
 That is to say, status has a necessary social context.
 A high-status in one localised context is not necessarily high-status in
 another.What's common across multiple contexts - societies, communities
 is the networth of the individual.
 Power, net-worth are valued in all societies and carry a weight that allows
 us to view it as the long-term expectation of wealth.
 In 
\begin_inset Formula $\{g_{i}\}_{i\in[1,m]}$
\end_inset

 groups with 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i\in[1,m]}$
\end_inset

 consumers in every group 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

, each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{m}n_{i}$
\end_inset

consumers may have a private view of status, but the notion of status associate
 with groups each group 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

tends to be associated with the net wealth the group has amassed.
 So while status at personal level might be subject to subjective uncertainties
 that may be characteristics of the group 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 they status at higher levels is only an indicator of the materila significance
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 At an individual level, the consumer optimises her expected wealth but
 at a group-level her net wealth is what determines her status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color gray
[Model with Status] This is why explore the effect of risk-aversion in amassing
 the wealth.
 In face of gains and losses, the consumer can amass a fortune over multiple
 trials of a lottery where she may either take an upside risk or seek protection
 from the downside risk.
 Upside risks are equivalent to a consumer seeking to achieve higher than
 her peer group that we represent in the lottery.
 The protection is seen as an insurance proportional to the premium put
 forth by the consumer - the insurance being paid out in an adverse event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color gray
[Reference Level] Other than the private risk-aversion, the optimisation
 of wealth depends on the reference level of the consumer.
 Among consumers with varied levels of wealth, what's snob behaviour for
 a consumer with a low reference point could be bandwagon for those with
 a slightly higher reference points.
 For example, a farmer who sends her children to college the first time
 in her past generations could be a snob behaviour relative to her peers
 but getting an international degree in sciences or business could be a
 bandwagon behaviour to those relatively privileged.
 The expected wealth is therefor optimised with respect to a reference point
 in the model.
 In fact whether something is bandwagon or snob could be entirely to do
 with snob and bandwagon.
 When one wants to be a snob - they must take more upside risk than others.
 When one follows a bandwagon, one is trying to reduce the certain loss
 of not having a particular return ( Imagine there is a bandwagon good in
 the market which the consumer can purchase - not having the bandwagon could
 give a certain loss in income).

Before we detail the model, we provide an example of a simple optimisation
 of the CRRA utility under uncertainty.
 The consumer would optimise with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 the expected utility or the expected 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 itself.
 Consider the dynamics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard

\color gray
For the optimisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 itself the consumer would observe want to optimise the expected 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\Delta)=p\times(-\nu+\sigma(\nu))+(1-p)\times(-\nu)=-\nu+p\sigma(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $E(W)=p$
\end_inset

 .
 When optimising a CRRA utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\frac{A^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 , the consumer must optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A+\Delta)=pu(A-\nu+\sigma(\nu))+(1-p)u(A-v)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A+\Delta)=p\frac{(A-\nu+\sigma(\nu))^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}+(1-p)\frac{(A-\nu)^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

.
 In this utility, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is the relative risk-aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{u''(A)A}{u'(A)}$
\end_inset

.

] The question we're interested is whether such an optimisation sufficiently
 represents a competition for relative wealth.
 Towards this goal, we consider two sources of ...
 What we're saying is that the returns process is exogenous (as in the gold
 mine which implies a hypergeometric distribution for returns from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 rises and falls).
 The only reason we assume a process for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is to assume no structure for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and relate it only with the system property e.g.
 a pool of resources subject competition - which is by definition lossy.
 This common process compared across the CRRA and CRWR methods allows us
 to compare the two models.
 The risk-seeking behaviour is expressible in CRRA model (a more risk-averse
 individual would choose a lower

 We can see how differences in

The first issue is that of reference point 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 Setting the reference point 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}-x_{2}$
\end_inset

 is as good as setting it as a constant since consumers don't change 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 One assumption we can use is that when 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}>x_{2}$
\end_inset

, the consumer think that the other consumer would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=x_{1}-x_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So if 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=1000\$$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=2000\$$
\end_inset

, then my reference point is one where the rich guy's uses extra income
 in all risk.
 Another option is to use the 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\Delta)$
\end_inset

 as the reference.
 What do the two consumers compare themselves with? We could also set the
 reference point to 0 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 are all exogenous anyways).
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 allows us to start worrying about the consumer's need to have a higher
 risk-aversion (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

) or a higher risk-seeking 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu)$
\end_inset

 than the other.

There needs to be a role of the reference point but to understand how nu
 x matter in the competition, consider how a consumer with a different 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}\ne x_{2}$
\end_inset

 would optimise the distance of final payoffs.
 Optimising the distance is key as it allows to poorer consumer to participate
 in the competition as well - otherwise all outcomes where the poorer consumer
 loses are equivalent.
 This also avoid discontinuities in the solution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 when when 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 is free to vary.
 Before we talk about the reference point in the value function, consider
 the case when the consumer optimises the distance in wealth itself rather
 than any utility.
 Thus given 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

, the consumer 1 would always maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(\nu_{1},x_{1}))-E(G(\nu_{2},x_{2}))$
\end_inset

 .
 Even when this value is negative it's preferable to have a less negative
 value.
 This equilibrium is conditioned on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 the behaviour of the other consumer.
 The first question that needs to be asked is whether the consumer optimises
 over all possible value of theoretical 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 that maximises 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(x_{1},\nu_{1}))-E(G(x_{2},\nu_{2}))$

Above implies a Nash equilibrium where the consumers choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(x_{1},\nu_{1}))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(x_{2},\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 are maximised.
 This is because if a consumer 1 chooses any 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}'$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\ne\nu_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(x_{1},\nu_{1}'))<E(G(x_{1},\nu_{1}^{*}))$
\end_inset

 and the consumer would have a suboptimal solution.
 This would not change much if a consumer was optimising a linear utility
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $u(G(x_{1},\nu_{1})-G(x_{2},\nu_{2}))=u(G(x_{1},\nu_{1}))-u(G(x_{2},\nu_{2}))$

 A more realistic scenario of relative wealth is its optimisation with respect
 to a common reference point.

The reference points in PT as well as the non-linearity in value function
 are an empirical concern.
 A normative approach to variability of stochastic reference points from
 Koszegi and Rabin considers the extent to which the consumers are acclimatised
 to the reference point relevant to their decision.
 Koszegi approach is similar in many ways to a disappointment aversion model.
 In the Koszegi-Rabin model, a consumer can be considered having acclimatised
 to her reference point - which would imply reference as the expected value
 of the payoff.
 Alternatively, a consumer may choose a reference point that is closer to
 the final decision allowing her not time to acclimatise - therefore choosing
 a reference point with as much uncertainty as the final decision.
 The former equilibria - where the consumers has time to acclimatise is
 called a CPE while the latter is called an unacclimatised personal equilibrium
 (UPE).
 In the latter case, varied reference points can result in varied UPEs out
 of which a preferred personal equilibrium (PPE) is considered optimal.
 In the context of relative wealth, the presence of status inference indicate
 that the consumers have enough time to observe the reference point.
 Also, as long as there is some notion of fairness in a society a consumer
 can compare herself to an 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 different from hers - particularly, since 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the only parameter that separates a the consumer's fate from her competitor'
s (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 are consumer preference that are not part of choice).
 If we assume that the consumers believe that the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are distributed with the same distribution then 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{1})=E(x_{2})=r$
\end_inset

 which is the appropriate reference point.
 This however is hardly the state of ones' income.
 We tend to be more despondent about the future states of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The other extreme is that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{1})=x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{2})=x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If that is the case, we would see no concerns of relative wealth either.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color darkgray
If there is sense in acclimatisation over a long-time, the non-linearity
 of uncertainty must vanish .
 Any perception of fairness should also mean that the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 should not matter towards the reference point.
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is similar to the a certainty equivalent of long-term expectations of gains
 from the lottery.
 Given an indirect utility 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x)$
\end_inset

 for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 we know that a risk-neutral knows her fate is determined with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 alone, reference points are essentially view independent of one's 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 - so 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{1})=\mu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{2})=\mu_{2}$
\end_inset

 is not the solution for reference points.
 If we're saying that reference points are a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\mu(x_{1},x_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 The two extremes being unrealistic, we're looking for how the reference
 itself is distributed given 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The CPE condition provides us a solution of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $I(r)=$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $E_{x}(E_{p}(G(x,\nu))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is the indirect utility for the consumer (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x)\equiv E_{p}(G(x,\nu^{*}))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu^{*}$
\end_inset

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{p}(G(x,\nu))$
\end_inset

 is maximised 
\begin_inset Formula $\nexists\nu|E_{p}(G(x,\nu))>E_{p}(G(x,\nu^{*}))$
\end_inset

 ) .
 In terms for the inverse for 
\begin_inset Formula $I(r)$
\end_inset

 and given a distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (over which expectation 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{x}(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is calculated), the reference point can be defined as the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color darkgray
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
r & =I^{-1}(E_{x}(E_{p}(G(x,\nu)))

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What matter to the consumer is whether 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is between 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 or if it's on the same side of (
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 it's either below 
\begin_inset Formula $min(x_{1},x_{2})$
\end_inset

 or above 
\begin_inset Formula $max(x_{1},x_{2})$
\end_inset

+\mathbbm{1}_{S(x-\nu)-\phi>r}w(1-p)\cdot(S(x-\nu)-\phi-r)-\mathbbm{1}_{S(x-\nu)-\phi<r}\lambda w(1-p)\upsilon(r-(S(x-\nu)-\phi))

For simpler notation let 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}\equiv w(p,\alpha_{1})$

\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}'\equiv w(1-p,\alpha_{1})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}\equiv w(p,\alpha_{2})$

\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}'\equiv w(1-p,\alpha_{2})$
\end_inset

 (notice that
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}+w_{1}'=1$
\end_inset

) , the expected utility to be optimised for consumer 1 is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
u(x_{1},\nu_{1})=\mathbbm{1}_{P(\nu_{1})>r}w_{1}\cdot(P(\nu_{1})+\chi-r)-\mathbbm{1}_{P(\nu_{1})<r}\lambda w_{1}\cdot(r-P(\nu_{1})-\chi)\\
+\mathbbm{1}_{S(x_{1}-\nu_{1})-\phi>r}w_{1}'\cdot(S(x_{1}-\nu_{1})-\phi-r)-\mathbbm{1}_{S(x_{1}-\nu_{1})-\phi<r}\lambda w_{1}'\cdot\upsilon(r-(S(x_{1}-\nu_{1})-\phi))

+\mathbbm{1}_{S(x_{2}-\nu_{2})-\phi>r}w_{2}'\cdot(S(x_{2}-\nu_{2})-\phi-r)-\mathbbm{1}_{S(x_{2}-\nu_{2})-\phi<r}\lambda w_{2}'\cdot\upsilon(r-(S(x_{2}-\nu_{2})-\phi))

If it's possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)>r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S(x-\nu)-\phi>r$
\end_inset

 for both the consumers, then the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is reduced.
 The maximisation of utility depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S(x-\nu)$
\end_inset

 as much as it depends on how consumers are positioned with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 We believe that while consumers may have their personal views of what provides
 them higher status (a view that is fully captured in the value of risk-aversion
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

), what matters towards long-term status is whether the consumers have higher
 wealth or not.
 We compare the status of the two consumers as the 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(x_{1},\nu_{1}^{*})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(x_{2},\nu_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r,$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(x_{1},\alpha_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{2},\alpha_{2})$
\end_inset

 are fixed for the consumer and the selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{1}^{*},\nu_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

 is driven by 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and the risk aversion levels 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Too much risk-aversion can be costly to a consumer if 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is stronger than 
\begin_inset Formula $S(x-\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, a strong 
\begin_inset Formula $S(x-\nu)$
\end_inset

 would mean that being risk-seeking could be costly to the consumer.
  Without loss of generality we can assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}<x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Risk-aversion levels and the position of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 (consider in particular when 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}<r<x_{2}$
\end_inset

 - also consider 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $r-x_{1}<x_{2}-r\Rightarrow r<\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}$
\end_inset

 ) crystallise the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 - creating conditions under which the differing risk-aversion levels social
 institutions could create traps of poverty despite the perceived notions
 of social mobility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color darkgray
As such we can have two types of equilibrium with the consumer 1 (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}<x_{2}$
\end_inset

) is more risk-seeking than the consumer 2 or consumer 1 is more risk-averse
 than consumer 2.
 The model allows us to look for conditions under which these could be necessita
ted.
 Notice that the consumer's utilities don't need to match - they only maximise
 their own utility - their ranks are matched by the final expected wealth
 that doesn't consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

[Box vs Competition in CRRA] There is no god that plays dice so we don't
 assume

 as such.
 Two primary properties of the uncertainty in the model are that i
\series bold
) the sources of uncertainty are multiple 
\series default
and ii) 
\series bold
consumers are myopic 
\series default
i.e.
 they are more uncertain about some sources than others.
 For example, we would prefer to be unsure about the economy than to be
 unsure about their job.
 In the box and competition view, the first source is due to finiteness
 of resources and the second due to uncertainty in the expectation - which
 is explicitly modeled with a competition.
 In the CRRA utility (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) a consumer participates in a status competition lottery so that an amount
 
\begin_inset Formula $aR$
\end_inset

 is awarded to her with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 The expected gain for her

 but we use this simplification for now).
 While it's true that quality is not a finite resource like gold - we are
 only modeling that some unknown amount is allocated using a competition.
 The CRRA utility would correspond to this amount.
 Status consumption is part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the CRRA formulation.
 A higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 would mean a higher size of the bet.
 The size of the bet and the payoff is indeed capped at 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 (we could use a logistic functions as continuous approximations) for the
 capped gain.
 Since the consumer is unsure about the the size of

, she would proceed with a fixed expectation.
 Instead of long-term vs short-term the consumer has risk and security in
 the model.

\begin_layout Standard
[But how does 
\begin_inset Formula $psi$
\end_inset

 control the return?] The consumer may be worried that she has take too
 much risk and could balance it with buying a security.
 How is this certainty amount or insurance amount allocated - we could think
 of a mechanism where in every player puts up an amount psi which would
 be given to the losers in lottery.
 Let's say there are 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 players they participate in a lottery of size 
\begin_inset Formula $nu$
\end_inset

 so that the winner gets 
\begin_inset Formula $aR$
\end_inset

.
 If allocation to lotteries is fixed only a fixed amount is available to
 the consumers to play (or is exogenous).
 One can increase the bet size until the total reaches the amount 
\begin_inset Formula $aR$
\end_inset

 just the way someone increase security with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 But what are the losers losing except getting nothing? We could make sure
 that certain costs are taken from everyone who doesn't pay towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - otherwise there are no losers in the sense that that are two symmetric
 distribution of the income.
 One way is to use fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu}{\nu+\psi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\psi}{\nu+\psi}$
\end_inset

.
 
\series bold
We still don't know what's the losing bit.
 
\series default
We do know however that increasing 
\backslash
nu does not scale up wealth infinitely - however using 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu_{1}}{\nu_{1}+\nu_{2}}$
\end_inset

 does seem to raise infinitely.
 The fraction approach assumes that 
\series bold
relative advantage is linearly distributed
\series default
.
 The key problem is whether increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 would increase likelihood of winning or merely increase the payoff.
 This is a question of how the lottery is structured - and we need to think
 about what is closer to reality.
 While it is true for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 as investment the requirements for it change for status competitions across
 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-level, the factors influencing competitions are every 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-level are so different that one cannot assume the same 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Varying 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 across 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with a common likelihood 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 therefore does not make sense.
 Going back to the box and distribution of the amount 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, the only option to distribute 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is to reward those who show higher potential to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 otherwise there would no point of the distribution (those who get more
 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 themselves would get more than what we can allocate them).
 Now we have two options 1.
 have a zero position natural process or a 2.
 carry over natural process..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[myopia and status] It is the latter uncertainty in the reference points
 - that results in the consumer being myopic with respect to the investment
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 
\series bold
Status is a problem of 
\series default
intertemporal substitution as long as status consumption is a risky choice.
 Consumers would delay consumption to fulfill their needs and add more to
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 if they can - but if they are optimising status ( seen not the result of
 an additional visible bit - but the response with respect to a reference)
 then they would take on more risk.
