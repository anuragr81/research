Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models for demand analysis rely on exogenous price observations for the
 consumer's basket.
 The prices observed in the market embody both i) how the market, subject
 to supply pressures, addresses the needs of the consumers and ii) how it
 prices the differences in quality variants of the same commodity to the
 consumer.
 Despite market-observed prices being of a central importance to the demand
 analysis, it is only recently that the detailed prices observed in the
 market are made available in micro-data surveys.
 Arguing that market prices are key to an understanding of quality, we enhance
 a typical demand analysis to include the quality variation within commodities,
 the needs faced by the consumer and other household characteristics such
 as income and social-economic standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
To understand the choice the consumers face in a market when faced with
 rising prices, incomes and urban development, we focus on food quality.
 The prices are important for this analysis.
 The motivation for these is quite simple i) poor countries have most people
 on subsistence - the chance of moving up in society is little ii) the market
 has changed the prices have improved.
 Thus the consumers face choices determined by the markets developments
 in the area - the demand is thus likely to be segmented.
 THis is worth exploring as we explain with a model for quality and long-term
 standing- which is our way to understand CC.
 We explain needs and quality, and look for substitution for consumers.
 
\bar default
In the analysis that follows, the needs of the consumers are proxied by
 the number of members (age-adjusted) in the household (and other available
 scales) while quality is measured as the portion of budget spent on high
 vs low-price items.
 With the AIDS formulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DeatonMuellbauerAIDS"

\end_inset

 for this model of quality, the scale of consumer needs appears as a control
 variable in the AIDS budget share equations whereas the quality-choices
 appear as dependent variables in the equations (along with the budget shares
 for every commodity).
 This is the so-called

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consumer can improve quality in food or in other commodity groups as her
 income rises.
 The improvement and sustenance of quality across multiple commodity groups
 is relevant from a status-consumption perspective - since consumers of
 high-quality in all groups are more likely to carry status than those who
 don't.
 This is more important in the context of developing countries where differences
 in quality are wider in the consumer population.
 One thus needs to distinguish between the consumption of quality and what
 is termed as conspicuous consumption.
 At least semantically speaking, the term conspicuous consumption encompasses
 only the exclusive consumption by the rich.
 We do note that there are similarities between the current developments
 in Africa and the rapid economic developments in the United States of the
 late 19th century - in view of the transition of their respective economies
 from a vastly agrarian society to an industrialised one.
 However, we also take issue with extending the concepts identified by Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

 into the developing markets without a consideration for income and social
 inequalities.
 Firstly, in the environment of nascent economic growth which we observe
 in the sub-Saharan Africa, the options for conspicuous consumption are
 still limited to a very small part of the population.
 Secondly, due to the social fragmentation within the sub-Saharan Africa
 (see the historical note in the Appendix I), the social context which the
 market forces operate within are not the same as that of North America
 in its gilded age.
 We believe that quality in consumption and possession of long-term assets
 - being a concern for a much larger section of the population - may provide
 a better picture of the status-related consumption than a focus on visible
 items in the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our focus on quality is also motivated by a need to reduce subjective judgments
 from the classification of visible items.
 Status - which motivates conspicuous consumption - is a complex social
 psychological phenomenon and thus one cannot rule out a subjective judgment
 in deciding whether an item is a status good or not.
 For example, if one were to rely only on whether an item can be afforded
 by the rich - then electricity, being used by a small and rich part of
 the population in a sub-Saharan African country like Tanzania, may appear
 to be a status good - at par with weddings (which are a clearer way of
 indicating status).
 But whether the same amount of money spent on weddings enhances status
 more than when it's spent on electricity is a far more difficult question
 to answer.
 Similarly, one could argue that buying clothes indicates higher status
 and record consumption on clothes as conspicuous consumption.
 But without observing the effect that getting electricity in the house
 or moving to a bigger house may have on a consumer's long-term utility
 and the perceived status, we cannot assume a significant status-benefit
 to the consumer from expenditure on clothing - since the possibility that
 those spending on recently installed electricity or a newly built house
 may actually be cutting down on clothing expenditure while deriving status
 from electricity or house ownership cannot be ruled out.
 To solve these fundamental issues, the literature on conspicuous consumption
 has often proceeded with a snapshot consumer poll that obtains the appropriate
 classification directly from the consumer.
 However, drawing inferences on long-term consumer behaviour from such analyses
 still remains a challenge due to the cross-sectional nature of such surveys.
 Further, status goods are indeed hardly static - as the demand for newly
 introduced items - e.g.
 a smart-phone or a TV - changes quickly.
 The types of status items one may wish to model (e.g.
 snob / bandwagon depending on whether the consumer wants to separate herself
 from others with the item or places herself) are subject to change as the
 consumer incomes increase over time and the markets evolve to address consumer
 needs by launching cheaper substitutes etc..
 It is to provide a dynamic model which encapsulates such types that we
 view status as part of the consumer's long term utility - and attempt to
 explain it using the concepts from the literature on quality.
 Such a model would also allow us to refine the concepts of conspicuous
 consumption that may be used to compare the consumer behaviour in both
 developing and developed markets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If status can be seen as part of the consumer's long-term expected utility,
 it follows that the status that a consumer derives from consumption must
 come out of either elite non-durable consumption or the long-term socio-economi
c stnading.
 Thus, tracking quality over time (i.e.
 high-quality consumption) against the socio-economic standing including
 asset ownership can help us understand the demand for status.
 Instead of attempting to find the criteria for separating status-items
 from bare-necessities, we view status consumption as the consumer's short-term
 needs (i.e.
 quality or expensive non-durable consumption ENDC) as opposed to her long-term
 needs that are fulfilled with the longer term socio-economic standing (e.g.
 with skills, occupation, family wealth etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The econometric methods we suggest are meant to achieve two goals.
 First is to explain the differences in quality across the population -
 given a certain household characteristics.
 The second is to incorporate the discrete choices that a consumer faces
 for sparsely available or costlier items (such as electricity in Tanzania
 or urban housing).
 In the current chapter, we attempt to address only the former by enhancing
 the AIDS formulation.
 The latter goal - which can be seen as an instance of intertemporal substitutio
n between improving quality and acquiring costlier long-term status - is
 to be addressed in a subsequent chapter.
 We believe that the econometric methods developed in the current chapter
 are generic enough to be applied to surveys from other economies.
 More generally, the reason why we set ourselves to explain long-standing
 inequalities or regional disparities in terms of gaps in incomes, available
 quality and asset ownership is to be able to translate the wide-ranging
 social observations on conspicuous consumption in the literature onto empirical
 measurements that may work under disparate social contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AIDS methods used in the current chapter take quality and socio-economic
 standing as inputs.
 For the measurement of quality, we take a price-based view.
 As quality is priced in the market, the quality for a commodity is indicated
 by the prices of the variants of a commodity.
 In the Tanzanian data which we have used, therefore, eggs and milk would
 be deemed of lower quality than goat and beef for proteins.
 Similarly for transport, bicycle would be of lower quality than car and
 so on.

 carrying forward the notion of equivalence scales used by Houthakker.
 In the simple repackaging method, with the quality for a (composite) good
 parametrised as 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and its base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$

\begin_layout Standard
The base-price is chosen so that one can view the demand for items with

 and

 in terms of the base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and the quality parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\{b_{1},b_{2},...\}$
\end_inset

).
 Here, an implicit assumption is that the variants in every category are
 perfect substitutes.
 With that assumption, setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 to be the quality indicator and 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\theta)$
\end_inset

 a function of the quality parameter, one can write the following in terms
 of a cost function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\tilde{c}(u,p_{1},p_{2},...,\theta) & =c(u,\frac{p_{1}}{h(\theta)},p_{2},...,1)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the idea of simple repackaging requires perfect substitution, its applicabili
ty to all commodity groups is somewhat limited.
 Consider for example, a consumer switching from kerosene usage to electricity
 usage - which is far more than an improvement of quality in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and makes the expression of electricity consumption in terms of the quantity
 and price of kerosene consumed somewhat of a stretch.
 To proceed, one may consider how using electricity would change the utility
 for food (with refrigerator), household consumption (hair-dryers) etc..
 The classical approach taken by Fisher and Shell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 recommends adjusting the prices of the final goods i.e.
 by decomposing utilities in a way that quality-change can be traced to
 all composite goods whose quality is affected by the particular commodity
 (e.g.
 electricity).
 This may sound rather cumbersome, but the issue can in fact be mitigated
 if there were a recursive tree-like hierarchy of the items such as refrigerator
s that improve the quality of other goods.
 With a tree-like structure, one needs to only look at the nodes of the
 trees i.e.
 adjust the price of all food items whose quality is improved.
 In addition to adjusting the price for energy, therefore one would also
 adjust the price for food.
 It is indeed possible to write separable utility functions for all such
 node items whose quality is enhanced.
 It is clear, however, that price-adjustment for electricity would need
 to go beyond the energy-commodity-group.
 Further, a detailed historical price information for all commodities in
 the context whose quality is changed due electricity for such a tree-structure
 to be set up would be required for an empirical analysis
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that we are concerned with the change in quality - rather than change
 in taste in the current study.
 Another way of stating this assumption is that all changes in tastes that
 are relevant to our study must arise out of a change in quality in one
 of the commodities.

While theoretical methods for demand have been refined over time, the empirical
 issue of unavailability of market prices (and thereby of quality) has probably
 not received the attention it deserves 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 A methodology commonly used in demand studies for its robustness and simplicity
 is the AIDS model (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonMuellbauerAIDS"

\end_inset

) - which we adapt for quality purpose (see McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

).
 Based on PIGL approaches originally popularised by Barten
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, Gorman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "GormanPreference"

\end_inset

 and Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerAggConsum"

\end_inset

, the method is simple to implement and yet readily conforms to the demand
 function restrictions.
 Still, AIDS implementations - like any other - are often ailed by the lack
 of observed market prices.
 An approach used quite often in empirical studies is to stick the implicit
 price-deflator (or unit-values) as prices in the AIDS regressions (see
 Tafere et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"

\end_inset

 for a recent implementation).
 While this may be the best way to proceed when market prices are not observed,
 their use can result in a severe measurement error since the quantities
 consumed by the consumer appear both in the dependent variable (as budget
 share's numerator) of the AIDS equations (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

) and in their control variables (as the denominator for unit-value used
 as price).
 Since observing market prices prevents such measurements errors (see the
 discussion by McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

 and Gibson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonKimQualityBog2019"

\end_inset

), we prefer their use for measuring the consumption of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of market prices in consumer surveys hardly makes the AIDS methodology
 less usable - just that the correction of such measurement errors is not
 always trivial (see Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities"

\end_inset

 for one such approach and McKelvey's assessment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

 of the Deaton method).
 AIDS method can be readily extended to other panel data scenarios.
 For example, the demographic variables in the AIDS model can be accommodated
 with the so-called demographic translation where the intercept 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\alpha_{i}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_{ij}ln(p_{jh})+\beta_{i}ln(\frac{x_{h}}{P})$
\end_inset

 is expanded as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\alpha_{i} & =\rho_{io}+\sum_{k=1}^{s}\rho_{ik}d_{k}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,n]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{k}$
\end_inset

 are the demographic variables (see Pollack and Wales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PollockWalesDemand"

\end_inset

).
 Similarly, the structural changes in the parameters over time is addressed
 with a dynamic AIDS formulation that is often based on differencing the
 budget shares over the time-periods (see Anderson and Blundell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersonBlundellAIDSTest1983,AndersonBlundellDynEqn1982"

\end_inset

 adjust AIDS to account for cases when there is no consumption on certain
 items - by incorporating an inverse Mills ratio into the AIDS regressions.
 This approach is particularly relevant for the analysis of quality since
 the consumption on high quality goods is often 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truncated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a significant part of the population.
 This approach performs a first-stage probit where the dependent variable
 is an indicator variable - denoting whether the household

 consumes the item 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (given 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 Unfortunately, they are compelled to use the unit-values instead of (unavailabl

Separability and Quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a discussion of conspicuous items in empirical studies, separability
 is often implicitly assumed.
 The groups are assumed separable often on the grounds of functionality
 - and are thus essentially a structure imposed on consumer demand by the
 researcher.
 In the context of status consumption, it would seem that these wide functional
 groups are not as pertinent for understanding the consumption of
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conspicuous
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items - whose demand elasticities are often estimated in the literature
 with a collection of visible/conspicuous items as if they were a separate
 commodity group themselves.
 The literature often justifies the use of a separate group of conspicuous
 items with an additional assumption that conspicuous consumption has a
 zero-utility in the usual (Veblen) sense.
 Therefore, the demand for these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items has to also be separable.
 Working with consumption diary microdata, on the other hand, we find this
 assumption (henceforth referred to as the futility assumption) somewhat
 limiting.
 This is simply because in the real-world, a high-quality item (priced higher
 in the market than its substitutes) is conspicuous not solely on grounds
 of its visibility.
 Because of how widespread the low-quality consumption may be, an item that
 is not so important from a visibility perspective (i.e.
 is futile in the usual sense) may still remain relevant for status - which
 we see as a part of the consumer's long-term utility.
 More so in the developing world context - where both the poverty levels
 and inequality are very high - conspicuous consumption need not be futile
 in the usual sense at all.

 item.

.
 Given a set of functional groups, we view the segmentation of quality in
 the population and the factors affecting such a segmentation - as drivers
 of status.
 Thus we do not rely on analysis of visible items whose demand needs to
 be considered a weakly separable group by themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we don't use the futility assumption, the issue of separability requires
 particular attention for any status-related interpretations.
 The (weakly) separable groups being based on a rather strict criteria (function
al), the high quality items within the groups are not meant to be interchangeabl
e with each other as such.
 However, if status is derived from items, then either they exist as separable
 groups (which is the tractable option but is not plausible in our view)
 or they do not (in which case an aggregation for them is not possible).
 For the representative consumer in the model we choose, we keep the commodity
 groups weakly separable - but allow the consumer to prefer higher quality
 in one group over that in the other.
 As the consumer maintains different qualities within each group, it is
 possible to talk about quality-substitution amongst high-quality items
 in a sense (even though the claims for separability of high-quality are
 improper - as we later explain with a rejection of the two-state approach).
 More particularly, as the representative consumer expands her needs and
 increases her income, she may switch on expenditure on high quality from
 one commodity group to another.
 Equivalently two consumers - 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
- may acquire habits of higher quality consumption in different categories.
 To explain this with an example, consider that even though kobe beef cannot
 be substituted with a luxury travel as such (being in separable commodity
 groups), a high standard of life can be indicated by either or both of
 them and the consumer may make any of the possible choices.
 This approach gauges how consumers put some weight on higher-quality within
 each commodity group ( i.e.
 the portion of total expenditure spent on the expensive non-durable consumption
) based on their tastes (which in turn depend on their personal characteristics)
 and the market prices of higher quality items in every category.
 We make no attempts to see how overall quality is budgeted for by the consumer.
 In other words, no attempts are made to understand how consumers may purchase
 a desired amount of (overall) quality.
 As we would later explain, this also means that a two-state budgeting model
 cannot be used for quality analysis.
 We limit our to seeing how high-quality consumption varies and could be
 segmented across a population.
 In the context of the developing economies, we argue that such a segmentation
 is relevant for status-related consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use quality within the separable groups to interpret how consumption
 in a group could be of any signaling value.
 When most people don't have electricity therefore, having electricity as
 opposed to kerosene does provide a status benefit.
 Similarly, when most people take public-transport to work, having a car
 also provides a status benefit and so on.
 No distinction of private vs public/visible consumption is necessary from
 this point of view.

\begin_layout Standard
As we don't attempt to aggregate high-quality items from across commodity
 groups, a two-state budgeting approach (commonly used in the literature
 on household demand) can be conveniently discarded.
 Recall that the two-state budgeting represents a hierarchy of separable
 goods.
 If the futility argument were valid for high-quality products, one could
 have aggregated quality consumed in different commodity groups into an
 overall quality metric.
 Without the futility argument, on the other hand, such an aggregation is
 improper.
 This is because a key condition for the tree-like structure of a two-state
 budgeting model is that the relative demand between two items in any two
 different categories changes only in response to the total expenditure
 (i.e response to price changes and total expenditure changes must use the
 same channels of communication in the commodity tree
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer,StrotzUtilityTree1957"

\end_inset

).
 Evidently, this is impossible to guarantee if we claim that quality can
 be substituted from across the commodity groups i.e.
 if consumers may be indifferent to choosing quality in one category to
 that in another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the issue with aggregating quality from across commodity groups
 in a two-state budgeting model with an example, consider a two-group world
 of food and energy - within which we have items : beef-bread-milk and electrici
ty-kerosene-charcoal respectively.
 If consumers don't cut back on quality in one group to gain quality in
 another, the items - food and energy - can be assumed (and tested empirically)
 to be separable groups - since it is plausible for a consumer to allocate
 some money 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy respectively in the first-stage (based on her knowledge
 of the price-indices for food and energy).
 Once the expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 are fixed, the (representative) consumer can subsequently decide in the
 second-state how much of kerosene or electricity to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and how much beef or bread to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Individual prices of every item within the category would decide which
 food varieties and which energy sources are to be purchased.
 Under the conditions of weak separability, it is implied that cheaper bread
 (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose
 a more expensive fuel (price-sensitivity for electricity, charcoal etc.
 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

 for details on the theory).
 This condition - however - falls apart if we introduce the substitution
 for quality across the commodity groups.
 More particularly, if we assume that a consumer gets quality utility from
 using electricity and from eating beef interchangeably, then having decided
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 does not guarantee that she would not switch to more consumption on electricity
 if kobe beef becomes cheaper.
 This is because overall quality - due to our assumption - is aggregated
 from across the commodity groups.
 Thus unlike in the case of energy and food without quality substitution
 across commodity-groups, cheaper food can be compensated with the switch
 to electricity.
 If we have set ourselves to test the presence of such a substitution across
 commodity groups, we cannot assume that it simply doesn't exist.
 Since price sensitivities and total expenditure sensitivities don't follow
 the same channel of communication in the two-state budgeting tree, the
 necessary condition for two-stage separability is not met (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

).
 Thus even though a tree-structure could present a relevant view of the
 hierarchy of commodity groups, we cannot accept the model due to the weak
 separable condition on overall quality.

Before we explain the desired properties of the quality-metric let's establish

\begin_layout Standard
With the assumption that a consumer observes the price index of a commodity
 (rather than individual prices), an econometric method based on the above
 indirect utility can be employed for a set of commodity groups with items
 within.
 However, since a better quality item is set to be more expensive than the
 less quality item, a switch to higher quality by the consumer is inseparable
 from an increase in the price-index of the commodity (whose multiple variants
 are observed).
 The increase in the price-index of an item (regardless of whether it's
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shift -so that the relative price structure of the variants remains the
 same or not) is going to be always interpreted as the consumer reducing
 the quantity consumed of the item.
 Indeed it may still be possible to use the model as long as one assumes
 that the individual's quality preferences are fixed, but change in quality
 as a response to price cannot be studied with the model as such.
 An explicit measure of quality is therefore necessary in the direct utility
 (or equivalently in the cost-function) for us to interpret meaningful results
 for quality using the corresponding econometric method

One of such approaches is to view the demand for a high-quality item as
 more of the low-cost item.
 This so called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

simple-repackaging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approach strives to obtain an adjustment factor for the demand based on
 the consumption on items (see Griliches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GrilichesIndex1971"

\end_inset

 for the theoretical underpinnings with the approach and for an account
 of measurement of quality change).
 Since a perfect substitution is assumed in the simple-repackaging method,
 we view quality as a separate commodity only for the commodity groups where
 substitution can exist between the high-quality and low-quality items (see
 Houthakker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "HouthakkerFamilySurvey"

\end_inset

 and Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

 for an example).
 Here, the quantities consumed for two (or more) items within a commodity
 (e.g.
 tea and carbonated drinks under beverages that can be interchanged by the
 consumer) are viewed as an aggregate-quantity of a composite good (i.e.
 beverages) along with the value consumed of a quality metric (proportion
 of tea and carbonated drinks).
 In other words, the quantity-price tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1},p_{1}),(q_{2},p_{2})...$
\end_inset

 within a commodity could be expressed as a quantity and quality pair -
 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q_{G},P_{G}),(\nu_{G},p_{\nu_{G}})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G},Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 are prices and quantity consumed for a composite commodity while 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{G}$
\end_inset

 represents the quality of the commodity - treated as a separate good.
 The quantity and quality pair of goods correspond to the real quantities
 consumed for several items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows that in the above aggregation, the price of quality (along with
 the quality metric) should also appear in the model for consumer choice.
 Further, the demand must also follow the Hick's commodity theorem.
 This is possible when the relative price structure of the variants of a
 commodity can be assumed constant.
 With a constant relative price structure , the price of quality can be
 interpreted in terms of a composite price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the commodity aggregate 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 represents the expenditure on group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, then using a constant relative price-structure allows us to write the
 demand function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(E_{G},p_{G})$
\end_inset

 as :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

Thus even though we treat quality as a separate commodity, the constant-relative

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One way to establish this equivalence is to interpret the quality in the
 market as the gradient of price of preferred items (sorted by price or
 otherwise) - an approach that is more akin to an aggregation problem.
 Consider for example that with energy, such a gradient would be calculated
 with the price one has to pay to get more of electricity.
 Similarly, for food, this would be the price one has to pay to get more
 of meat etc.
 The formulation effectively relies on the consumed basket aggregate - and
 is thus equivalent to the composite aggregated method (which in turn relies
 on a composite aggregate price).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This is because our notion of quality is price-based and the quality metric
 we choose is based on a constant relative price structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tastes, prices and needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the prices of items, which we model as a relative price structure
 and a base price (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

), the quality demanded by the representative consumer in the model is sensitive
 to needs of the consumer and her household characteristics.
 Here, what is implied by needs are the means of subsistence that are standardis
ed to be the same for a wealthy and a destitute household.
 No qualitative distinction is drawn - for example - between the status
 needs of a rich and a poor family (through their disparate educational
 needs etc.).
 The notion of status in the model comes only from the quality and household
 characteristics that are associated with the common need for the rich and
 poor households - who all are meant to maintain high quality as possible
 across all categories.
 In other words, the quality and security associated with these common needs
 are better afforded with higher income (or other relevant household characteris
tics).
 The first assumption that helps parametrise factors affecting quality is
 therefore that the essential needs of the family unit (member) are the
 same for all consumers.
 The second assumption which makes the consumer utility a non-decreasing
 function of this desired quality metric - is that all consumers hope to
 increase either their net asset worth (long-term standing) or quality (ENDC)
 at all times.
 These assumptions allow us to write the direct utility for the consumer
 as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
u & =\upsilon(\eta,\nu,\rho)\label{eq:utility}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 represents the needs of the family (a scaled number of family members),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is the quality consumed and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are the household characteristics that are held for the long-term.
 Contrasting this with the standard direct utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\upsilon(q)$
\end_inset

, we essentially view 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta,\nu$
\end_inset

 and include 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the direct utility only to model the segmentation of the long-term prevailin
g conditions under which quality(
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) and needs (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

) are availed by the consumer.
 Ignoring the price changes for a moment, consider how a consumer might
 address her essential needs and improve quality at the same time.
 In the environment of stable prices, it follows that the distribution of
 ENDC weights - which the quality metric measures - would be different for
 an asset-owning consumer who spends on upkeep and maintenance costs for
 assets she possess from a consumer who has given up on hopes of acquiring
 assets or addresses other essential needs (differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 Quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 essentially competes with the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 of the consumer and due to the very definition of quality, the consumer
 cannot sacrifice needs in order to purchase quality.
 Thus, when prices are stable, a rise in ENDC (quality) must come either
 from an increase in income or from change in owned assets (socio-economic
 standing - 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

).
 Likewise, a drop in quality must be due to change in owned assets (socio-econom
ic standing which we assess with a vector of occupation, education, region/local
ity/neighborhood/assets- 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) or addressing of more urgent needs (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,\eta$
\end_inset

 are likely to be fixed in the short-run, let us now consider the effect
 of price changes.
 Here, the fact that quality in one group may be preferred to quality in
 another becomes relevant (hence the use of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 As we have discussed before, quality across commodity groups may not be
 aggregated into an overall quality metric but a consumer could prefer quality
 in one commodity (e.g.
 transport) to another (food or vice versa) - driven by the change in prices,
 and her long-term standing (household characteristics, ownership of long-term
 durable good or needs).
 To illustrate this with an example, consider a middle-income family that
 has to cut down on expenses (due to loss of income or otherwise) by moving
 to a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants
 are fewer.
 The consumption on expensive dining or similar options - which signaled
 status and improved self-image - may no longer be possible for the family.
 Hence, the consumption might either shift to purchasing an improved asset
 or improve quality in some other category (e.g.
 better jewelry, better schooling for children) - assuming that the needs
 of the family (indicated by the number of family members) haven't changed.
 Notice how the difference between basic needs and status-needs is not a
 concern for the model - which only observes the differences between high-price
 and low-price consumption in the same group - assuming that the essential
 needs are independent of the wealth of the consumer (an important condition
 for Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:utility"

\end_inset

).
 All non-essential needs are therefore interpreted in terms of quality (ENDC)
 and the socio-economic standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although it is possible that both non-durable and durable goods within a
 single commodity group contribute to status for the consumer, the real-world
 often presents a simpler context where either durable or non-durable consumptio
n dominates in a given commodity group.
 Recall that an elementary commodity is one where no quality variation is
 supposed to exist and higher quality can be achieved only through more
 purchase of the commodity.
 A composite commodity - on other hand - is a commodity where a sufficient
 quality variation exists and a consumer can use a mix of higher quality
 and lower-quality goods within the commodity.
 We assume that a commodity group is either dominated by long-term asset
 or it isn't so that there are only two ways a consumer can spend on quality
 - either by switching between the variants of a composite commodity (choosing
 higher or lower quality of a composite commodity where long-term assets
 do not exist) or spending more on an elementary commodity (where long-term
 assets dominate and quality variation doesn't exist).
 The empirical implications of this assumption are not serious.
 In the Tanzanian data for example, the quality variation is immaterial
 for non-durable consumption in transport and household categories and no
 assets are meant to exist for food and energy categories given the non-durable
 nature of their consumption.
 The implication of the above assumption is only that both elementary consumptio
n and composite commodity consumption - compete for the consumer's money.

A desired property of the price-based metric we seek is that it should be

 Such a metric would thus allow us to argue for a preference order over

 on (or raises) quality as her income drops (or rises).
 One such metric is simply the relative-price-weighted sum of expenditure

\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}=q_{G}$
\end_inset

 only if quality effects are absent since 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}=q_{G}\Rightarrow\frac{E_{G}}{P_{G}}=\frac{E_{G}}{V_{G}}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow P_{G}=V_{G}=P_{G}\nu_{G}$
\end_inset

 (unit quantity is interpreted as 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}=\frac{E_{G}}{q_{G}}$
\end_inset

 ).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A quality-adjusted quantity is a more appropriate formulation for this
 purpose.
 Since quality is to be priced in the market, we can consider this price-structu
red weighted quantity as the quality-adjusted quantity and express the pair
\begin_inset Formula $\{(20,1.5).(10,2)\}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,4(=2\times1.5+1\times2))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.6=\frac{4}{1.5+2})$
\end_inset

 .
  In a certain way, the price of composite quality can be viewed as exactly
 zero since the total expenditure is already accounted for in the composite
 good's consumption i.e.
 10
\begin_inset Formula $\times4=40$
\end_inset

.
 If the quantities consumed were slightly different for another consumer
 e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(20,0.5),(10,3)\}$
\end_inset

 then too 
\begin_inset Formula $(E=40)$
\end_inset

 and we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,4(=2\times0.5+1\times3))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.14=\frac{4}{3.5})$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to see that the quality is lower for the latter case even though
 the physical quantity is the same.
 The quality adjusted quantity accounts for the total expenditure and as
 such there is no price needed for the quality value calculated in the above
 fashion.
 Even though quality is treated as a separate good, the use of a quality-adjuste
d quantity instead of the physical quantity gives us a clearer view of the
 composite price of the commodity

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above quality metric allows us to estimate price derivatives of quality
 with an econometric model.
 The needs of the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

- which we estimate with an age-adjusted number of family members - can
 be treated as the intercept in the budget share regressions used in econometric
 methods.
 Notice that if one includes the assets ownership indicator variables (
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 if owned 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 otherwise) - which can be viewed associated with different commodity groups
 - in the intercept, two issues may need to be handled.
 The first issue is that there may be differences in quality within the
 several long-term assets themselves that would be ignored in the indicator
 variables for ownership.
 The second issue is that of the separability of demand with respect to
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 More specifically, if the assets owned by the consumer are classified into
 distinct functional groups, then it needs to be specified whether ownership
 in one category influences consumer preference for quality in another -
 depending on which one may use different dummy variables corresponding
 to the respective assets ownership in every separable commodity group (whose
 budget share equation is used).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the issues can be resolved by using the total cost (logarithm) of the
 asset ownership rather than the indicator variables of their ownership.
 The quality difference for assets are thus easily incorporated in the model
 with the use of costs.
 Since we treat 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 as constant in the near-term, the second issue can be resolved if we consider
 the total assets cost and allow the assets in a commodity group 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{1}$
\end_inset

 (which are part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho)$
\end_inset

 to influence the high quality consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{G_{2}}$
\end_inset

 in another group 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 The same asset ownership cost-related variables are thus used as intercept
 in equations corresponding to every commodity group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now discuss the limitations of the model and caveats for its interpretations.
 The first caveat is that the quality metric described above rests upon
 the rather stringent condition of aggregation with a constant relative
 price structure (i.e.
 the Hicks aggregation commodity theorem).
 This is the reason why our classification of items into commodity groups
 is driven by the price-structure.
 Secondly, the quality within a commodity group can be aggregated only as
 long as the goods that the group comprises of can be ordered based on a
 certain criteria - an order that is the judgment of the researcher - not
 the consumer (see Nelson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 for this clarification).
 Taking example of the meat commodity group, there is no reason to think
 that goat is of higher quality than beef if the former is only slightly
 costlier.
 However, quality differences are more plausible if the price differences
 are larger - e.g.
 with the choice of pulses over chicken under the protein category.
 The judgment of quality is thus provided by the researcher at an appropriate
 level of granularity - a justification that is a prerequisite for any quantity
 aggregation to make sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the obvious limitations to the universality of such an aggregation
 criterion, the utility of the above metric in understanding consumption
 of quality is restricted by the very aggregated view that makes it desirable
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice also that one cannot talk about the quality metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{G}$
\end_inset

 defined above unless the quantity of consumption is observed in data.
 This is often the case for food, but not necessarily for other goods.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We illustrate this with a comparison of item-wise and aggregated approaches.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, any approach that views a higher quality product in terms of
 a lower quality product is problematic when the items vary widely.
 As an example, the demand of a better good in a commodity group as a multiple
 of the worse good may be plausible for meat/food - but considering electricity
 in terms of coal into one aggregate is far less plausible (see the discussion
 on consumer indices in Fisher-Shell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 on how this issue could be remedied).
 At the consumer's level, the substitution between kerosene and electricity
 is not as straightforward as amongst the quality variants of protein.
 A continuous measure of quality does make sense in a setting where a mixture
 of high and low quality items are consumed (see Houthakker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerFamilySurvey"

\end_inset

 for an example) - but it fails to account for quality difference when choices
 vary widely.
 We use indicator variables in groups (such as electricity) where a continuous
 measure does makes less sense.
 However, a discrete view of quality differences may be more appropriate
 for non-food categories (e.g.
 transport - which is the subject of a seminal work on discrete choice by
 Domencic-McFadden
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McFaddenDomencic1975"

\end_inset

) where the consumers either consume a certain quantity of an item or they
 don't at all (more so in the developing countries where income inequalities
 are starker).
 In the current chapter, we provide a selection approach to interpret demand
 for such items and use indicator variables for items that are not substitutable
 with other items in a category.
 The modeling of discrete choice may prove to be a better approach to explaining
 the choices that consumers face for non-food commodities - particularly
 if the change in asset ownership over time is also incorporated in such
 a model.
 These discrete utility models are the subject of a subsequent chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current chapter, we use the data on possession of assets in the Tanzanian
 consumption microdata to seek differences in the quality habits in the
 different asset ownership bands (and other characteristics).
 For consumption of quality, the commodity groups: food, energy, household
 and transport are identified.
 Here, food is the only group where we quantity consumed is recorded.
 Thus the quality of protein, carbohydrates, beverages etc.
 - each of which is treated as a composite good - is easy to determine with
 the metric presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Econometric-model"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, household and transport are treated as elementary goods
 (i.e.
 no quality variation is assumed and only the cost of the items is considered).
 The cross-price effects for the items in the survey for 2010, 2012 and
 2014 are also presented to provide an insight into how prices of non-food
 items may have an effect on food quality and vice versa.

With these goals in mind, we now compare two variants of the AIDS model

 We assess their relevance, shortcomings before suggesting an aggregated
 model that is adapted to our goals.
 In the first variant, a detailed item-wise analysis of cross-price elasticities
 is provided (Heien-Wessells

 The second AIDS variant (McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) uses the measure of quality (as defined above) - except for electricity
 (which is simply an indicator variable).
 Asset ownership (log of cost of the asset - which is available in the survey)
 are included as controls variables in the latter variant.
 In the end we continue to argue in favour of discrete methods - which we
 believe would make more sense in the status consumption contexts where
 the ownership of long-term durable goods needs to be considered.

The first AIDS variant uses non-consumption corrected estimates of demand
 elasticities to explain the effect of prices and household income on the
 demand for every item.
 The first part of this method is a selection step - needed to account for
 the non-consumption of a certain items.
 In the second part, a pooled static-AIDS method as described above (see
 Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and

) is used on the consumption microdata from 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-part i.e.
 selection is a probit that provides refinement to the second-part item-wise
 AIDS (which would have been appropriate in a more homogeneous dataset with
 less instances of non-consumption for items).
 The dependent variable in the probit is an indicator variable which is
 unity when the item is consumed and zero otherwise.
 The control variables used in the first-stage probit are the prices of
 the item and market-characteristics (region etc.
 - see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

) .
 The inverse-imlls ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 part (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation.

 (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 These AIDS equations used are evidently fewer than those in the item-wise
 censored model of the first AIDS variant.
 This is because every commodity aggregate - comprising of several items
 - corresponds to one aggregate quantity/budget equation and a quality metric
 corresponding to the commodity aggregate.
 The aggregation also circumvents the issue of non-consumption since it
 is much less likely for no items to be consumed within a functional commodity
 group (fruits-veg, starch, protein etc.).

Notice that while such an AIDS formulation does not model the intertemporal
 substitution, the condition C1 allows us to compare the quality variation
 in certain commodity groups with the durable good possession in others.
 The commodity groups used for our analyses are food, energy, household
 and transportation.
 We use the CPI for housing and transportation since the expenditure on
 them is considered elementary consumption (these are categories where assets
 are deemed more important).
 In other words, no quality differences are observed in consumption on household
 items (toilet rolls, clothing etc.) or transportation.
 The expenditure on housing and transportation are treated as if they were
 (each) just one commodity whereas different variants of proteins and starches
 (i.e.
 goods) are considered.

 A functional category is one where there is a sufficient degree of substitution
 possible amongst its members.
 As an example, goat and beef are put under the same group - but not with
 tea - as there is little sense in substitution between tea and meat.
 The food category is further divided into sub-categories so that demands
 within the category can be considered separable in both the functional
 sense and the price-movement sense (which is the basis of the computation

LSMS survey uses diary method for food and recall methods for non-food items.
 While we are interested in how sparsely some items are consumed, we are
 careful not to interpret the absence of an item in the recall record for
 a household as the item not being used by the household.
 This is because not all items in the recall diary are recorded at the same
 frequency - some items in the survey are recorded as they're recalled from
 a month before the interview - while others may be recalled from the year
 before the interview.
 Similarly, the an interpretation of the differences in the budget share
 over snapshots (2010, 2012 and 2014) for a particular household and item-
 cannot be interpreted as a consumption pattern of a household since we
 may not have the records in the recall diary for all three instances of
 the survey (2010, 2012 and 2014)

 The descriptive statistics do not suggest a common trend for consumption
 of items that are rare or expensive items.
 Items that seem rarely consumed and are higher-priced may in fact be of
 completely disparate utility.
 On one hand, we have tea and coffee that are expensive but are used in
 very low quantities and on the other, we have skin-cream that despite their
 apparent importance for

 - as is common in the literature on consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 - shows the relevance of occupation, education and housing-status (owned/rented
/employer-provided).
 For carpets, one finds the housing-status more relevant and for electricity,
 residence-area is more relevant.
 The functional role that every high-price items plays is therefore critical
 to what may be claimed for any status benefit they may carry.

 As the weekly data is mixed with yearly data, an extrapolation of past
 week's consumption becomes necessary.
 Since larger families are more likely to underestimate their purchases
 when recalling, such an extrapolation can overestimate food costs.
 To address this issue, we use adjustment factors both for the multiples
 used in extrapolation of weekly/monthly data (based on their usage pattern)
 and for the number of family members (i.e.
 older family and children are not counted as exactly 1 family member).

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the data - as is character
istic of a developing country.
 Out of the households who consumption diary is available, only around 30%
 have any reported income.
 Amongst those who have a reported income, having two jobs and owning multiple
 self-owned (small) businesses is not uncommon and the mode of payment is
 often non-cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the inference of income noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 Given the sparsity of available income data and its poor quality, we choose
 to use the occupation ranks (which are correlated with the observed income)
 for the current study.

Matching of Prices with Items consumed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted before, out of the food, energy, transport and household commodity
 groups, we only consider quality differences in food and energy subgroups
 - whereas the other commodity groups are viewed as groups where asset possessio
n (or ownership of long-term durable goods) matters more than quality variation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prices observed in the market drive our measure of quality and the later
 discussion of cross-price effects.
 Since we don't use price-deflators in our analysis (due to measurement
 errors that arise with quantity being in both in the denominator of the
 control variables and in the numerator of the dependent variable), a matching
 of prices of the items observed in the market (identified by region and
 district) with the prices of the items purchased by the consumer (with
 known region and district) is of key importance to our analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LSMS Tanzania surveys record the prices observed in the markets spread across

\begin_layout Enumerate
A lot of items in the year 2008 were recorded with the unit as pieces/"idadi"
 (e.g.
 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These items were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,

 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk items where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the items where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
\end_layout

.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not

\begin_layout Enumerate
While a household in the LSMS consumption data is identified down to the
 village and enumeration area level - we do not expect the surveys to record
 market-prices at every possible enumeration area and village.
 We thus associate a district level price to a household's consumed item.
 In other words, the price of an item consumed by a household is linked
 to all households in the same district where the household is located.
 We make no attempts to arrive at a price granularity lower than that of
 a district.
 When there are multiple price observations at the district level, we arrive
 a district-level price using a regression (discussed below).
 Further, when the prices are not available at the district levels, we use
 the regional averages (i.e.
 the next level of granularity available).
 For items such as electricity and gas that are limited to a few urban areas,
 we simply use the price at a national level

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now describe the regression of marked-price against quantity that we
 use to assimilate the price data from the survey.
 To explain this regression, let's consider an example of the marked prices
 of rice (let's say) for 1 kg, 2kg, 5kg and 10kg in the market.
 A typical set of marked prices could be 4£, 7.5£, 18£ and 35£ respectively
 - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

 for the plot of these example prices.
 As is often the case, such unit-prices grow at a less than linear rate
 as is shown in the plot of the unit-price corresponding to the quantities
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore a linear regression of 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 is the marked price of the item and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 the quantity consumed) is hardly appropriate.
 The goal of the regression is to arrive at the price of unit-quantity (e.g.
 the price per kg for rice in the current example) rather than matching
 the appropriate marked price with the quantity purchased by the consumer
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we were to really look for a perfect match for prices, then we should
 not only match the quantities consumed by the consumer with the prices
 recorded in the market but also the time of the household interview with
 that of the price recorded.
 This fine matching is both impractical (survey prices being hardly available
 at such fine levels of granularity) and unnecessary since our view of price
 is that of a value that is faced by a sufficiently large number of consumers
 in the survey.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The regression we use therefore is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 (assuming that the marked price is lower than a linear increase - see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

 - by a factor that itself decreases with increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $mp=aq-b/q$
\end_inset

).
 Since we use the price set 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

, the price to be used is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 for the regression: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta/q^{2}+c$
\end_inset

.
 The regression is run only when more than two prices are available.
 When the regression can't be used a simple median is used as the price
 for such cases
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This does not happen as frequently as one may imagine.
 For 2010, only 9 identified regions for just 6 items have less than three
 marked-prices available.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The price-inference is therefore a 2-stage process - we first obtain prices
 for every district with the regression method.
 If there are no marked prices available in a district, we use the regional
 value of the price.
 For some items, the region-prices are not available for some regions.
 Here, the price from obtained by the regressions over the country is used
 for the item.
 The prices for some items whose consumption is relatively rare in the diary
 data (e.g.
 wild-birds and honey) are not available for any of the regions.
 These items are ignored for the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the prices we obtain after the regression, we match the price for every
 commodity consumed by the household based on the district it is located
 in.
 The next step is to define commodity groups based on the observed price-structu
re.
 We use a broad classification of items for separability assumption to hold.
 Within foods we observe protein, fruits, dense-foods, complements and non-fresh
 groups and within energy, we put kerosene and electricity under the same
 group (energy).
 The composite commodity theorem restrictions - more particularly the constant
 relative price structure - being a requirement for quality elasticities
 to make sense, the classification of commodity groups is also driven by
 the market price-structure.
 In commodity groups where an aggregate quality is calculated, the classificatio
n is defined so as to take into account both the functional separability
 and price-structure.
 A clustering of regression coefficients is used for the classification
 for items whose prices are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can argue that a selection bias is introduced when we use the national-avera
ges for some items and region averages for other.
 This could be a problem if the unavailability of regional averages occurred
 for a significant portion of price entries.
 However, since only about 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim4\%$
\end_inset

 of the total price observations have no regional averages, the bias thus
 introduced would be rather insignificant.
 Another issue could be taken with our grouping of commodities - as it relies
 on the annual time-series data.
 It is indeed possible that the price of some items may be more volatile
 than the others - and thus the volatility being ignored in the annual time
 series data would bring some bias.
 But since we combine the household log diary with the recall diary (which
 is recorded on a monthly or yearly basis), a finer time-series for prices
 is not enough to address this issue.
 Such a bias could be alleviated only through finer price data

The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).
 The results thus obtained with a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) after
 imposing the constraints are presented in the Table

 The own-price and cross-price elasticities in the results provide us an
 overview of the demand across rare and commonly consumed items.
 We base our interpretation on both the the statistical significance (value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

) and the economic significance (i.e.
 the size of the coefficient) of the control variables in the results.
 Observing the signs of the coefficients, we see that mangoes (less consumed)
 and rice (commonly consumed) are substitutes while fish is a complement
 to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.) rice.
 Further, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_flo
ur]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens but a substitute to bread and mangoes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The item-wise analysis suggests a split between the items that are consumed
 in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant) against
 those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer are more
 readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education also show that the items
 available in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive
 elasticities for income and education rank whereas the items of agrarian
 production seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations
 huddled in the urban areas.
 While many of such insights could be offered with a simpler cross-sectional
 analysis using a regression of expenditure on the item against the permanent-in
come or total expenditure by the household etc.
 (an approach that is followed in much of the literature on conspicuous
 consumption
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,KausSA,CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

), an AIDS formulation is favoured due to two reasons - first it allows
 us to understand the cross-price effects in a more robust framework and
 second, it can account for the non-consumption of items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further with the cross-elasticities analyses, a comparison of how
 consumers respond to changes in kerosene and electricity prices further
 confirms the concentrated availability of industrial items.
 A contrast between the items that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this split
 - since the demand for items such as rice, beef is less sensitive to electricit
y than it is to kerosene.
 That is to say, it isn't simply that the electricity consumers are more
 likely to consume the more expensive items (due to their higher incomes)
 but that a certain items become less relevant in the urban settings or
 are simply unavailable in the rural settings.
 We argue that such a segregation of consumer contexts is relevant for a
 discussion of status-related consumption in the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, despite the detailed report on cross-elasticities, there are limitation
s to an item-wise approach.
 First, the detailed cross-elasticities are more likely to fluctuate over
 time and would require us to use a dynamic approach to ascertain model
 stability (an inertia in choices could be more explicitly modeled to address
 this).
 Second, the cross-price elasticities fail to model the functional separation
 in consumption e.g.
 the lack of substitutability between energy and food items.
 For example, the cross-elasticities of kerosene with respect to buns or
 cassava cannot be interpreted unless one imposes other assumptions on the
 closely observed consumption patterns (e.g.
 more buns would means less cooking in the household etc.) or stricter separabili
ty assumptions (see Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonUnderstandingConsumption"

\end_inset

 for a discussion on the need to impose such structures).
 Since we are concerned with the choice of quality exercised by the consumer
 when faced with multiple varieties of several qualities and price, an aggregate
d view of the basket seems more appropriate.
 Such an aggregation ought to be based on a well-defined criteria - which
 for our current approach is the price of the items as well as the functionality
 of commodities.
 The availability of price information between the years 2008 and 2014 prevents
 the problems that could be faced by other grouping criteria - such as visibilit
y (used in much of the literature on conspicuous consumption) - the changes
 to which are not observed over a sufficiently long period of time.

An LA-AIDS model for Aggregate Quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregated view adds the functional view to the consumer choice that
 is not available in an item-wise approach.
 Observing consumption at a higher level with separability assumptions facilitat
es the interpretation of cross-price effects.
 Whenever aggregation is possible (subject to restrictions), it allows us
 to interpret the consumer choice for quality - while representing the substitut
ion between broader categories and the price variants within the commodities
 in the econometric model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the aggregation provides an intermediate step to merging the data
 from recall and diary methods.
 As items are often recorded with more details for the diary items than
 for the recall items (the types of phones, clothes purchased by the consumers
 are hardly recorded in the surveys for example), the merging of data from
 recall and diary methods is rendered inappropriate.
 An aggregation can represent the diary data at a coarser granularity -
 which can be matched with that of the recall method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result, the price-based aggregation in the second AIDS variant - which
 we have adapted to our requirements - allows us to have a discussion on
 quality that was somewhat adhoc with an item-wise approach of the first
 variant.
 The inclusion of assets and the expenditure data from recall methods on
 household-transportation further helps us explain how the expenditure on
 quality may change within the population.
 As would be amenable to a permanent income approach, the consumer habits
 do seem to be influenced by the financial standing of the consumer that
 we have attempted to gauge with the assets owned by consumers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To advance the discussion of asset ownership and quality, we include the
 recall data on household and transport commodities.
 Since we ignore quality differences in the expenditure on transport and
 categories, the AIDS SUR equations use household-CPI and transport-CPI
 as the prices for these respective groups (no 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ V$
\end_inset

 equations are required for the two commodity groups).
 As we use the assets owned for the two groups in these equations instead,
 the asset-costs for transport and household groups are included as household
 characteristics (asset costs are total cost of items possessed by a household
 in particular commodity group).
 Other household characteristics used in the AIDS SUR equations are family
 size (
\family typewriter
consu
\family default
), age of the household-head (
\family typewriter
age
\family default
), occupation-rank (
\family typewriter
occupation_rank
\family default
), education-rank (
\family typewriter
educ_rank
\family default
) and expensive region( 
\family typewriter
expensive_region
\family default
 - which indicates densely populated urban areas).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a significant portion of urban income is spent on electricity, we look
 at the quality choices of electricity users in particular.
 an indicator variable for whether the consumer uses electricity or not
 (available in the data through the "lighting source" used by the household)
 is used as one of the household characteristics
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One could use this indicator variable as the dependent variable (in place
 of
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ V$
\end_inset

 ) in the AIDS budget-share equations.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsAllassets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 In an alternate formulation in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:RobustnessChecks"

\end_inset

, a variable showing the total cost of electric assets is used as one of
 the household characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the classification based on prices and functionality, the groups chosen
 for the model are - densefoods, non-fresh, fruits-veg, protein, complements,
 energy, household and transport (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Groups"

\end_inset

).
 Here, the quality measure is not used for energy, household and transport.
 Thus, the total number of equations to estimate with the seemingly unrelated
 regression is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times5+3\times1=13$
\end_inset

.
 The results obtained from the SUR that are shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsAllassets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 confirm many of the findings from the itemwise-probit but also suggest
 the relevance of asset ownership in the demand for non-durable items -
 their quality in particular.
 The life-style differences that we observe in non-durable consumption -
 with respect to the quality of items (indicated with variables starting
 with 
\family typewriter
qV
\family default
-) seem associated with the assets owned by the consumers and whether they
 use electricity or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth differentiating between the effect that ownership of assets
 has on quality vs the one the effect of total expenditure
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The literature often uses total expenditure as a measure of permanent income.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Those with electrical assets (the logarithm of whose total cost is used
 as the control variable) tend to spend more on fruits-veg quality.
 With higher expenditure (
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
), the quality of non-fresh increases but the quality of fruits-veg decreases.
 Those who own more long-term assets spend relatively less on quality of
 protein and transport (public_transport, car maintenance etc.) - commodities
 where those how have electricity seem to spend more.
 It seems that just starting to use electricity (but not having lots of
 electric assets) can increase the quality of protein consumed for the represent
ative consumer (see the effect of the 
\family typewriter
has_electric
\family default
 variable in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsSubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running another SUR with assets split into electrical, household and transport
 assets confirm the same results (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsSubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Here, as one would expect, the consumption on energy is high for electricity
 asset owners due to the high prices of electricity in Tanzania.
 The owners of electrical assets also consume more fruits-veg quality and
 have more expenditure on household products.
 Here too, slightly lower fruitsveg quality is associated total expenditure
 (
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
).
 While those with more assets spend less on some food quality categories,
 they do spend more on the household-related non-durable consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variable 
\family typewriter
expensive_region
\family default
 is significant for non-fresh quality, protein quality, household commodity
 group, transport commodity group and the energy commodity group.
 Within urban areas, having electricity is associated with higher protein
 and fruits-veg quality.
 The urban consumers may have less overall assets compared to their counterparts
 in rural areas but they spend more on quality on protein and fruits-veg
 (less on dense-foods and household asset).
 The above observations hint at the life-style differences in the densely
 populated urban areas brought about by - amongst other things - the availabilit
y of electricity and industrial goods.

Robustness Checks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure that the relevance of high asset ownership in differences of quality
 is a robust observation, we rerun the SUR with an aggregated food category.
 This formulation no longer uses the price-based groups and views all food-subca
tegories as one food group
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The quality is still calculated based on the prices.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 Using the CPI of food basket as prices (just the way transport CPI and
 household CPI are used) the above analysis is repeated with food, energy,
 transport and household as separable categories.
 In the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsFoodCPIAllAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsFoodCPISubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, a preference for higher quality for electricity users and household asset
 owners is observed when we use a food aggregate (a collection of the subcategor
ies).
 Food quality increases with total expenditure and with acquisition of household
 assets.
 As one would expect, transport costs are higher in the urban areas.
 The non-durable expenditure on household items and overall food quality
 both decrease for urban areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a further test of the robustness of results, we calculate the food-quality
 using the market-provided prices.
 More specifically, the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{resultsAllassets}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 we have used diary-costs on goods as reported by the consumer.
 However, the LSMS records this cost only from the items that were consumed
 from purchases in the last week.
 If a consumer didn't purchase anything in the past week, there would only
 be quantities consumed (not costs) that would be reported for the consumer
 in the diary.
 Since we have the market-prices available, another way to calculate costs,
 budget-shares and quality would be to infer costs as the multiple of market-pri
ces from the quantities consumed in the past week (which is reported for
 all consumers regardless of whether they had purchased something in the
 last week or not).
 Recalculating quality and budget shares still shows us the same economic
 and statistical significance (results available on request) of electricity
 and household assets in quality of fruitsveg, proteins and other subcategories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth reiterating that the differences in quality should be seen as
 more than just response to high prices in the urban areas.
 As our quality metric is derived from locally available prices (the base
 price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 can be different in every district), it already accounts for regional differenc
es in prices.
 One possible explanation is that the focus on industrial goods and meat
 categories is stronger in urban areas and is maintained as consumer habits.
 A comparison of quality differences amongst the population in other countries
 could verify this argument i.e.
 if quality differences for a certain commodity groups are found significant
 with respect to the long-term socio-economic standing of the consumer in
 other markets.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the differences in consumer baskets for the urban and rural consumer,
 it should not be surprising that those in the urban areas spend differently
 on certain non-durable items.
 Nevertheless, the sustained quality differences for meat and fresh goods
 for urban consumers indicate a peculiar environmental difference in the
 urban areas - particularly sensitive to the distribution of electricity
 and availability of public transport.
 We find that it is not just that those with higher asset worth tend to
 buy more - but the quality purchased for a few categories always appears
 higher (lower) for the consumers who own medium-cost assets and lower (higher)
 for consumers who don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the urban areas, the households that don't own assets would benefit
 from spending more on industrial goods than an equivalent consumer in the
 rural area who does not face the same choice of industrial goods.
 This should be considered in a discussion of status consumption.
 The consumer in the urban areas may be willing to sacrifice quality in
 one group to avail it in another.
 A segmentation of quality is not due to a fundamental shift in demand for
 quality in the urban areas.
 Such a segregation of quality (in food or in other non-durable commodities)
 only implies that pricier meats or electrical items are made available
 to the urban food consumer - that may let her deprioritse the quality in
 other commodities.
 Therefore, instead of arguing whether electricity or electrical items have
 signaling qualities or not, we propose that the idea of relative quality
 of common commodities (and under common needs) be considered in a discussion
 of status consumption.
 A preference order for consumption of quality - that can exist as long
 term habits for the consumer - provides a useful extension to the idea
 of signaling goods for developing markets.
 It also addresses the apparent incongruence of visible consumption with
 the functional separability of utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed as we observe relatively higher consumption on household items for
 those with better occupations, a certain degree of compensation (or pecuniary
 emulation) cannot be ruled out in the data
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that houses are included in the household-assets.
 The observation that home-owners spend differently on non-durable consumption
 in the household category is also included as part of the observations
 on household-assets.

 either.
 However, such an observation on visible items (in the household commodity
 group) would easily fit within the framework of quality and the socio-economic
 standing which we propose.
 There is after all more to status consumption than compensation - which
 can fall within a wider substitution between consuming quality and planning
 for longer-term assets (including education etc.).
 In terms of the model for quality and socio-economic standing, a consumer
 doesn't compensate or emulate the behaviour of the rich as much as she
 chooses which commodity she can improve quality on - subject to her needs
 and her budget.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, instead of focusing on the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

signaling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items that those with perceived lesser status would consume - we have set
 ourselves to exploring the factors that may influence the perception of
 status itself.
 The choice for quality may be influenced by the owned long-term assets
 - which along with the commodity quality chosen drive the perception of
 status in the model.
 There are more reasons to consider these differences in the developing
 countries where inequalities are wider.
 Further, if it is possible to model the acquisition of assets over time,
 an intertemporal setting could enhance our understanding of how quality
 of expenditure changes over time - allowing us to provide more robust insights
 on how long-term utility inclusive of status is indicated through consumption.

Historical developments in sub-Saharan Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The landscape of the political history of sub-Saharan African is dominated
 by anti-colonial movements in the past century.
 While it seems natural to hope for Adam Smith's principles to take hold
 in the nascent economies of the newly formed republics in the sub-Saharan
 Africa, neither the economic development nor the collective defense of
 nationalistic interests have followed a path similar to that of the developed
 world.
 The industrial class in the African countries is still poor in absolute
 terms and the problems of extreme poverty have remained largely unresolved
 in the large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa.
 The administrative successes and stabilities of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before.
 The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires,
 for example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries
 when compared to the administrative units (much as the political boundaries
 themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The processes of decolonization - which started in the late last century
 - have encompassed the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia
 and Africa aspiring to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 (often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike) their reach and success has been limited.
 in the developing world is that the goals aimed for by Adam Smith - of
 replacing feudalistic rent-seeking with fairness, equity and reward for
 hard-work - have been attempted more often with the nationalistic or socialist
 movements than free trade.
 The role of state has been an uncertain force in the developing world and
 has thus shaped identities at least as much as the evolution of market
 for industrial goods have.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Nigeria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The access to education is varied in Nigeria - because of the different
 levels of successes missionary education had in Nigeria.
 This in turn has created regional disparities in the current education
 levels between the northern and southern parts of Nigeria.
 The north has had a higher Islamic influence and the uniformity desired
 by the post-colonial government had had some initial challenges.
 At the start of the republic, it seemed that the market forces had been
 left relatively untouched - due to nature of the British rule which encouraged
 participation of a native authority.
 At the same time, the wage labour surviving on the peasantry was a trend
 that continued well into the post-colonial era.
 When the movements of African socialism in Nigeria picked up their momentum,
 the power of merchant class became limited.
 In the more recent decades, when MNCs could have brought more power to
 a working middle class, their presence hasn't changed the state of capital
 being controlled by a small minority - an environment where only the state
 monopolized industries and the informal sector seem to have expanded

.
 The recent Base of Pyramid (BoP) initiatives have not created a sufficient
 base for entrepreneurs, but they have indeed revived a focus on education
 and expanded the market for industrial goods.
 An average of 42% workforce in Nigeria have secondary education or higher.
 Upto 28% of those in mere survival activities have a secondary school certifica
te, and 12% have post-secondary qualifications

 Newly urbanized indigenous tribes and educated classes have taken up jobs
 that had earlier required a much lower level of education.
 The crowding hardly resolves the underlying problems with the economy -
 as the formal sector remains in doldrums.
 The state of economy, rapid population rise and the resulting migration
 from rural areas has given rise to problems urban overcrowding unmitigated
 by a large informal sector

Tanzania 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Given its engagement in the liberation movements in Mozambique in 1974 and
 the faith in planned economy inculcated by Nyrere, it would not be inaccurate
 to consider Tanzania the epicentre of the African socialism.
 But once the political independence was achieved in Tanzania, the membership
 of nationalist parties declined and the separation of civil service from
 political institutions became less of a priority.
 The faith in socialist planning under the leadership of Nyrere meant that
 the reduction of private sector did not experience much opposition.
 With a lack of support from its workers and a ban on producer-consumer
 societies, the socialist model seemed to have had some inconsistencies.
 In the decades after the independence, the industrial sector continued
 to suffer because of import subsidies.
 An import substituting industrialization (ISI) led to oversubsidizing when
 the need to prevent mass starvation called for an adjustment to capital
 flows.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and the use of a capital-intensive technology
 caused the oversubsidizing to spread further across other sectors.
 Subsequently, an over-reliance on capital for development resulted in decline
 of the industrial capacity utilization

 - many arguing that the workforce had moved to a subsistence through cultivatio
n approach.
 In its modern economy, only the public officials have had the advantage
 of becoming entrepreneurs.
 Even though imports could have improved the Tanzanian exchange rate - the
 problems around corruption have always posed limitations to trade reforms
 in Tanzania (particularly in the energy sector)

 With state regulated economy having had no ways to expand, the growth of
 parallel economy has been unavoidable - leaving a disconnect between the
 parallel markets and a protectionist trade policy.
 More recently, the firms from South Africa and China have increasingly
 participated in Tanzania while the training programs for the local labour
 and the plans to develop local infrastructure languish.
 The conflicts between the miners and SA migrant labour are common - while
 many Tanzanians are sent to South Africa for training

 Electricity is only available to about 10% of the population.
 The use of internet communications is higher in Tanzania than in Africa's
 average but access to finance is low (albeit rising) for the private sector.

Having achieved independence from Portugal in 1975, the competition between

 Similar to other post-colonial economies, the state-controlled companies
 thrived in Angola.
 In the view of Western economists, the state oil company Sonagol seemed
 to have played a quasi-fiscal role.
 The economy's dependence on oil revenues made economic diversification

The political power is influenced by many ethnicities in Kenya and the clan

 Due to this reason, the policy changes can quickly develop into ethnic
 conflicts.
 For example, when resettlement was attempted under Kenyatta's leadership,
 the discontent was predominantly from non-

 Other attempts at nationalization - e.g.
 taking control of foods sales or establishment of purchase centres - have
 met with similar confrontations.

 to them has not been addressed either by the socialist governments or the
 growing private sector

Obtained income data from Section E (currently ignored for analysis for
 it being sparse).
 Here, the recorded pay frequency was in hours, days, weeks, months, fortnights,
 months, quarter, half year or year - while the mandatory fields corresponding
 to all of these units were i) number of hours worked per week ii) number
 of weeks worked per month and iii) number of months worked in an year .

When pay was on a per-hour basis, the number of hours worked per week (provided)
 was multiplied with the number of weeks worked per month (provided).
 This product was then multiplied with the number of months worked per year
 (provided) to estimate the annual income.

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 The LSMS survey records the quantities for food items - even if they were
 not purchased in the past week.
 But for other non-food items (such as soap, skin creams whose quantities
 are not recorded in the survey) are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families as well.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption.
 To verify that this not a significant issue, we first test if such stocking
 (quantities purchased) may be uniform in all region in the country.
 We then test the significance of household factors that may affect long-term
 storage (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) of the purchased item.
 Observing the quantity purchased on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure on all items 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we use a difference-in-means analysis to confirm the low effect of travel-cost
s on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{e}{x})$
\end_inset

 and conclude that stockpiling is not significant.
 It turns out that the number of family members is a far more significant
 factor for large purchases.

For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wide categories of energy, transport and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.
