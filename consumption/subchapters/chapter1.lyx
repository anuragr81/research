\begin_layout Abstract
The measures of status consumption often explore the expenditure on a basket
 of visible items.
 Instead on limiting ourselves to the notion of visibility in a developing
 economy, we view status consumption as high-quality in non-durable consumption
 commodities chosen by the consumer to offset hierarchies implied by households
 characteristic such as education, regional identity and long-term assets.
 Arguing that difference in quality for even basic commodities must encompass
 status in poorer economies, we test empirically if the quality vectors
 corresponding to the basic commodities are significantly different for
 those with higher long-term assets after accounting for income and if there
 is a significant overspending on quality among middle-income consumers
 in urban circumstances.

\begin_layout Standard
Viewing status consumption as a set of quality vectors across commodities,
 does having more assets significantly influence the consumer's expenditure
 on high-quality (after accounting for income and the price of basic commodities
)? If so, do consumers with lower- and medium- level asset possession spend
 higher or lower on price-based quality?

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies on visible consumption have explored how expenditure on visible
 goods - items not necessary for the consumer except for signaling status
 - varies in consumer populations

 We find two issues with the approach in the context of developing economies.
 First, in a population where the majority lives at subsistence level, the
 quality in non-visible goods may also be indicative of status.
 Second, there may be long-term assets that both serve necessities and indicate
 status

The visibility surveys used in the literature are often adjusted to take
 into account the environment of wider inequalities of the developing world.

 may associate with a certain

 for the role of income differences in status consumption.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While these effects are of little significance in relatively equal societies
 with strong institutions for social welfare, the two concerns are of importance
 in understanding status consumption in the developing economies where most
 consumers may not report having long-term assets and struggle with basic
 needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the particular context of sub-Saharan African, while the rapid economic
 development tempt one to draw parallels from Veblen's ideas of conspicuous
 consumption formulated in the 19th century North America, the limited mobility
 available to the masses in developing economies often present a landscape
 different from that of America's gilded age (see Ustuner et al.

\end_inset

 for a critique of the

\end_inset

 view of status consumption).
 In the environment of nascent economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, the
 options for conspicuous consumption are still limited to a very small part
 of the population.
 Observing the consumption microdata in the sub-Saharan African economies,
 we find that the notion of status consumption - which needs to be general
 enough to encompass the interactions and consumption of the majority of
 consumers - is more appropriately interpreted as high quality in overall
 non-durable consumption than notions of visibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, we view status consumption as the expenditure on non-durable
 consumption made to either overcome or enhance the role of long-term assets
 and demographic characteristics such as education, class or region associated
 with the household.
 The argument relies on status being shaped by two components.
 First is the stable component that stays unchanged in the short-term.
 This component includes long-established states e.g.
 education, occupation, ancestral social roles and long-term assets.
 The second component - the consumption that may offset the wide differences
 created by the first component - is what we measure as status consumption.
 The differences among the consumers with different long-term assets in
 terms of the non-durable consumption plus the small non-inheritable assets
 purchased provide us a way to measure the status consumption in the current
 chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The possible segmentation of quality based on owned assets is thus key to
 our view of status consumption.
 To avoid confusion of terms in the future discussion on goods and quality,
 we use the nomenclature provided by Cramer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 so that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

goods
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or

\end_inset

items
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are variants with different quality that all fall under a certain

commodity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (see Cox
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CoxWohlgenant1986"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for further notes on this nomenclature).
 Since i) a consumer improves quality in food and other commodity groups
 when her income rises and ii) since status can be improved with consumption
 only through either non-durable or durable consumption, the improvement
 and sustenance of quality across multiple commodity groups carries status
 among those with the same asset-ownership levels.
 In an economy where most of the population lives at subsistence with no
 reported assets, status must be indicated through overall quality in non-durabl
e consumption in additional to the long-term assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While non-durable quality may provide a more relevant overview of status
 consumption in the developing economies, it does not benefit from the implicit
 assumption of separability implied by the futility status consumption.
 More specifically, the assumption that visible goods are of no utility
 other than signaling implies that the utility from visible consumption
 is additively separable (see Ireland or Hopkins-Kornienko).
 Interpreting status consumption as high quality in commodities forgoes
 this assumption and requires us to follow more stringent conditions of
 separability.
 More particularly, the substitution between all goods of higher quality
 cannot be argued in the same way as one may argue for substitution (and
 thus aggregation) among visible goods that have no utility (and are futile
 - an assumption attributed to Veblen's
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 views on conspicuous consumption).
 Our empirical assessment is simplified nevertheless due to the fact that
 not all commodities may be dominated by quality of non-durable consumption.
 Since status differences among consumers through commodities such as transport
 are more likely to be through the assets such as a car owned by the consumer
 households, the variation in quality can be ignored for non-durable consumption
 in commodities such as household or transport goods if the respective assets
 (transport- or household- related assets) have already been considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the analysis that follows, we test if there are significant differences
 in quality associated with higher levels of asset ownership in a developing
 country.
 The magnitude of these differences could rule out any status competitions
 among the separated groups and undermine any advantage from status consumption
 through offsetting of long-term hierarchies of long-term assets.
 Focusing on the Tanzanian LSMS data for years 2010, 2012 and 2014, we compare
 the quality across four commodity cateogries - food, energy, transport
 and household - against the needs units (the number of family members adjusted
 for age) and the long-term socio-economic standing (measured with transferable
 assets and personal/demographic characteristics
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The tracking of the long-term economic standing of the consumer as a vector
 of income, education and region/locality/neighborhood (apart from the long-term
 durable goods) is similar to the use of socio-economic-indicators (SES)

) in the economy.
 Here, the needs of the consumers are proxied by the number of members (age-adju
sted) in the household and quality is measured using the quantity consumed
 of high vs low-price variants of the commodity.
 Eggs and milk are - for example -deemed of lower quality than goat and
 beef for proteins.
 The quality variation is ignored for household and transport categories
 except for what is implied by the assets in the consumption categories
 (household and transport) and assessed only for food and energy.
 With the AIDS formulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

rship levels appear as control variables in the AIDS equations while the
 quality-choices along with budget-shares appear as dependent variables.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that the focus on quality in non-durable consumption reduces the
 subjective judgments employed in the classification of visible goods.
 Status - which motivates conspicuous consumption - is a complex social
 psychological phenomenon and is likely to create a bias in deciding whether
 an item is a status good or not.
 For example, if one were to rely only on whether an item can be afforded
 by the rich - then electricity, being used by a small and rich part of
 the population in a sub-Saharan African country like Tanzania, may appear
 to be a status good - at par with weddings (which are a clearer way of
 indicating status).
 But whether the same amount of money spent on weddings enhances status
 more than when it's spent on electricity is a far more difficult question
 to answer.
 Similarly, one could argue that buying clothes indicates higher status
 and go on to record the consumption on clothes as conspicuous consumption.
 But without observing the effect that getting electricity in the house
 or moving to a bigger house may have on a consumer's long-term utility
 and the perceived status, we cannot assume a significant status-benefit
 to the consumer from expenditure on clothing - since the possibility that
 those spending on recently installed electricity or a newly built house
 may actually be cutting down on clothing expenditure while deriving status
 from electricity or house ownership cannot be ruled out.
 In the developed economies, the extreme differences in assets are usually
 less and the focus on visible goods alone makes more sense as the status
 differences are more difficult to create in a more equal society.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue with status goods is that they are hardly static - as the
 demand for newly introduced goods - e.g.
 a smart-phone or a TV - changes quickly.
 Unlike the consumer poll methods used to identify visible goods in the
 literature on conspicuous consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility,ZahraIndia"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 , the quality-based view of status consumption relies on a dynamic price-based
 interpretation and can be used for understanding changes in consumer habits
 over time.
 We believe that this general view of status would be more suited for a
 comparison of status consumption across various social contexts in other
 developing economies and allow the assimilation of wide-ranging social
 observations on conspicuous consumption.

 Houthakker's post-war analysis of family surveys
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Allowing the consumer utility to optimise both quality and quantity while
 treating quality as a separate good, Houthakker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 decomposed the quality price elasticity of demand (quantity purchased)
 into a quantity price elasticity of expenditure on quality and an income
 elasticity of quality measure.
 The treatment of quality as a separate good has since been widely used
 in the literature.
 One such application is the simple repackaging method, where a high-quality
 good is seen as multiples of the lower quality good(s).
 If the quality for a (composite) good is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and the base-price is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

, an adjusted-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is sought so that:

\begin_layout Standard
The demand for goods with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{3}$

 is viewed in terms of both the base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and the quality parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\{b_{1},b_{2},...\}$
\end_inset

).
 Considering 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\theta)$
\end_inset

 as a function of the quality parameter, one uses the following cost-function
 transformation (see Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implicit assumption in the repackaging approach is that the variants
 in every category are perfect substitutes.
 Due to this reason, the empirical application of the repackaging method
 for commodities where there are extreme differences in quality are difficult
 to justify.
 A consumer switching from kerosene usage to electricity usage - despite
 the improvement in energy 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - may not be satisfactorily explained by viewing electricity consumption
 in terms of the quantity and price of kerosene consumed.
 The simple-repackaging model has been more often used in the context of
 the cost-of-living index problem where such a substitution is implied (see
 the classical application from Fisher-Shell

More recent approaches to measuring quality

key "NelsonQualityQuantity,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,AndalonGibsonSoda2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 have relied on the consumed quantities of goods.
 These methods have been limited to analysis for food quality - likely due
 to absence of quantities consumed for non-food commodities in the consumer
 surveys.
 While the measure of quality based on quantities consumed is often used
 for an overview of food quality, the issue of unavailability of market
 prices (and thereby of quality) in such measurements for quality has only
 been recently given some attention 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 More specifically, the measurement of quality is often performed without
 the available market prices by simply averaging over the expenditures in
 a given region (or over the entire population of consumers).
 The so-called implicit price-deflator (or unit-value) method uses these
 averages in place of prices in the empirical analyses (see Tafere et al
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a recent implementation).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While price-deflators may be appropriate for certain empirical questions,
 the measurement errors introduced by their use are difficult to ignore
 for finer conclusions related to price and income elasticities.
 More particularly, the quantity consumed appearing both in the dependent
 variable (as budget share's numerator) and in the control variable (as
 the denominator for unit-value used as price) cannot be always mitigated
 for many questions related to consumer preferences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"

\end_inset

.
 Since the market prices available in the survey prevents such measurements
 errors (see the discussion by McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and Gibson

 In this current, we therefore also avoid other approaches such as the RDMP

 Further, the method can be extended to other panel data scenarios as well.
 For instance, the structural changes in the parameters over time are addressed
 with a dynamic AIDS formulation (see Anderson and Blundell

Differentiating high-quality goods from the low-quality goods within a particula
r commodity (good) also poses the issue of non-consumption of high-quality
 goods.
 If one were to calculate the price elasticities for high-quality and low-qualit
y goods separately, an obvious issue is that high-quality goods might not
 be consumed at all for a significant part of the consumer population.

 Further, the unit-values obtained from the consumers' using a good are

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we intend to use the heterogeneity in the economy implied by the market
 prices to understand how non-durable consumption quality relevant for social
 status may vary and segregate status competitions, we prefer a view of
 quality aggregated over a commodity to the item-wise view used in the Heien-Wes
sels approach.
 The aggregation into broader commodity groups - such as energy ot transport
 - also circumvents the issue of non-consumption since it is much less likely
 for no goods to be consumed within a commodity group (fruits-veg, protein
 etc.).
 No correction related to non-consumption - as used in the Heien-Wells method
 - is therefore required with the aggregation approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, while the Heien-Wells approach may be well-suited for comparison
 of elasticities for particular goods, the comparison of quality across
 multiple commodities which we seek for an overview of overall quality is
 better implemented with an AIDS method including demographic characteristics

In the empirical studies on demand, the separability of demand for commodities

 Even though the separability of consumer demand is not always verified
 empirically, the assumption of separability is nearly ubiquitous in the
 literature as it is one of the least intrusive assumptions one could make
 on the structure of demand in order for a high-level interpretation.
 The interpretations based on separable groups indeed facilitate the comparison
 with of current demand with the past and across the cross-section in the
 demand studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite their ubiquity in the demand literature, the discussion of separability
 seems largely absent from the literature of status consumption.
 This seems primarily because of the advantage offered by the futility assumptio
n i.e.
 the assumption that all visible goods serve no purpose other than signaling.
 While measuring the consumption of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conspicuous
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 goods, the demand elasticities are invariably estimated using a collection
 of visible/conspicuous goods as if they were a separate commodity group
 themselves.
 The separate group of conspicuous goods is justified with the assumption
 that conspicuous consumption has a zero-utility in the usual (private)
 sense (see Ireland model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and Hopkins et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for the details of this argument).
 The demand for the goods that are known to be visible 
\shape italic
a priori 
\shape default
is therefore also separable as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of the consumption diary microdata in the developing (largely
 agrarian) countries, we find the futility assumption somewhat limiting.
 This is because in such markets, a high-quality good (priced higher in
 the market than its substitutes) is conspicuous not solely on grounds of
 its visibility but its utility as well.
 When most people don't have access to electricity in an economy, then having
 electricity as opposed to kerosene can also provide a status benefit (even
 though electricity is not a status or visible good 
\shape italic
per se
\shape default
).
 Similarly, when most people take public-transport to work, having a car
 or taking a taxi also provides a status benefit and so on.
 Going beyond the idea of visible goods, the model draws no distinction
 between private as public/visible consumption.
 Because of how widespread the low-quality consumption may be, a good that
 is not so important from a visibility perspective (i.e.
 not futile) but has high quality may be relevant for status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surveying the overall high-quality without using the futility assumption,
 we cannot assume that the high quality goods from different commodity groups
 can be grouped together.
 Put another way, the set of high-quality goods within each of the commodities
 cannot together offer a utility in a manner the visible goods taken together
 do.
 Thus we attempt to gauge only how consumers put some weight on higher-quality
 within each commodity group without examining how overall quality may be
 budgeted for by the consumer within the non-overlapping commodity groups.
 Even though kobe beef cannot be substituted with luxury travel as such,
 the high standard of life indicated by either or both of them may not lead
 to a utility for quality separable across food and transport commodities.
 Therefore, no attempts are made to understand how consumers may purchase
 a desired amount of (overall) quality.
 The variation in high-quality consumption across the population is observed
 only as a vector of quality composed of quality metrics corresponding to
 each commodity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The econometric methods we use thus employ a vector of quality metrics
\begin_inset Foot

Notice that no quality-related inferences can be drawn without an explicit
 measure of quality in the utility.
 Consider for example the commonly used Stone-Geary utility for all commodity
 groups.
 The indirect utility function with the optimisation of Stone-Geary direct
 utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum\beta_{i}log(q_{i}+\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\beta_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 under the conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $u\equiv\psi(x,p)=\sum\beta_{i}log(x\beta_{i}/p_{i}+\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 This uses the first-order conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $L=u-\lambda(x-p\cdot q)=\sum\beta_{i}log(q_{i}+\gamma_{i})-\lambda(x-p\cdot q)$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}=0\Rightarrow\frac{\beta_{i}}{q_{i}}=\lambda p_{i}\forall i\in[1,n]$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}q_{i}}=\lambda\forall i\in[1,n]$

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}=\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}x$
\end_inset

 .
 As long we can assume that a consumer observes the price index of a commodity
 (rather than individual prices), the indirect utility does not differentiate
 between an increase in the price-index of the commodity (whose multiple
 variants are observed) and the switch to a better quality good by the consumer.
 This would be a serious issue in empirical analyses - in addition to the
 usual limitations of additive utility - when a higher quality is more expensive
 than less qualitt as the increase in the price-index of a good is not different
iated from the consumer reducing the quantity consumed of the item.
\end_layout

 for every commodity group i.e.
 a vector 
\begin_inset Formula ${\nu_{G\in\mathscr{{G}}}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is a commodity group 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 is the set of all commodities so that the representative consumer can prefer
 higher quality in one group 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{1}$
\end_inset

 over that in the another 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The quality metric in each group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is calculated using the local prices of the goods within that commodity.
 More simply put, a consumer who buys more of the high-priced good within
 a commodity group is viewed as consuming higher quality of that commodity.
 We then attempt to view both how the demand for quality is distributed
 across the population and how it varies in response to change in prices.
 The use of a commodity aggregate also imposes the restrictions of a constant
 relative price structure (i.e.
 the Hicks aggregation restriction - see Nelson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 For the quantities consumed for two (or more) goods within a commodity
 (e.g.
 tea and carbonated drinks under beverages that can be interchanged by the
 consumer), we use the aggregate-quantity of a composite good (i.e.
 beverages) along with the value consumed of a quality metric (proportion
 of tea and carbonated drinks).
 In other words, the quantity-price tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1},p_{1}),(q_{2},p_{2}),(q_{3},p_{3})...$
\end_inset

 within a commodity are expressed as a quantity and quality pair corresponding
 to commodity aggregate 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q_{G},P_{G}),(\nu_{G},p_{\nu_{G}})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G},Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 are prices and quantity consumed for a composite commodity while 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}$
\end_inset

 represents the quality of the commodity.
 Recall that an elementary commodity is one where no quality variation is
 supposed to exist and higher quality can be achieved only through more
 purchase of the commodity.
 A composite commodity - on other hand - is a commodity where a sufficient
 quality variation exists and a consumer can use a mix of higher quality
 and lower-quality goods within the commodity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To identify the commodities over which the quality measure is aggregated
 over, we make use of a simplication that not all variation in quality is
 considered of importance to the consumer optimising status and needs -
 the needs being interpreted as quantity of a commodity and status implied
 by the quality metric.
 Due to this simplification, the variation quality is ignored for a particular
 commodity category if the there are long-term assets that dominate the
 effect on status from the commodity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:AssetDomination"

\end_inset

Both quantity and quality in a commodity aggregate matter to the consumer
 iff there are no long-term assets associated with the aggregate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, having a car and hiring a limousine taxi in the transport commodity
 category may both carry some status benefit to the consumer.
 The assumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "assu:AssetDomination"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 implies a simplified context where only one of i) non-durable consumption
 and ii) long-term assets in the commodity group matter to the consumer.
 Therefore, in the tranport commodity group, only either of i) car ownership
 or ii) expensive-taxi-rides matter to the consumer.
 The implications of this assumption are not serious in the consumption
 data from Tanzania and permit us to focus on quality variation only for
 commodities where assets do not play a role.
 More specifically, out of the commodity aggregates - energy, transport
 household and those associated with food (fruits-vegetables, non-fresh
 goods etc.), quality is only considered for energy and food aggregates due
 the non-durable nature of their consumption.
 On the other hand, only total expenditure is considered of importance for
 non-durable consumption in transport and household categories (the elementary
 goods).
 This assumption stands only because most consumers in the data do not have
 significant consumption in the transport and household categories.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as one may classify every commodity group as either dominated by
 long-term asset or not, there are only two ways a consumer can spend on
 quality - either by switching between the variants of a composite commodity
 (choosing higher or lower quality of a composite commodity where long-term
 assets do not exist) or spending more on an elementary commodity (where
 long-term assets dominate and quality variation doesn't exist).
 In other words, both elementary consumption and composite commodity consumption
 compete for the consumer's money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the elasticities for commodity aggregates quality to make sense, the
 demand must follow the

 Let's say we observe the consumption on lamb and chicken within a protein

Econometric Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the response to price changes using the above formulation, we
 are also interested in the effect of consumer needs and other household
 characteristics in the cross-section.
 In the scope of the current chapter, the means of subsistence are considered
 the same for a wealthy and a destitute household and no distinction is
 drawn between the basic needs of a rich and a poor family (through their
 disparate educational needs etc.).
 The notion of status in the model comes only from the quality in non-durable
 consumption against the the long-term assets and permanent household characteri
stics for the consumer.
 Since the consumer cannot sacrifice needs in order to purchase quality
 (due to the very definition of needs), a rise in quality (for prices fixed)
 must come either from an increase in income or from change in circumstances.
 Likewise, a drop in quality must be due to change in circumstances (socio-econo
mic standing which we assess with a vector of occupation, education, region/loca
lity/neighborhood/assets) or addressing of more urgent needs.
 Here, a consumer having undergone changes in her long-term circumstances
 as a different consumer with different needs and/or long-term assets.
 Thus with changes such as purchase of a long-term asset of educational
 or occupational attainment, the consumer's long-term habits of non-durable
 consumption quality are permitted to change in the econometric model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quality metric defined in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 leads to an estimation of income and price elasticities (with respect to
 base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

) across a cross-section of household characteristics relevant for quality
 with an AIDS implementation.
 More particularly, we use the price-based quality and quantity for food
 sub-categories - protein (meat, fish), fruits-vegetables, non-fresh food
 items (dry carbohydrates such as rice, wheat), complements (tea, coffee
 etc.) and densefoods (dense energy providing food as buns, pasta, flours)
 while using an indicator variable for energy that specifies whether the
 consumer uses electricity or not.
 The prices shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The ownership of assets for transport and household which appears as the
 control variable in the AIDS regression is measured with the logarithm
 of the costs of the assets owned.
 The quality variation is ignored for transport and household expenditure
 categories and thus only the total expenditure is considered in the AIDS
 system of equations.

 is simply the minimum price of the goods within the commodity group.
 Here, only the locally observed market prices (at the district level) rather
 than the unit-values (estimated by averaging expenditure over a locality)
 for goods within a composite commodity aggregate are used for the base-price
 computation.
 The expenditure on household and transportation commodity groups - on the
 other hand - are treated as if they were (each) just one commodity i.e.
 elementary commodities with no quality differences observed in the non-durable
 consumption within the commodity group.
 The sum of expenditure clothing, soaps, cosmetics and other household goods
 appear as part of only expenditure (as budget shares 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{G}$
\end_inset

 As market -prices are not recorded for these goods in the survey, the CPI
 (base year 2010) for household goods and transportation as prices in the
 respective budget share regressions for household and transportation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above described aggregation is not without limitations due to the assumption
s of substitution within the commodity aggregates.
 The aggregation effectively assumes that a substitution between two goods
 is possible only if they belong to the same commodity group.
 While the two criteria we choose for the aggregation - i.e.
 the price-structure imposed due to the Hicks composite commodity theorem
 (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:QualityMeasure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and the functional criteria of separability - are not improper, any such
 assumption is a characteristic of the view adopted by the researcher rather
 than a claim on consumer's behaviour (see Nelson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for substantiation of this argument).
 Take for example, the protein commodity group - comprising of goat and
 beef.
 There is no reason to think that there is not enough substitution in the
 two goods or even that one is of higher quality than the other solely on
 grounds of a slightly higher price.
 Still a discussion of quality in protein aggregates may be relevant to
 the researcher when there are higher price and quality differences between
 substitutes e.g.
 if the protein group comprises of {pulses, chicken} instead and the consumer
 is meant to substitute within variants of protein.
 The grouping of commodity items depends on the particular assumptions made
 by the researcher.
 To address the concerns with aggregation, however, we also provide a comparison
 with the item-wised view of elasticities suggested by Heien-Wells
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeienWessellsAIDSCensored1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in Appendix III.
 The results from this item-wise approach provide a more detailed sense
 of elasticities that can be compared with results from our analysis using
 commodity aggregates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth recalling at this point why we haven't aggregated quality from
 across absolutely all the commodities in the manner of a two-state budgeting
 approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is ultimately due to there being no substitution among high-quality
 goods from across commodity groups - an assumption which we have made in
 the absence of the futility assumption.
 The possibility that a consumer could substitute high-quality in one commodity
 with that in another cannot be accommodated in the two-state budget model.
 More particularly, the rather stringent requirement of the two-state budgeting
 is the restriction that the relative demand between two goods in any two
 different categories must change only in response to the total expenditure
 i.e.
 the response to price changes and total expenditure changes must use the
 same channels of communication in the commodity tree
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer,StrotzUtilityTree1957"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 This condition cannot be guaranteed when there is a substitution of quality
 from across the commodity groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the issue with aggregating quality from across commodity groups
 in a two-state budgeting model with an example, consider a two-group world
 of food and energy - within which we have goods : beef-bread-milk and electrici
ty-kerosene-charcoal respectively.
 If consumers don't cut back on quality in one group to gain quality in
 another, the goods - food and energy - can be assumed (and tested empirically)
 to be separable groups.
 Therefore, it is plausible for a consumer to allocate some money 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy respectively in the first-stage (based on her knowledge
 of the price-indices for food and energy).
 Once the expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 are fixed, the (representative) consumer can subsequently decide in the
 second-state how much of kerosene or electricity to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and how much beef or bread to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Individual prices of every good within the category would decide which
 food varieties and which energy sources are to be purchased.
 Under the conditions of weak separability, it is implied that cheaper bread
 (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose
 a more expensive fuel (price-sensitivity for electricity, charcoal etc.
 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for details on the theory).
 This condition - however - falls apart if we introduce the substitution
 for quality across the commodity groups i.e.
 if we assume that a consumer gets quality utility from using electricity
 and from eating beef interchangeably, then having decided on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 does not guarantee that she would not switch to more consumption on electricity
 if kobe beef becomes cheaper.
 This can happen as long as overall quality is aggregated from across the
 commodity groups.
 Thus unlike in the case of energy and food without quality substitution
 across commodity-groups, cheaper food could be compensated with the switch
 to electricity - thereby violating the conditions of a two-state budgeting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sections that follow, we view how our measures of quality habits
 vary with the different levels asset ownership and other demographic household
 characteristics.
 The composite commodity groups for quality are: food, energy while the
 elementary commodity groups are household and transport.
 The quality of protein, densefoods etc.
 - treated as a composite good - are measured with the metric presented
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 while no quality variation is assumed for household and transport where
 only the cost of the goods consumed is considered.

With the recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, Tanzania
 serves as a case-study of consumer markets in the developing sub-Saharan
 Africa.
 In more recent times, since the investments from South Africa and Western
 countries have significantly expanded in the country, the trends of urbanisatio
n are evident in the consumption data.
 The data we use for our analysis is from the Living Standard Measurement
 Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World Bank - for years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 To understand where Tanzania fits in with respect to other republics in
 the region, we provide a brief historical overview of Tanzania, Nigeria,
 Angola and Kenya in Appendix I.

The LSMS survey records past expenditure with diary and recall methods.
 The diary method is used for food items while other purchases are recorded
 as weekly, monthly and yearly recalls.

 other expenditures.

The demographic variables from survey that we use in our a cross-sectional
 analysis are the language-spoken, current locality, place of origin, the
 education and occupational levels.
 While the income data is available in the survey, we use it only indirectly
 with a mapping of incomes on to the list of occupational (ordered) ranks.
 The assignment of occupation ranks from occupation field is shown in Table
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 There are two reasons why the income data is used indirectly in this manner.
 First, the income data is available for only around 30% of the households
 which we have diary data for.
 Second, due to the large informal sector in the country, having two jobs
 and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not uncommon and would
 lead to biases in the use of household income.

 education levels - is shown in Table

Before it may be used for measurement for quality, the consumption microdata
 from the survey years is normalised - merging the weekly data with yearly
 data by extrapolating the past week's consumption.
 The details of this process are described in Appendix II.
 Once normalised, the matching of market prices for the goods consumed by
 a household is done for quality in food and energy subgroups (see Assumption

 A functional category is one where there is a sufficient degree of substitution

 for a similar analysis of rice varieties).
 Here, the sub-groups within food are created based on the correlated changes
 in price from 2008 until 2014.
 For example, the price changes for sugar and tea are more similar to each
 other they are to the changes in prices for rice or cooking-oil.
 We therefore put sugar and tea within a group complements and rice-cooking_oil
 within a group nonfresh (to indicate the comovement of prices).
 Similarly, within the food commodity we observe protein, fruitsveg, densefoods
 and nonfresh groups as the rest of the food-subgroups.
 One of the advantages of using commodity aggregates in this manner is also
 that they avoid the measurement errors arising out of combining recall
 and diary goods

 When there are multiple price observations at the district level (through
 price capture at in more than one constituent wards or villages), then
 we arrive a district-level price using a regression over price records
 for the good in the district.
 The use of the regression for obtaining the market-prices at the district
 level also makes sense because prices are recorded in several units.
 By assimilating all the price data from across the quantities and regions
 in the regression, we use the coefficients to obtain the price for a unit-quant
ity of an good (kg,litres etc.).
 Here, as the unit-prices grow at a less than linear rate with quantity,
 we use a quadratic expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 to regress the observed marked-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 against the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 they're recorded in where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a constant .
 The price of any arbitrary quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}$
\end_inset

 of a good is thus simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{\underline{q}^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 and for the price of unit-quantity that we use for base-prices and relative
 price structures, the price is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

 ).

%What we need from the regression however, is merely the price of the unit-quant
ity (e.g.
 the price per kg for rice in the current example) rather than matching
 the appropriate marked price with the quantity purchased by the consumer.
 If we were to really look for a perfect match for prices, then we should
 not only match the quantities consumed by the consumer with the prices
 recorded in the market but also the time of the household interview with
 that of the price recorded.
 This fine matching is both impractical (survey prices being hardly available
 at such fine levels of granularity) and unnecessary since our view of price
 is that of a value that is faced by a sufficiently large number of consumers
 in the survey.

%One may argue that a selection bias is introduced when we use the national-aver
ages for some goods and region averages for other.
 This could be a problem if the unavailability of regional averages occurred
 for a significant portion of price entries.
 However, since only about  of the total price observations have no regional
 averages (only a few goods suffer with the issue), the bias thus introduced
 would be rather insignificant.
 Another issue could be taken with our grouping of commodities - as it relies
 on the annual time-series data.
 It is indeed possible that the price of some goods may be more volatile
 than the others - and thus the volatility being ignored in the annual time
 series data would bring some bias.
 But since we combine the household log diary with the recall diary (which
 is recorded on a monthly or yearly basis), a finer time-series for prices
 is not enough to address this issue.
 Such a bias could be alleviated only through finer price data and a uniformly
 collected household consumption microdata.

 themselves.
 The locally available prices show for example how consumers in rural districts
 are not exposed to prices of expensive urban items.
 Further, the variation in prices for certain items such as meat, seafood,
 energy sources or processed foods are higher than for the rest of the food
 items (see Figure

 These variations suggest a demand pressure for quality as well as a disparity

 fruits-veg, protein and complements (see Table

 for all the goods that belong to these commodity groups).
 Since quality measure is not used for energy, household and transport no
 quality equations are needed for these commodity.

 goods - their quality in particular.
 Further, the variable 
\family typewriter
expensive_region
\family default
 is significant overall for non-fresh quality, protein quality, household
 commodity group, transport commodity group and the energy commodity group.
 The consumer habits do seem to be influenced by the financial standing
 of the consumer indicated with both occupation rank and assets owned by
 the consumers.
 While those with more assets spend less on some food quality categories,
 they do spend more on the household-related non-durable consumption.
 With higher expenditure (

), the quality of non-fresh seems to increase but the quality of fruits-veg
 decreases.
 Apart from the relevance of

 Food is actually expensive and quality options higher in urban areas.

[has_elec] Of particular interest is the association of the quality of goods
 (indicated with variables starting with 
\family typewriter
qV
\family default
-) with whether the consumers use electricity or not.
 Those with a stronger long-term economic standing spend relatively less
 on quality of protein and transport (public_transport, car maintenance
 etc.) - commodities where those who have electricity seem to spend more.
 Having access to electricity has a considerable association with the quality
 of protein consumed for the average consumer (see the effect of the 
\family typewriter
has_electric
\family default
 variable in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT

) likely because of the relative affluence of regions where electricity
 is available.

\begin_layout Standard
Running another SUR with assets split into electrical, household and transport
 assets confirms the relevance of electric assets (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsSubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the consumption on energy is higher for electricity
 users due to the high prices of electricity in Tanzania but the owners
 of electrical assets also consume more fruits-veg quality and have more
 expenditure on household products (while a slightly lower fruitsveg quality
 is associated total expenditure

).

\begin_layout Standard
The above observations suggest the life-style differences in the densely
 populated urban areas brought about by availability of industrial goods.
 The urban consumers may have less overall assets compared to their counterparts
 in rural areas but they spend more on quality on protein and fruits-veg
 (less on dense-foods and household asset).

Robustness Checks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure that the relevance of high asset ownership (and electrical assets
 in particular) for differences of quality is a robust observation, we rerun
 the SUR with an aggregated food category.
 This formulation no longer uses the price-based groups and views all food-subca
tegories as one food group
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The quality is still calculated based on the prices.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 Using the CPI of food basket as prices (just the way transport CPI and
 household CPI are used) the above analysis is repeated with food, energy,
 transport and household as separable categories.
 In the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsFoodCPIAllAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsFoodCPISubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, a preference for higher quality for household asset owners is observed
 when we use a food aggregate (a collection of the subcategories).
 More specifically, the food quality increases with total expenditure and
 with acquisition of household assets.
 As one would expect, transport costs appear higher in the urban areas.
 The non-durable expenditure on household goods and overall food quality
 both decrease for urban areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a further test of the robustness of results, we calculate the food-quality
 using the market-provided prices.
 More specifically, the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{resultsAllassets}

 we have used diary-costs on goods as reported by the consumer.
 However, the LSMS records this cost only from the goods that were consumed
 from purchases in the last week.
 If a consumer didn't purchase anything in the past week, there would only
 be quantities consumed (not costs) that would be reported for the consumer
 in the diary.
 Since we have the market-prices available, another way to calculate costs,
 budget-shares and quality would be to infer costs as the multiple of market-pri
ces from the quantities consumed in the past week (which is reported for
 all consumers regardless of whether they had purchased something in the
 last week or not).
 Recalculating quality and budget shares still shows us the same economic
 and statistical significance (results available on request) of electricity
 and household assets in quality of fruitsveg, proteins and other subcategories.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The availability of market-prices and the details on household characteristics
 as well as owned assets allow us to understand the factors that may cause
 the differences in the consumer baskets (i.e.
 what we refer to as the supply-side concerns) and influence consumption
 of quality - whose role in status consumption we had set ourselves to explore
 in the current chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the differences in consumer baskets for the urban and rural consumer,
 it is not surprising that those in the urban areas spend differently on
 certain non-durable goods.
 Nevertheless, the sustained quality differences for meat and fresh goods
 for urban consumers indicate a peculiar environmental difference in the
 urban areas - particularly sensitive to the distribution of electricity
 and availability of public transport.
 We find that it is not just that those with higher asset worth tend to
 buy more - but the quality purchased for a few categories always appears
 higher (lower) for the consumers who own medium-cost assets and lower (higher)
 for consumers who don't - notwithstanding that fact that the consumers
 do not forgo food quality over non-food quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the urban areas, the households that don't own assets would benefit
 from spending more on industrial goods than an equivalent consumer in the
 rural area who does not face the same choice of industrial goods.
 In other words, those who own more assets in the rural may not face the
 status competitions the way the asset owning consumer in an urban area
 would.
 From the perspective of demand analysis, one can only observe if the consumer
 in the urban areas sacrifices quality in one group to avail it in another
 - a choice that the rural consumer does not have.
 What we may expect is that the pricier meats or electrical goods available
 to the urban food consumer may let her deprioritise the quality in other
 commodities.
 However, our observations indicate instead that the habits of urban and
 rural consumers as well as those of poor and rich within the urban areas
 are far apart from each other.
 What this mean for status competitions is an evident segregation of quality
 based on the long-term economic standing so that the rural consumer who
 has lower asset ownership and a disparate non-durable consumption cannot
 be in a status competition with the urban consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quality exhibited by the consumers with lower assets in the data thus
 indicates more of a segmentation rather than compensation for not having
 assets.
 In other words, the status competitions for the poor seem seem separated
 from that of the rich due to regional and economic barriers in Tanzania.
 The relatively higher consumption on household goods for those with better
 occupations thus indicates very little of evidence of pecuniary emulation
 in the data.
 We believe that such a possibility must be considered before we one begins
 to inspect the existence of status consumption in a developing economy.
 In an economy such as Tanzania, the suggestion that there may be a significant
 status consumption is difficult to justify in presence of such a segregation
 of qualities.

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The landscape of the political history of sub-Saharan African is dominated
 by anti-colonial movements in the past century.
 The nascent economies of the newly formed republics in the sub-Saharan
 Africa have not all uniformly followed path of the developed world.
 The industrial class in many sub-Saharan African countries is still poor
 in absolute terms.
 The administrative successes and stability of post-colonial governments
 are varied - often depending on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before.
 It would seem that the extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman
 or Moghul empires, for example, could be adapted well by European colonists
 in Asian countries when compared to the administrative units (much as the
 political boundaries themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The processes of decolonization starting in the late last century that
 have encompassed loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia and
 Africa have had mixed successes in the developing wold.
 More particularly, the post-colonial centralization attempts in late 20th
 century decades in both Asia and Africa have had a mixed levels of success.
 We provide an overview of the historical background of a few sub-Saharan
 African countries to summarise the similarities and peculiarities in the
 modern republics of the developing world.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Nigeria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The foremost observation pertaining to status competitions in Nigeria is
 that access to education is varied.
 This seems to be driven primarily due to the role of missionary education
 in Nigeria.
 In other words, the regional disparities in the current education levels
 across the northern and southern parts of Nigeria seems associated with
 the religious difference in the population.
 The north has had a higher Islamic influence while the South has been influence
d by Western Christianity.
 In the initial years of the republic, the market forces seemed to have
 had been left relatively untouched even though farming-based wage labour
 continued into the post-colonial era.
 The movements of African socialism in Nigeria were to limit power of merchant
 class further - contributing to difficulties in the formation of a strong
 base for small businesses in the economy.
 Therefore, despite the presence of quite a few multi-national corporations,
 the presence of a strong business sector stills appears hampered.
 The majority of these corporations being state-backed monopolies does not
 sufficiently assist the transformation of the the large informal sectors
 in the economy  into a a middle class with significant purchasing power
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 That said, the recent development in the economy may not have created a
 sufficient base for entrepreneurs, they have revived a focus on education
 and expanded the market for industrial goods.
 For example, an average of 42% workforce in Nigeria have secondary education
 or higher, upto 28% of those in mere survival activities have a secondary
 school certificate and 12% have post-secondary qualifications

 We believe therefore that the competitions for status may be hardly ruled
 out in the country.

Tanzania 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Given its engagement in the liberation movements in Mozambique in 1974 and
 the faith in planned economy inculcated by Nyrere, it would not be inaccurate
 to consider Tanzania the epicentre of the African socialism.
 However, once the political independence was achieved, the membership of
 nationalist parties declined and the separation of civil service from political
 institutions became less of a priority.
 The faith in socialist planning under the leadership of Nyrere meant that
 the reduction of private sector did not experience much opposition.
 However, inconsistencies were apparent in Tanzania's socialist model with
 insufficient support from workers and a ban on producer-consumer societies.
 The industrial sector seemed to have suffer because of import subsidies
 until many decades after the independence.
 The import substituting industrialization (ISI) led to often to oversubsidizing
 and adjustment to capital flows in order to provide for basic needs.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy combined with the capital-intensive technology
 meant high costs for economic development across sectors and resulted in
 subsequent decline of the industrial capacity utilization

 In its modern economy, it would not be an overstatement that the public
 officials have had an unfair advantage in becoming entrepreneurs.
 The problems around corruption also present limitations to the trade reforms
 in Tanzania (particularly in the energy sector)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The state regulated economy presents a disconnect between the parallel
 markets and a protectionist trade policy.
 The more recent participation of firms from South Africa and China also
 result in conflict among labour populations due to under development of
 training infrastructure within the economy.
 While the use of internet communications is higher in Tanzania than in
 Africa's average, the private's sector access to finance is low (albeit
 rising) and the size of informal sector substantial (60% of the labour
 market
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 The access to electricity is limited to about 10% of the population and
 the quality of life differs significantly between urban and rural regions.
 The status competitions in Tanzania seem to be influenced by these disparities.

 Similar to other post-colonial economies, the state-controlled companies

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock goods for consumption.
 The LSMS survey records the quantities for food goods - even if they were
 not purchased in the past week.
 But for other non-food goods (such as soap, skin creams whose quantities
 are not recorded in the survey) are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families as well.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption.
 To verify that this not a significant issue, we first test if such stocking
 (quantities purchased) may be uniform in all region in the country.
 We then test the significance of household factors that may affect long-term
 storage (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) of the purchased item.
 Observing the quantity purchased on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure on all goods 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we use a difference-in-means analysis to confirm the low effect of travel-cost
s on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{e}{x})$
\end_inset

 and conclude that stockpiling is not significant.
 It turns out that the number of family members is a far more significant
 factor for large purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wide categories of energy, transport and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.

% A lot of goods in the year 2008 were recorded with the unit as pieces/"idadi"
 (e.g.
 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis.
 These goods were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,

 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk goods where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the goods where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not

Implementation and Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step with the selection approach is a probit where the dependent
 variable is an indicator variable that is unity when the item is consumed
 and zero otherwise.
 The control variables used in the first-stage probit are the prices of
 the item and market-characteristics (region etc.
 - see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_probit"

\end_inset

) .
 The inverse-mills ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invmills"

\end_inset

 - see Heien-Wessells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) is then used as an instrument in the AIDS regressions(see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).
 The results thus obtained with a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) after
 imposing the constraints are presented in the Table

 The own-price and cross-price elasticities presented in the results provide
 us an overview of the demand across rare and commonly consumed goods.

 The other control variables starting with lp- are logarithm of price correspond
ing to every commodity in the second-stage AIDS regression (see Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

).
 The columns in the table (names starting with q) indicate the budget shares
 that are used as the dependent variables in the second-stage regression
 (see Equation

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above item-wise analysis suggests a split between the goods that are
 consumed in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant)
 against those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer
 are more readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education show that the goods available
 in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive elasticitie
s for income and education rank whereas the goods of agrarian production
 seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations huddled
 in the urban areas.
 Similarly, how consumers respond to changes in kerosene and electricity
 prices indicates the limited availability of industrial goods.
 A contrast between the goods that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this urban-rural
 split as well (demand for goods such as rice, beef is less sensitive to
 electricity than it is to kerosene).
 It isn't simply that the electricity consumers are more likely to consume
 the more expensive goods (due to their higher incomes) but that a certain
 goods become less relevant in the urban settings or are simply unavailable
 in the rural settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further, the signs of the coefficients suggest that mangoes (less
 consumed) and rice (commonly consumed) to be substitutes while fish appears
 as a complement to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.)
 rice.
 Similarly, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_f
lour]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens - while it is a substitute to bread
 and mangoes respectively.
 The substitution and complementarity thus observed are hardly an indicator
 of the overall quality since the reported cross-price elasticities do not
 consider the functional separation.
 More specifically, one cannot make much out of the cross-elasticities of
 kerosene with respect to buns or cassava unless without imposes strict
 separability assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or model restrictions (such as more buns would means less cooking in the
 household etc.).
 An aggregated view of the basket is thus preferred given our interest in
 the choice of quality exercised by the consumer when faced with multiple
 varieties of several qualities and price.
