\begin_layout Abstract

\bar under
Despite improvements in food security, many economies in sub-Saharan Africa
 struggle to provide sufficient nutritional quality to the consumers.
 Interpreting high-quality as higher weight of pricier items within a food
 commodity, we examine the variation in food quality and energy sources
 in Tanzania with respect food prices, consumer needs and long-term wealth.
 We find that food quality is aligned with access to electricity in Tanzania
 - suggesting that access to urban amenities significantly increases consumption
 of higher priced food variants in the economy

After accounting for income and the local price of commodities, does having

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variations in quality of consumption both across disparate regions in
 an economy and in local cross-sections of income have been of interest
 for studies in demand at least since 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerQuality1952,HouthakkerFamilySurvey"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The observation that the consumers may compromise on quality in response
 to income and prices while retaining a sense of overall quantity consumed
 has motivated the view of quality as a separate good by itself.
 Modeled for separate goods, the demand elasticities for quality and quantity
 help explain the consumer's response as increase or decrease in quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Models for consumption often subject non-durable and durable consumption
 to income and long-term characteristics of the consumers - who are meant
 to enhance their assets-stock as well as needs while availing higher quality
 over time.
 The proposed chapter attempts to understand within this framework, how
 the quality in non-durable consumption may be constrained by availing of
 certain assets in the context of a developing economy.
 We suggest also that extreme differences in terms of quality in non-durable
 consumption and assets ownership among consumers may overshadow the consumption
 on any overarching conspicuous-items in a developing economy

It is one of the reasons why the visibility surveys used in the literature
 are often adjusted to take into account the environment of wider inequalities
 of the developing world.

 that they associate with a certain

The current chapter focuses on the variation in quality of non-durable consumpti
on in Tanzania - which is a growing economy in the sub-Saharan Africa and
 serves as a case-study for the effect of disparities in assets and amenities
 in the region.
 We are interested in particular on the extent to which quality in non-durable
 consumption may be separated by long-term asset possessions.
 For the notion of quality, the current approach favours the observation
 of a price-based quality in food and the disparities in energy sources
 to the simple summing up of consumption on certain high-quality or visible
 items.
 The fundamental difference between the measures o
\bar default
f quality across commodities used in the current and the measures used for
 visible consumption(see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals,HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004,ChaiKaus2019,CharlesHurstRace,ZahraIndia"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is that the former does not benefit from an overall separable utility.
 More specifically, the assumption that visible goods are of no utility
 other than signaling means that the utility from visible consumption is
 also additively separable (see for example the models from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that attribute the futility assumption to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The empirical significance of the separation of visible utility is that
 the demand from multiple visible items can be aggregated across multiple
 commodity groups.
 For example, the utility from jewelry or luxury cars could be seen as one
 of visible significance - allowing us to consider the demand for visible
 goods as if they were a good separate from household necessities.
 The aggregate of high quality from across commodities - on the other hand
 - does not benefit from this assumption since quality across different
 commodities is both of private and public significance to the consumer.
 A substitution between all goods of higher quality cannot be argued for
 in the way one argues for substitution or aggregation among visible goods
 with no private utility.
 Thus, we consider the quality across identified commodity groups without
 aggregating them into an overall quality of a utility separable from items
 of low quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid any confusion in the terminology associated goods and quality,
 we stick to the nomenclature provided by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CramerIncomePrice1973"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

goods
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

items
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are variants with different quality that all fall under a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

commodity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CoxWohlgenant1986"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for further notes on this nomenclature).
 As explained, the quality across different commodity groups is treated
 separately instead of being combined into a notion of overall quality.
 The quality metric used in the analysis depends on the local market prices
 available for food and energy commodities (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 For food - which accounts for most of the consumption in the rural areas
 - the quality metric (due to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is calculated as the quantity consumed of high vs low-price variants of
 the food sub-categories (e.g.
 protein, starch etc.).
 Eggs and milk - for example are deemed of lower quality than goat and beef
 for proteins.
 These sub-categories within food are demarcated using the structure of
 the observed market prices and functional utility.
 More specifically, the food items are first sub-divided into groups having
 similar price structure and then grouped into broad functionality-based
 categories (e.g.
 protein, fat etc.).
 The partition into group of similar price-structure in the first step is
 due to the Hick's composite commodity theorem (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hicksvaluecapital1946,NelsonQualityQuantity,DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) which we elaborate in Section

\begin_layout Standard
Of the three commodity groups presented in our analyses - food, energy and
 household, we consider quality for only the commodity group where assets
 are of little significance.
 More specifically, the consumption quality differences among consumers
 through commodities such as household are more likely to be through owned
 assets (such as a refrigerator or a home theater) rather than the quality
 of household consumption (better toileteries).
 Thus, the variation in quality (not the quantity itself) is ignored for
 household commodity - which treated as an elementary commodity.
 On the other hand, the commodity groups - food and energy - are treated
 as composite commodities.
 The variation of quality in food is measured with the use of market prices
 (see details in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) while a variable indicating whether a household uses electricity or not
 is used to comment on the quality of the energy consumed (without measuring
 the quality of energy using market prices).
\end_layout

With an AIDS formulation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonMuellbauerAIDS"

\end_inset

 ) for the measures of quality for food and for quantity, the needs-units
 of the consumer and the permanent income measure appear as control variables
 in the regression while the quality-choices along with budget-shares appear
 as dependent variables.

 Here, the permanent income control uses the consumer's total expenditure
 (a commonly used measure in the literature - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019,KausSA,ZahraIndia,CharlesHurstRace"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and the needs-units of the consumer are represented as the number of family
 members adjusted by age.
 The empirical results find that the quality in food is significantly aligned
 with the access to urban amenities - electricity in particular.
 While the observation is an important one its own right, we use it also
 to suggest that the notion of status consumption is likely to be dominated
 by access to urban lifestyles in a developing economy.
 More particularly, if status differences are observed only through quality
 in non-durable consumption and durable goods, then no status consumption
 may be relevant across the populations separated by both long-term assets
 and quality in non-durable consumption.
 A consumer is unlikely be in a status competition if she lags far behind
 from its reference level both in terms of quality and asset-possession.

The analysis of quality elasticities has been of interest at least since

 Allowing the consumer utility to optimise both quality and quantity while
 treating quality as a separate good, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerQuality1952"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 decomposed the quality price elasticity of demand (quantity purchased)
 into a quantity price elasticity of expenditure on quality and an income
 elasticity of quality measure.
 The treatment of quality as a separate good has since been widely used
 in the literature.
 One such example is the simple repackaging method - which treats a high-quality
 good as multiples of the lower quality good(s) (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 More specifically, if the quality for a (composite) good is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and the base-price is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

, the repackaging method seeks an adjusted-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 so that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
x(p_{1}^{*},p_{2},...) & \equiv x(p_{1}^{1},p_{2},...,b)\label{eq:income_simple_repackaging_quality}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, the demand for goods with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 is viewed in terms of both the base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and the quality parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\{b_{1},b_{2},...\}$
\end_inset

).
 The implicit assumption in the repackaging approach is that the variants
 in every category are perfect substitutes.
 For most empirical studies where the variation in quality among the items
 within a commodity may be extreme, this is often a rather stringent requirement
 .
 A consumer switching from kerosene usage to electricity usage - despite
 the improvement in energy 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - may not be satisfactorily explained by viewing electricity consumption
 in terms of the quantity and price of kerosene consumed.
 Still, the simple-repackaging model is appropriate in the context of the
 cost-of-living index problem where a substitution is implied (see the classical
 application in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More recent approaches to measuring quality (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,AndalonGibsonSoda2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) have relied on the recorded quantities of goods consumed.
 After considering the local prices, higher quantities associated with the
 same expenditure should amount to a lower quality (and vice versa).
 Since the quantities consumed are less often available for non-food commodities
 in consumer surveys, these methods have been limited to the analysis for
 food quality.

The quantity-based approaches to food quality also suffer with the problem
 of unavailability of market prices - an issue that has only recently gathered
 attention (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 More specifically, the measurement of quality is often performed without
 the available market prices by simply averaging over the expenditures in
 a given region (or over the entire population of consumers).
 The so-called implicit price-deflator (or unit-value) method uses these
 averages in place of prices in the empirical analyses (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a recent implementation).
 While such price-deflators may be appropriate for certain empirical concerns,
 the measurement errors introduced by their are difficult to ignore for
 finer conclusions related to price and income elasticities.
 More specifically, the quantity consumed appearing both in the dependent
 variable (as budget share's numerator) and in the control variable (as
 the denominator for unit-value used as price) cannot be always mitigated
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As the market prices available in the survey prevent such measurements
 errors (see the discussion by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "McKelveyQuality2011"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "GibsonKimQualityBog2019"

), we prefer the use of market prices over price-deflator methods for the
 current study.
 The approaches such as the RDMP (

A quality-metric associated with a certain commodity (e.g.
 for protein or fat) depends on a grouping of items into commodities subject
 to a certain homegeneity restrictions.
 Given the quantity consumed

Such an aggregation requires that the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 groups (commodities) are separable and that the demand for items within
 each group is a homogenous function of the goods it contains (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

).
 The approach followed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - using the sum of physical quantities as measure of demand - puts the
 homogeneity restriction on the consumer preferences and assumes that the
 within-group preferences are homothetic.
 While this approach may be preferable in the absence of market-prices,
 the Hick's commodity theorem-based approach - which we adopt with the observed
 market-prices - does not require such an assumption on preferences and
 is subject only to a constant relative price-structure (observed in the
 market prices).

\begin_layout Standard
As argued by

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 do not use the homogenous commodities assumption and in fact permit heterogenei
ty in their use of sums of physical quantities as the measure of demand.
 Simply put, instead of adding the weight of chicken and eggs consumed into
 one commodity, the current approach considers chicken and eggs into one
 commodity only if the relative price structure for the two items (chicken
 and eggs) does not change.
 Our notion of quality thus relies on a price-weighted quantity (made possible
 due the availability of market prices) so that given the same expenditure,
 a lower quantity corresponds to a higher quality and vice versa (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Note that the quality measurement is relevant only for food and energy-
 which are viewed as composite commodities whereas the household category
 which also comprise of household assets are viewed as elementary commodities
 with no associated quality metric (see more details in Section

An advantage with the above approach - aggregating the quality over commodity
 groups - over the method that measures elasticities for individual items
 is that the former does not pose the issue of non-consumption of high-quality
 goods.
 More specifically, if one were to calculate the price elasticities for
 individual goods, an obvious issue that arises is that certain items (particula
rly those with high-quality) might not be consumed at all for a significant
 part of the consumer population.

 Further, the unit-values obtained from the consumers' using a good are
 used as prices for those who don't consume the good.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While HW approach may be well-suited for comparison of elasticities for
 particular goods (see Appendix III for empirical results using the approach),
 the comparison of quality across multiple commodities is a more appropriate
 interpretation for the overview of quality we seek in the current chapter.
 Since it is much less likely for no goods to be consumed within a broader
 commodity group (fruits-veg, protein etc.) over which the quality measure
 is calculated, the approach with quality aggregated over broader commodity
 groups also circumvents the issue of non-consumption.
 No correction related to non-consumption - as used in HW method - is therefore
 used with our approach that aggregates quality over groups classified with
 homogeneity restrictions (see Section

In the empirical studies on demand, the separability of demand for commodities
 that are grouped on the basis of their functional utility is often assumed.
 Even though the separability of consumer demand is not always verified
 empirically, the assumption of separability is nearly ubiquitous in the
 literature as it is one of the least intrusive assumptions one could make
 on the structure of demand.
 The high-level interpretations of consumption across separable groups facilitat
e a comparison of current demand with the past consumption as well as from
 across the cross-section - as it is often easier to talk about quality
 of a more generally observed commodity than of individual items that may
 vary across contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the ubiquity of separable groups in the demand literature, the issue
 of separability is sparingly discussed in the literature on conspicuous
 consumption.
 This seems in part due to the properties of the utility following the assumptio
n of futility of visible consumption.
 The assumption that all visible goods serve no purpose other than signaling,
 allows one to group the demand from visible goods as if it were from a
 single commodity-group.
 A within-group homogeneity through the futility assumption can thus be
 used to measure the consumption of conspicuous items as if they were a
 good apart from others.
 The argument that conspicuous consumption has a zero-utility is central
 to the idea of conspicuous consumption and is attributed to

In examining the overall high-quality without using the futility assumption,
 one cannot make the equivalent assumption and sum up overall quality from
 across high quality goods in all commodity groups.
 More specifically, the absence of the futility assumption prevents the
 homogeneity restriction across all high-quality items.
 Thus, our measurement of quality treats higher-quality within each commodity
 group separate from each other - where the commodity groups are demarcated
 using the homogeneity restrictions discussed in Section

Note that a two-state budgeting approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "false"

\end_inset

 cannot be used for quality due to the lack of substitution among high-quality
 goods from across commodity groups.
 More particularly, the requirement for the two-state budgeting approach
 is that the relative demand between two goods in any two different categories
 must change only in response to their total expenditure i.e.
 the response to price changes and total expenditure changes must use the
 same channels of communication in the commodity tree (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer,StrotzUtilityTree1957"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 This is a condition that fails with a substitution of quality from across
 commodity groups.
 Consider for example two-groups : food and energy which in turn consist
 of beef-bread-milk and electricity-kerosene-charcoal respectively.
 The two-state budgeting works with consumers allocating expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy in the first-stage while choosing expenditures on kerosene
 or electricity with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and on beef or bread with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

 in the second-stage.
 The weak separability of food and energy ensures that the cheaper bread
 (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose
 a more expensive fuel (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) - but the property is not guaranteed when instead of food , energy, the
 consumer selects quality  across commodity groups.
 If a consumer can substitute utility from quality in electricity with that
 form eating beef, then deciding on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 in the first-stage does not guarantee that the consumption of electricity
 would not change when the price of beef changes.

 that is aggregated over all commodities, we therefore inspect how quality
 in different commodity groups satisfying homogeneity restrictions varies
 across the population.

In simpler words, while having expensive dinners may be substituted with
 luxury travel for some (high-flying) consumers, our interpretation of high-qual
ity consumption is not so that a demand for higher quality of life can be
 aggregated across food commodities.
 Instead, the quality is treated as a vector associated with the set of
 commodities.
 Therefore, the econometric methods do not attempt to measure how consumers
 may be allocating money for a desired amount of overall quality.

 As long we can assume that a consumer observes the price index of a commodity

 ) which states that a group of goods behave as if they were a single commodity
 so long as the the prices of the group of goods changes in the same proportion.
 Simply put, a constant relative price structure allows us to factor out
 the quantity of the composite commodity consumed from the demand function
 for the variants (goods) within the commodity - allowing the price of quality
 to be interpreted in terms of a composite price

 Instead of viewing demands for {wheat, rice, corn, eggs, beef, chicken,
 fish, charcoal, kerosene, electricity} individually with a list of 10 functions
 for example, the above formulation allows us to view demands for commodities
 {carb, protein and energy} that encompass the 10 goods with just 3 respective
 functions corresponding to the 3 commodity groups.
 Other than the high-level categories of the commodities (protein, fat etc.),
 the key requirement for the validity of such a quality metric is that the
 prices of goods within the commodity group have a constant relative price-struc
ture i.e.
 a relative prices ratio that can be factored out of the observed prices
 (see

 for a similar analysis of rice varieties).
 The sub-groups within food are primarily based on the correlated changes
 in price (from 2008 until 2014) and are then split into functional groups.
 For example, the price changes for sugar and tea are similar to each other.
 The price changes for rice and cooking-oil are also similar to each other.
 We put sugar and tea within a group of complements because they have similar
 price changes as well as a similar functional sense.
 Despite rice being a starch item and cooking-oil being a fat item, we don't
 put them under starch or fat - categories for a functional sense.
 Instead we put rice and cooking_oil within the group nonfresh - driven
 by the comovement of prices.
 Other categories protein, fruitsveg and densefoods are similarly based
 foremost on price-movement correlations before considering a functional
 sense.

 A functional category is essentially one where there is a plausible substitutio
n.
 As an example, goat and beef may be put under the same group - but not
 with tea - as there is little sense in substitution between tea and meat.
 Using both the price-movement and functional sense, every commodity aggregate

 has goods that have the same functional significance

have a similar price-movement.

\begin_layout Standard
The identification the commodities over which the quality measure is to
 be aggregated over also makes use of a simplification that not all variation
 in quality is considered of importance to the consumer.
 In other words, both quantity and quality in a commodity aggregate matter
 to the consumer only if there are no long-term assets associated with the
 aggregate.
 Due to this simplification, the variation in quality is ignored for a particula
r commodity category if there are long-term assets that dominate the utility
 from consumption.
 For example, having a swimming pool in the house and purchasing pool membership
 may both provide similar utility to the consumer - the above simplification
 implies that only one of the i) non-durable consumption and ii) long-term
 assets in the commodity group dominate the consumer utility.
 Therefore, in the household commodity group, the quality improvement brought
 about by self-ownership of the pool is meant to be a lot higher than brought
 about by a swimming club membership.
 The implications of this assumption are far less serious in the consumption
 data from Tanzania where the non-durable expenditure on household commodity
 is dominated by the role of assets.
 Thus, out of the commodity aggregates - energy, household and those associated
 with food (fruits-vegetables, non-fresh goods etc.), quality is only considered
 for food aggregates (composite commodities) and energy (although only as
 a control indicating whether electricity is consumed or not) due the non-durabl
e nature of their consumption.
 Instead, only total expenditure is considered of importance for the non-durable
 consumption in household category (the elementary commodity).
 As long as one may classify every commodity group as either dominated by
 long-term asset or not, there are only two ways a consumer can spend on
 quality - either by switching between the variants of a composite commodity
 (choosing higher or lower quality of a composite commodity where long-term
 assets do not matter) or spending more on an elementary commodity (where
 long-term assets dominate and quality variation doesn't matter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that an elementary commodity is one where no quality variation is
 supposed to exist and higher quality can be achieved only through more
 purchases of the commodity.
 A composite commodity - on the other hand - is a commodity where a sufficient
 quality variation exists and a consumer can use a mix of higher quality
 and lower-quality goods within the commodity.
 The quality metric to be calculated thus applies only to the composite
 commodities.

 for the technical details of this argument).
 Since quality is to be priced in the market, a quality-adjusted quantity
 is a more appropriate formulation for the purpose where we consider a price-str
uctured weighted quantity as the quality-adjusted quantity and express the
 pair
\begin_inset Formula $\{(20,1.5).(10,2)\}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,5(=2\times1.5+1\times2))$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.43=\frac{5}{1.5+2})$
\end_inset

 .
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 is simply the minimum of 
\begin_inset Formula $20,10$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 and the price-structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is (2,1) for {lamb,chicken}.

\begin_layout Standard
We use the quality metric across commodity groups defined in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:QualityMeasure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 to measure how the demand for quality is distributed across the population
 and varies in response to prices, consumer needs and other household characteri
stics in the cross-section (a vector of occupation, education, region/locality/n
eighborhood/assets).
 A consumer having undergone changes in her long-term circumstances is treated
 the same as a consumer with different needs and/or long-term assets in
 the cross-section.

The income and price elasticities are calculated with the total-expenditure
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 and base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$

 using an AIDS implementation for food sub-categories - protein (meat, fish),
 fruits-vegetables, non-fresh food items (dry carbohydrates such as rice,
 wheat), complements (tea, coffee etc.) and densefoods (dense energy providing
 food as buns, pasta, flours).
 An indicator variable is used for energy - specifying whether the consumer
 uses electricity or not.
 The prices shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The ownership of assets for household which appears as the control variable
 in the AIDS regression is measured with the logarithm of the costs of the
 assets owned.
 As explained in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ClassificationGoods"

, the quality variation is ignored for household expenditure categories
 and thus only the total expenditure is considered in the AIDS system of

 the usual constraints of adding up, homogeneity and symmetry apply to the
 estimation.
 More specifically, the homogeneity conditions are imposed by setting the
 constraint for all 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_{1,Gj}=0$

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{2,Gj}=\gamma_{2,jG}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j,G$
\end_inset

.
 As is common in the AIDS estimation, the adding-up constraints are ensured
 by skipping the estimation of one of the commodities (in our case - the
 transport commodity) and setting its intercept to a the difference between
 unity and the sum of the rest of the intercepts i.e.
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\sum_{G}^{n}\rho_{1,G}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\sum_{G}^{n}\rho_{2,G}$

 respectively.

In the sections that follow, we view how our measures of quality habits
 vary with the permanent income and household characteristics.
 The composite commodity groups for quality are: food, energy while the
 elementary commodity group is the household commodity group.
 It is worth emphasising again that the quality of protein, densefoods etc.
 - treated as a composite good - are measured with the metric presented
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 while no quality variation is assumed for the household commodity where
 only the cost of the goods consumed is considered.

With the recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, Tanzania
 serves as a case-study of consumer markets in the developing sub-Saharan
 Africa.
 In more recent times, the investments from South Africa and Western countries
 have significantly expanded in the country and the trends of urbanisation
 are evident in the consumption data.
 The data we use for our analysis is from the Living Standard Measurement
 Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World Bank - for years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 To understand the political economy of Tanzania with respect to other republics
 in the region, we provide a brief historical overview of Tanzania, Nigeria,
 Angola and Kenya in Appendix I.

The LSMS survey records past expenditure with diary and recall methods.
 The diary method is used for food items while other purchases are recorded
 as weekly, monthly and yearly recalls.
 The expenditures on food are recorded with a greater level of detail than
 other expenditures.
 The summary statistics from the LSMS microdata for 2010 (base year) are

The demographic variables from survey that we use in our a cross-sectional
 analysis are the current locality, place of origin, the education and occupatio
nal levels.
 While the income data is available in the survey, we use it only indirectly
 with a mapping of incomes on to the list of occupational (ordered) ranks.
 More specifically, we sort the occupations based on the average income
 received before categorising them in broader ranks ranging form 1 to 3
 (non-paying occupations are unemployed status is set to 0).
 The assignment of occupation ranks from occupation field is shown in Table
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 The reason why we avoid using the income data more directly is that it
 is available for only around 30% of the households (which we have diary
 data for).
 The assignment of education rank - another ordered variable corresponding
 to different education levels - is shown in Table

Before it may be used for measurement for quality, the consumption microdata
 from the survey years is combined from across the recall and weekly diaries
 - merging the weekly data with yearly data by multiplying the past week's
 consumption into the number of weeks in the year.
 The details of this process are described in Appendix II.
 Once combined, the matching of market prices for the goods consumed by
 a household is done for food and energy subgroups

The absence of a good in the recall record for a household as the good is
 not to be interpreted as evidence of non-usage of the good.
 With the case of electricity, for example, the field for

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is more reliable for the test of electricity usage than the last expenditure
 on electricity.

 - so that the prices relevant for a consumer are marked as those that are
 available as market prices in the district where the consumer resides.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the market-observed prices in the survey are recorded at every district
 level or at finer levels, we match these prices with every household in
 the survey based on the district the household is located in.
 The only exception are goods such as electricity and gas that are limited
 to a few urban areas - the national price level is used

 As price observations at the district level are recorded in different quantitie
s (grams, kilograms for weight and liters, mls for fluids etc.), we infer
 the price at the district level using a regression over price records for
 the good in the district.
 By assimilating all the price data from across the quantities and regions
 in the regression, we use the coefficients to obtain the price for a unit-quant
ity of an good (kg,litres etc.).
 Here, as the unit-prices grow at a less than linear rate with quantity,
 we use a quadratic expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 to regress the observed marked-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 against the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 they're recorded in where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a constant .
 The price of any arbitrary quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}$
\end_inset

 of a good is thus simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{\underline{q}^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 and for the price of unit-quantity that we use for base-prices and relative
 price structures, the price is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

 ).

The values of assets owned by the consumer that we use as control variable(s)
 are obtained from the record of durable goods in the survey.
 The durable goods in the LSMS data range from short-term durable items
 such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such as land
 or housing.
 Of these, we are interested only in the transferable long-term owned assets
 that undergo changes in the survey years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 We verify the assets transferred over a generation by inspecting households
 in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit family starts
 a new household - treating the assets except land and house that are more
 expensive than the bed (furniture) as those that contribute to the long-term
 asset-values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$

\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

%What we need from the regression however, is merely the price of the unit-quant
ity (e.g.
 the price per kg for rice in the current example) rather than matching
 the appropriate marked price with the quantity purchased by the consumer.
 If we were to really look for a perfect match for prices, then we should
 not only match the quantities consumed by the consumer with the prices
 recorded in the market but also the time of the household interview with
 that of the price recorded.
 This fine matching is both impractical (survey prices being hardly available
 at such fine levels of granularity) and unnecessary since our view of price
 is that of a value that is faced by a sufficiently large number of consumers
 in the survey.

%One may argue that a selection bias is introduced when we use the national-aver
ages for some goods and region averages for other.
 This could be a problem if the unavailability of regional averages occurred
 for a significant portion of price entries.
 However, since only about  of the total price observations have no regional
 averages (only a few goods suffer with the issue), the bias thus introduced
 would be rather insignificant.
 Another issue could be taken with our grouping of commodities - as it relies
 on the annual time-series data.
 It is indeed possible that the price of some goods may be more volatile
 than the others - and thus the volatility being ignored in the annual time
 series data would bring some bias.
 But since we combine the household log diary with the recall diary (which
 is recorded on a monthly or yearly basis), a finer time-series for prices
 is not enough to address this issue.
 Such a bias could be alleviated only through finer price data and a uniformly
 collected household consumption microdata.

The goal of our empirical analysis has been to test whether asset-ownership
 differences influence the degree to which the consumer may spend on high-qualit
y in Tanzania.
 The aggregation (subject to restrictions) to the commodity allows us to
 survey the consumer choice for quality in high-level commodity groups (food,
 energy etc.) that vary with permanent income and other long-term household
 characteristics.
 We present the results from the AIDS formulation specified in Equations

Before discussing the results from estimation, we look at the market prices
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 (used in the classification of commodities as described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ClassificationGoods"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The disparities in the consumer market are evident from the market prices
 of the goods (variants) within the commodities (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mean_prices"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the box plots in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Recorded-prices"

\end_inset

).
 Some of the items - particularly the beverages and meat products - vary
 a lot in prices compared to items such as fresh vegetables and dense foods.
 The market-prices suggest that the rural districts are not exposed to the
 prices of expensive urban items.

\begin_layout Standard
To see if the disparity in food prices could be related with food deprivation
 in both urban and rural areas, we perform a non-parametric comparison of
 the fraction of households having run out of food (either due to lack of
 agricultural inputs or high prices) in the past year across urban and rural
 areas in Tanzania (see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionAgInp"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionHiCost"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 While this does suggest a significant number of households running out
 of food in urban areas (due to high costs), the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons).

\begin_layout Standard
Coming to the parametric analysis, the key control variable in AIDS regression
 is the permanent income measure.
 As is suggested by the standard consumption theory (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the total household expenditures are meant to be related with the household’s
 permanent income.
 The logarithm of the total expenditure 
\family typewriter
\size footnotesize
ln_tot_exp
\family default
\size default
 is thus used as the permanent income control in the analyses.
 The standard AIDS formulation considers the logarithm of all the prices
 as controls (see Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AIDS_quality_w"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AIDS_quality_lnV"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), therefore the logarithm of base-prices - inferred as the respective minima
 of local price in the commodity group - also serve as control variables.
 These are represented as the variables starting with the prefix 
\family typewriter
\size footnotesize
lp
\family default
\size default
- (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
lpdensefoods, lpnonfresh, lpprotein 
\family default
etc.).
 Recall that the base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 for every aggregate in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:base_price_structure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is simply the minimum price of the goods within the commodity group and
 that the base-price depends on the locally observed market prices (at the
 district level) rather than the unit-values (estimated by averaging expenditure
 over a locality) for goods within a composite commodity aggregate.
 Every composite commodity in the AIDS regression (see Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AIDS_quality_w"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AIDS_quality_lnV"

\end_inset

) corresponds to an 
\family typewriter

 variable.
 It is worth highlighting that the prices of other items in the commodity
 are incorporated in the price-structure considered in the evaluation of
 quality

\begin_layout Standard
To consider if the quality consumed is significantly different across urban-asse
t-ownership levels, we use two controls to study the effect of the ownership
 of electrical assets.
 The first control variable is the indicator variable 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
that specifies whether the household uses electricity or not.
 This is inferred from the field for source of energy for lighting in the
 survey.
 The results from the estimation using 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
as control are provided in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The second control variable uses the logarithm of value of electrical assets
 owned by household.
 The results from the second estimation are provided in Table

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both the set of results, the variable controlling for electricity usage
 is endogenous with the permanent income control 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
.
 We thus use the occupation and education ranks as instruments to resolve
 the endogeneity problem.
 Here, the educational rank of the consumer is an ordered variable inferred
 from the highest education level of the head of the household (see Table
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{education_rank_tnz}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 More specifically, the education rank is set to 1 for all pre-primary levels,
 to rank 2 for until the completion of primary education, to rank 3 for
 up to the secondary education level and to 4 for all higher education levels
 (higher-secondary, university etc.).
 For instance, the primary school leaving exam is taken at D7 in Tanzania
 and corresponds to the education rank 2 ; all standards above D7 correspond
 to the education rank 3 and so forth.
 The complete mapping is provided in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{education_rank_tnz}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the variable 
\family typewriter
occupation_rank
\family default
 is defined an ordered variable indicating an income-based rank inferred
 from the occupation of the head-household using the available income data
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is common for the empirical studies in sub-Saharan Africa to use the
 income data only indirectly.
 There are two mains reasons for this.
 First, the income-data is much more sparse than for occupation or education
 (only about a quarter of households, for example, have income data available
 in the LSMS survey for Tanzania).
 Second, the predominance of informal sectors further subjects the income
 data to significant measurement errors.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The occupation-rank mapping is shown in the Table
\series bold
 
\series default

\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{occupation_rank_tn}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The argument for using the occupation and education ranks as instruments
 is simply that a higher food quality in food is unlikely to be favoured
 by differences in occupations or education levels.
 In other words, while quality - in general - could be constrained due to
 occupational structures in the economy, there are few reasons to think
 that purchases of food could be influenced by one's occupation except through
 the permanent income measure.

 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 fruits-veg, protein and complements (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for all the goods that belong to these commodity groups).
 Since quality measure is not used for energy and household, no quality
 equations are needed for these commodity.

 suggest a significant relevance of ownership of assets - electric goods
 in particular - on the demand for quality in non-durable goods.
 While there is a some heteroskedasticity (using Breush-Pagan statistic)
 in the results, the effect of assets appears significant after taking into
 account the effect of permanent income (i.e.
 the logarithm of expenditure 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
) - whose economic significance is seen negative for quality in the results.
 The quality in food thus appears to fall for consumers as their incomes
 rise (in the cross-section) but it moves together with ownership of electrical
 items (or access to electricity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's not just that the access to higher food quality differentiates the
 urban asset-rich consumer from the poor and rural consumers, but the quality
 in energy seems to be associated specifically with the use (availability)
 of electricity.
 This is both due to the relative affluence of regions where electricity
 is available (see significance of 
\family typewriter
has_electric
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}

\end_inset

) and more directly (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_elecassets_2014}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) through possible improvements to quality brought about by ownership of
 electric assets (appliances).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As higher occupation-ranks (higher income) are concentrated in the eastern
 coast and centre of Tanzania, we also look at the effect of 
\family typewriter
isurban
\family default
 (apart from the base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

) on quality to find our if higher living-costs in a region may dominate
 the higher consumption of quality.
 The effects of 
\family typewriter
isurban
\family default
 suggest a higher quality for nearly all food sub-categories - and particularly
 for fresh-items and protein goods.
 The expenditure on energy is also generally higher for urban areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the effect of (base-)prices (variables 
\family typewriter
lp-
\family default
) on quality and quantity, we see with 
\family typewriter
lpprotein
\family default
 for example that the high base-price of protein (cheapest protein available
 in the district) corresponds to higher quality in fruits-veg- meaning that
 consumers in districts where base-price of protein (price of cheapest protein)
 is high also avail higher quality of fruits-veg.
 The quality in 
\family typewriter
fruitsveg
\family default
 drops - on the other hand - with rise in base-price of non-fresh goods
 
\family typewriter
lpnonfresh
\family default
.
 A pressure on consumer basket quality is evident - as we see larger families
 (
\family typewriter
hsize
\family default
) consuming higher quality (particularly in protein and fruits-veg) but
 showing lower quantity for food overall.
 The larger families have higher non-durable household consumption as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above observations suggest that the role of assets-ownership is significant
 in the quality of consumption for food as well as energy.
 With energy, the access to electricity creates clear differences in lifestyle
 choices and consumption but this effect remains significant for access
 to quality in nutrition as well.
 Even through the urban consumers may have less overall assets compared
 to their counterparts in rural areas, they seem to spend more on quality
 - particularly on protein and fruits-veg (compared to dense-foods and household
 asset).
 The effect of assets seems strong even after taking 
\family typewriter
isurban 
\family default
into account.
 Thus, even though there may be some positive externality with being in
 the urban areas, the differences in quality of consumption associated with
 high assets possession is significant.

\begin_layout Standard
As a test of the robustness of results, we calculate the food-quality using
 the market-provided prices and instead of the expenditure reported by the
 consumer.
 More specifically, in the results shown in Tables

, we have used diary-costs on goods as reported by the consumer - costs
 that are recorded by the LSMS for the goods that were consumed from purchases
 in the last week.
 If a consumer didn't purchase anything in the past week, there would only
 be quantities consumed (not costs) that would be reported for the consumer
 in the diary.
 Since we have the market-prices available, another way to calculate costs,
 budget-shares and quality would be to infer costs as the multiple of market-pri
ces from the quantities consumed in the past week (which is reported for
 all consumers regardless of whether they had purchased something in the
 last week or not).
 Recalculating quality and budget shares still shows us the same economic
 and statistical significance (results available on request) of electricity
 and household assets in quality of fruitsveg, proteins and other subcategories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The availability of market-prices and the details on household characteristics
 as well as owned assets allow us to understand the factors that may cause
 the differences in the consumer baskets and influence consumption of quality.
 Given the differences in consumer baskets for the urban and rural consumer,
 it is not surprising that those in the urban areas spend differently on
 certain non-durable goods - but the sustained quality differences for meat
 and fresh goods for urban consumers indicate a peculiar environmental differenc
e in urban areas with availability of electricity and industrial goods.
 In addition to permanent income measures, the possession of medium-cost
 electricity-related assets seems to have a significant influence on quality
 of consumption.
 The differences in lifestyles between urban and rural lifestyles - due
 in particular to the sparse availability of electricity - seem to dominate
 the consumption of quality - even while the overall long-term asset ownership
 is associated with the consumption of quality.

\bar under
We believe that the quality-view of consumption in Tanzania may also have
 some implications for status concerns in the economy.
 As such, few instances of status items availed at all income levels are
 seen in Tanzania.
 While the current chapter refrains from attempts to measure status consumption,
 it can hardly be ruled out that the contexts of developing economies drive
 status inferences to rely more heavily on observable quality and wealth
 differences.
 More particularly, when the poorer consumer lags extremely behind both
 in terms of quality in consumption and long-term assets, the differences
 in assets and quality may weigh in more significantly for any status concerns.
 In contrast with the more developed economies where basic needs of the
 consumers are fulfilled, the typical status-consumption in an industrial
 economy is ruled both in the underdeveloped rural settings of Tanzania
 and in the urban areas where widespread poverty persists.
 The narrow relevance of status consumption to a small rich minority may
 thus make the more general-quality view of consumption more relevant for
 developing economies such as Tanzania.

Historical background of sub-Saharan African economies

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The landscape of the political history of sub-Saharan African is dominated
 by anti-colonial movements of the past century - but the changes in the
 nascent economies of the newly formed republics in the sub-Saharan Africa
 have been hardly uniform.
 The industrial class in many sub-Saharan African countries is still poor
 in absolute terms.
 The administrative successes and stability of post-colonial governments
 are varied - depending often on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before in the economies.
 It would seem that the extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman
 or Moghul empires, for example, could be adapted well by European colonists
 in Asian countries when compared to the administrative units (much as the
 political boundaries themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The educational infrastructure created during early missionary activity
 and railway infrastructure left from mining activities also seem to have
 given some advantages to particular regions.
 The processes of decolonization starting in the late last century - encompassin
g loosely similar post-war political voices - have had mixed successes throughou
t the continent.
 A brief overview of the historical background of a few sub-Saharan African
 countries are presented below - highlighting the similarities and peculiarities
 of the current modern republics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Nigeria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A distinguishing feature of Nigeria's economy seems to be a differential
 access to education.
 The education levels across the northern and southern parts of Nigeria
 seem split also based on the religions affiliations - the north of the
 country has had a more significant Islamic influence whereas the South
 has been influenced by Western Christianity.
 The other important characteristic of the political economy has been the
 uncertain role played by market forces.
 In the initial years of the republic, the market forces might have had
 been left relatively untouched (even though farming-based wage labour continued
 into the post-colonial era), but the movements of African socialism seemed
 to have limited the power of merchant class.
 This seems partly responsible for some of the difficulties in the formation
 of a strong base for small businesses in the economy.
 Despite the presence of quite a few multi-national corporations in more
 recent decades, a strong business sector stills appears lacking in Nigeria.
 The majority of corporations being state-backed monopolies - has resulted
 in an insufficient momentum for the transformation of a large informal
 sector in the economy  into a middle class with significant purchasing
 power (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WilliamsGNigeria"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 That said, even though the recent developments may not have created a wide
 base for entrepreneurs, they have revived a focus on education and expanded
 the market for industrial goods.
 For example, an average of 42% workforce in Nigeria have secondary education
 or higher, upto 28% of those in mere survival activities have a secondary
 school certificate and 12% have post-secondary qualifications (see

Tanzania 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Given its engagement in the liberation movements in Mozambique in 1974 and
 the faith in planned economy inculcated by Nyrere, it would not be inaccurate
 to consider Tanzania the epicentre of African socialism.
 The membership of nationalist parties did - however - decline after the
 achievement of political independence.
 A side effect of this change was that the separation of civil service from
 political institutions became less important over time.
 The faith in socialist planning under the leadership of Nyrere meant that
 the reduction of private sector did not experience much opposition in the
 country.
 The inconsistencies were apparent early in Tanzania's socialist model with
 an insufficient support from workers and a ban on producer-consumer societies.
 The industrial sector seemed to also have suffered because of import subsidies
 that lasted for decades after the independence.
 The import substituting industrialization often led to oversubsidizing
 and adjustment to capital flows in order to provide for basic needs.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy combined with a capital-intensive technology
 resulted in high costs for economic development across sectors and a subsequent
 decline of the industrial capacity utilization (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LofchieTNZ"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 While entrepreneurship is important in its modern economy, the public officials
 often have an unfair advantage in becoming entrepreneurs.
 The problems around corruption also present limitations to the trade reforms
 (particularly in the energy sector - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LofchieTNZ"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Its state regulated economy shows signs of a disconnect of its parallel
 markets from the protectionist trade policy.
 While the use of internet communications is higher in Tanzania than in
 Africa's average, the private's sector access to finance is low (albeit
 rising) and the size of informal sector substantial (60% of the labour
 market - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WBBrief2009"

).
 Importantly, the access to electricity is limited to about 10% of the populatio
n and the quality of life differs significantly between urban and rural
 regions.

Angola
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having achieved independence from Portugal in 1975, the competition between
 different movements that were vying to lead Angola descended the country
 into a civil war.
 The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), a Marxist-oriented
 group that included urban intellectuals, nominally led the country (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CFRAngola"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Similar to other post-colonial economies, the state-controlled companies
 thrived in Angola.
 The state oil company Sonagol - for example - seemed to have played a quasi-fis
cal role.
 The economy's dependence on oil revenues have made economic diversification
 difficult (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 However, industrial goods have proliferated in modern Anglola and and stronger
 business ties with China have developed in the last decade.

Kenya
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The political power is influenced by many ethnicities in Kenya and policy
 changes often tend to be contested on ethnic lines.
 When resettlement was - for instance - attempted under Kenyatta's leadership,
 the discontent was strong and predominantly from the country's non-
\shape italic

\shape default
 population.
 Other attempts at nationalization - e.g.
 taking control of foods sales or establishment of purchase centres - have
 faced similar ethnic confrontations.
 Neither the socialist governments nor the growing private sector have been
 able to support the small-scale independent working-units in the economy
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "SchatzbergKenya"

 Much like other sub-Saharan African countries, differences between urban
 and rural life-styles seem extreme in Kenya.

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock goods for consumption.
 The LSMS survey records the quantities for food goods - even if they were
 not purchased in the past week.
 But for other non-food goods (such as soap, skin creams whose quantities
 are not recorded in the survey) are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families as well.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption.
 To verify that this not a significant issue, we first test if such stocking
 (quantities purchased) may be uniform in all region in the country.
 We then test the significance of household factors that may affect long-term
 storage (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) of the purchased item.
 Observing the quantity purchased on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure on all goods 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we use a difference-in-means analysis to confirm the low effect of travel-cost
s on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{e}{x})$
\end_inset

 and conclude that stockpiling is not significant.
 It turns out that the number of family members is a far more significant
 factor for large purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wide categories of energy and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.

% A lot of goods in the year 2008 were recorded with the unit as pieces/"idadi"
 (e.g.
 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis.
 These goods were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,
 pulses, peanuts, coconut, onion, greens, dried_canned_veg, banana_ripe,
 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk goods where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the goods where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not

Typically one uses the following formulation for 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(P)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
ln(P) & =\alpha_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}ln(p_{i})+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_{ij}ln(p_{i})ln(p_{j})

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But a simpler linear-AIDS formulation 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}ln(p_{ih})$
\end_inset

 is also often used (Stone's index).
 Notice that the inverse-mills instrument must also comply with the symmetry
 and homogeneity-restrictions and thus one must ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=0}^{n}\delta_{i}R_{ih}=0$
\end_inset

 in addition to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\alpha_{i}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\gamma_{ij}=0\forall j\in[1,n]$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}\beta_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{ij}=\gamma_{ji}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 choose a more general approach for the instrument variable by adding an
 equation to the system with term 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{i}R_{ih}$
\end_inset

 replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\delta_{i}R_{ih}$
\end_inset

so that the additivity condition is always met.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Implementation and Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step with the selection approach is a probit where the dependent
 variable is an indicator variable that is unity when the item is consumed
 and zero otherwise.
 The control variables used in the first-stage probit are the prices of
 the item and market-characteristics (region etc.
 - see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_probit"

\end_inset

) .
 The inverse-mills ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invmills"

\end_inset

 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeienWessellsAIDSCensored1990"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) is then used as an instrument in the AIDS regressions(see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).
 The results thus obtained with a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) after
 imposing the constraints are presented in the Table

 The own-price and cross-price elasticities presented in the results provide
 us an overview of the demand across rare and commonly consumed goods.

The main control variables are

 The other control variables starting with lp- are logarithm of price correspond
ing to every commodity in the second-stage AIDS regression (see Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

).
 The columns in the table (names starting with q) indicate the budget shares
 that are used as the dependent variables in the second-stage regression
 (see Equation

\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard
The above item-wise analysis suggests a split between the goods that are
 consumed in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant)
 against those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer
 are more readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education show that the goods available
 in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive elasticitie
s for income and education rank whereas the goods of agrarian production
 seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations huddled
 in the urban areas.
 Similarly, how consumers respond to changes in kerosene and electricity
 prices indicates the limited availability of industrial goods.
 A contrast between the goods that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this urban-rural
 split as well (demand for goods such as rice, beef is less sensitive to
 electricity than it is to kerosene).
 It isn't simply that the electricity consumers are more likely to consume
 the more expensive goods (due to their higher incomes) but that a certain
 goods become less relevant in the urban settings or are simply unavailable
 in the rural settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further, the signs of the coefficients suggest that mangoes (less
 consumed) and rice (commonly consumed) to be substitutes while fish appears
 as a complement to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.)
 rice.
 Similarly, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_f
lour]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens - while it is a substitute to bread
 and mangoes respectively.
 The substitution and complementarity thus observed are hardly an indicator
 of the overall quality since the reported cross-price elasticities do not
 consider the functional separation.
 More specifically, one cannot make much out of the cross-elasticities of
 kerosene with respect to buns or cassava unless without imposing strict
 separability assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "true"

\end_inset

 or model restrictions (such as more buns would means less cooking in the
 household etc.).
 An aggregated view of the basket is thus preferred given our interest in
 the choice of quality exercised by the consumer when faced with multiple
 varieties of several qualities and price.
