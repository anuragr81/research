Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models for demand analysis rely on exogenous price observations for the
 consumer's basket.
 The prices observed in the market embody both i) how the market, subject
 to supply pressures, evaluates the needs of the consumers and ii) how it
 prices the differences in quality variants of the same commodity to the
 consumer.
 Despite market-observed prices being of a central importance to the demand
 analysis, it is only recently that the detailed prices observed in the
 market are made available in micro-data surveys.
 Arguing that market prices are key to an understanding of quality, we enhance
 a typical demand analysis to include the quality variation within commodities,
 the needs faced by the consumer and other household characteristics such
 as income and social hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the analysis that follows, the needs of the consumers are proxied by
 the number of members (age-adjusted) in the household (and other available
 scales) while quality is measured as the portion of budget spent on high
 vs low-price items.
 With the AIDS formulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DeatonMuellbauerAIDS"

\end_inset

 for this simple model for quality, the scale of consumer needs appears
 as a control variable in the AIDS budget share equations whereas the quality-ch
oices appear as dependent variables in the equations (along with the budget
 shares for every commodity).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of the developing countries, we distinguish consumption of
 quality from conspicuous consumption.
 At least semantically speaking, the term conspicuous consumption encompasses
 only the exclusive consumption by the rich.
 We note that there are similarities between the current developments in
 Africa and the rapid economic developments in the United States of the
 late 19th century - given how the respective economies were set to transition
 from a vastly agrarian society to an industrialised one.
 However, we also take an issue with extending the concepts identified by
 Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

 into the developing markets.
 Firstly, in the environment of nascent economic growth which we observe
 in the sub-Saharan Africa, the options for conspicuous consumption are
 still limited to a very small part of the population.
 Secondly, due to the social fragmentation within the sub-Saharan Africa
 (see the historical note in Appendix ), the social context which the market
 forces operate within are not the same as that of the north America in
 its gilded age.
 We believe that quality consumption and possession of assets - which we
 focus on instead - are concerns for a much larger section of the population
 and contribute to consumer behaviour in a more comparable way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also tread carefully with the idea of status - which motivates conspicuous
 consumption.
 It being a complex social psychological phenomenon, deciding whether an
 item is a status good or not in the developing remains a difficult and
 almost always a subjective task.
 For example, if one were to rely only on whether an item can be afforded
 by the rich - then electricity, being used by a small and rich part of
 the population in a sub-Saharan African country like Tanzania, may appear
 to be a status good - at par with weddings (which are a clearer way of
 indicating status).
 However, whether the same amount of money spent on weddings enhances status
 more than when it's spent on electricity is a far more difficult question
 to answer.
 Similarly, one could argue that buying clothes indicates higher status
 and record consumption on clothes as conspicuous consumption.
 But without observing the effect that getting electricity in the house
 or moving to a bigger house may have on a consumer's long-term utility,
 we cannot assume a significant status-benefit to the consumer from expenditure
 on clothing - since the possibility that those spending on recently installed
 electricity or newly built housing may actually be cutting down on clothing
 expenditure while deriving status from electricity or house ownership cannot
 be ruled out.
 The literature on conspicuous consumption often proceeds with a snapshot
 consumer poll to obtain the appropriate classification.
 However, drawing inferences on long-term behaviour from such analyses still
 remains a challenge due to the cross-sectional nature of such surveys.
 Status goods are indeed hardly static - as the demand for newly introduced
 items - e.g.
 a smart-phone or a TV - changes quickly.
 The items of interest can therefore move from being a snob type to bandwagon
 type as the consumer incomes increase over time and the markets evolve
 to address consumer needs.
 We therefore motivate a dynamic model for status - as part of the consumer's
 long term utility - in order to generalise consumer behaviour from across
 the developing and developed countries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the inclusion of status in a long-term expected utility, it follows
 that the status that a consumer derives from consumption must come out
 of either elite non-durable consumption or high-priced durable consumption.
 Thus, tracking the two over time (i.e.
 high-quality consumption and the assets owned by the consumers observed
 over time) can help us explain status consumption with the help of a model
 for intertemporal choice under uncertainty over time.
 We therefore measure the extent to which the consumers consume quality
 (including any discrete choices that they make) given the assets they possess.
 Instead of attempting to find the criteria for separating status-items
 from bare-necessities, we focus on separating a consumer's short-term needs
 (i.e.
 quality or expensive non-durable consumption ENDC) from her long-term needs
 (inclusive of long-term durable goods - referred to as LTDG in the study
 and the longer term socio-economic standing formed with skills, occupation
 of the family etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Econometric methods are then suggested with quality and socio-economic standing
 as inputs.
 For the measurement of quality, we take a price-based view.
 Assuming that quality is priced in the market, the quality for a commodity
 is indicated by the prices of the variants of a commodity.
 For example, eggs and milk would be deemed of lower quality than goat and
 beef for proteins.
 Similarly for transport, bicycle would be of lower quality than car and
 so on.
 To measure the socio-economic standing of a consumer

The terms social capital - or status capital are also used in the literature
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, we consider a vector of income, education and region/locality/neighborhood
 as well as the long-term durable goods (LTDG) possessed by the consumer.
 This is similar to the use of socio-economic status (SES) indicators in
 the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While a typical demand study enhanced with quality metrics may allow us
 to explain differences in quality in consumer choice, it parametrises neither
 the discrete choices that a consumer faces on less available items (such
 as electricity in Tanzania) nor the substitution between assets purchased
 and quality demanded.
 In the current chapter, we have attempted to address the former by enhancing
 the AIDS formulation.
 A model for the latter - which requires a dynamic model for asset ownership
 and habit changes/inertia is explored in a later chapter.
 As we present a selection equation approach for the conventional AIDS formulati
on in the current chapter, we discuss the distribution of quality for food
 and non-food items before motivating a discrete choice model for uncertainty
 to model the gaps in quality and asset ownership that may arise out of
 long-standing inequalities in income, social inequalities or regional deprivati
on.

 carrying a notion of equivalence scales used by Houthakker.
 In the simple repackaging method, with the quality for a (composite) good
 parametrised as 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and its base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$

\begin_layout Standard
The base-price is chosen so that one can view the demand for items with

\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{2}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 in terms of the base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and the quality parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\{b_{1},b_{2},...\}$
\end_inset

).
 Here, an implicit assumption is that the variants in every category are
 perfect substitutes.
 With that assumption, setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 to be the quality indicator and 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\theta)$
\end_inset

 a function of the quality parameter, one can write the following in terms
 of a cost function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\tilde{c}(u,p_{1},p_{2},...,\theta) & =c(u,\frac{p_{1}}{h(\theta)},p_{2},...,1)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the idea of simple repackaging requires perfect substitution, its applicabili
ty to all commodity groups is somewhat limited.
 Consider for example, a consumer switching from kerosene usage to electricity
 usage - which is far more than an improvement of quality in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and makes the expression of electricity consumption in terms of the quantity
 and price of kerosene consumed somewhat of a stretch.
 To proceed, one may consider how using electricity would change the utility
 for food (with refrigerator), household consumption (hair-dryers) etc..
 The classical approach taken by Fisher and Shell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 recommends adjusting the prices of the final goods i.e.
 by decomposing utilities in a way that quality-change can be traced to
 all composite goods whose quality is affected by the particular commodity
 (e.g.
 electricity).
 This may sound rather cumbersome, but the issue can in fact be mitigated
 if there were a recursive tree-like hierarchy of the items such as refrigerator
s that improve the quality of other goods.
 With a tree-like structure, one needs to only look at the nodes of the
 trees i.e.
 adjust the price of all food items whose quality is improved.
 In addition to adjusting the price for energy, therefore one would also
 adjust the price for food.
 It is indeed possible to write separable utility functions for all such
 node items whose quality is enhanced.
 It is clear, however, that price-adjustment for electricity would need
 to go beyond the energy-commodity-group.
 Further, a detailed historical price information for all commodities in
 the context whose quality is changed due electricity for such a tree-structure
 to be set up would be required for an empirical analysis

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that we are concerned with the change in quality - rather than change
 in taste in the current study.
 Another way of stating this assumption is that all changes in tastes that
 are relevant to our study must arise out of a change in quality in one
 of the commodities.

While theoretical methods for demand have been refined over time, the empirical
 issue of unavailability of market prices (and thereby of quality) has probably
 not received the attention it deserved

 A methodology commonly used in demand studies for its robustness and simplicity
 is the AIDS model (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonMuellbauerAIDS"

\end_inset

) - which we adapt for quality purpose (see McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

).
 Based on PIGL approaches originally popularised by Barten
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, Gorman

\end_inset

 and Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerAggConsum"

\end_inset

, the method is simple to implement and yet readily conforms to the demand
 function restrictions.
 Still, AIDS implementations - like any other - are often ailed by the lack
 of observed market prices.
 An approach used quite often in empirical studies is to stick the implicit
 price-deflator (or unit-values) as prices in the AIDS regressions (see
 Tafere et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"

\end_inset

 for a recent implementation).
 While this may be the best way to proceed when market prices are not observed,
 their use can result in a severe measurement error since the quantities
 consumed by the consumer appear both in the dependent variable (as budget
 share's numerator) of the AIDS equations (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

) and in their control variables (as the denominator for unit-value used
 as price).
 Since observing market prices prevents such measurements errors (see the
 discussion by McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

 and Gibson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonKimQualityBog2019"

\end_inset

), we prefer their use for measuring the consumption of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of market prices in consumer surveys hardly makes the AIDS methodology
 less usable - just that the correction of such measurement errors is not
 always trivial (see Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities"

\end_inset

 for one such approach and McKelvey's assessment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

 of the Deaton method).
 AIDS method can be readily extended to other panel data scenarios.
 For example, the demographic variables in the AIDS model can be accommodated
 with the so-called demographic translation where the intercept 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\alpha_{i}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_{ij}ln(p_{jh})+\beta_{i}ln(\frac{x_{h}}{P})$
\end_inset

 is expanded as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\alpha_{i} & =\rho_{io}+\sum_{k=1}^{s}\rho_{ik}d_{k}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,n]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{k}$
\end_inset

 are the demographic variables (see Pollack and Wales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PollockWalesDemand"

\end_inset

).
 Similarly, the structural changes in the parameters over time is addressed
 with a dynamic AIDS formulation that is often based on differencing the
 budget shares over the time-periods (see Anderson and Blundell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersonBlundellAIDSTest1983,AndersonBlundellDynEqn1982"

 adjust AIDS to account for cases when there is no consumption on certain
 items - by incorporating an inverse Mills ratio into the AIDS regressions.
 This approach is particularly relevant for the analysis of quality since
 the consumption on high quality goods is often 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

truncated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a significant part of the population.
 This approach performs a first-stage probit where the dependent variable
 is an indicator variable - denoting whether the household

 Unfortunately, they are compelled to use the unit-values instead of (unavailabl

 unit-values (obtained from the consumers' using an item) as prices on to
 those who don't consume the item.
 This is needed because the price isn't available when the indicator variable
 is zero i.e.
 when the consumers don't consumer an item

Items of different quality exist: 
\series default
We start with the assumption that items of high-quality can exist in every
 category.
 As the categories are separable, these high quality items are not interchangeab
le.
 However, there may be a substitution amongst them if the consumer increases
 quality in one category and decreases in the other or equivalently, two
 consumers - otherwise equivalent - acquire habits of higher quality consumption
 in different categories.
 For example, kobe beef cannot be substituted with a luxury travel as is
 - but a high standard of life can be indicated by either or both of them.
 Due to the assumptions of separability and a substitution for quantities
 within the broad commodity groups of food, energy, transport etc., we do
 not attempt to view the consumption on a group of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high-quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items as a separate commodity group.
 This could be possible, if one were to assume that conspicuous consumption
 has zero-utility in the usual sense and is thus separable (as is assumed
 in much of the literature on conspicuous consumption).
 Instead of purchasing overall quality, we consider how consumers put some
 weight on higher-quality within each commodity group ( i.e.
 the portion of total expenditure spent on the expensive non-durable consumption
) based on their tastes and prices of higher quality in every category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Quality and its price: 
\series default
In empirical terms, we take a price-based view of quality.
 Thus a consumer who buys more of the high-priced item is viewed as consuming
 higher quality.
 This view allows us to see how the demand for quality is distributed across
 the population and varies in response to prices.
 Empirical studies often treat quality as if it were a regular item to be
 purchased in the market.
 As for any other item, therefore, the demand for quality must conform to
 the usual demand restrictions i.e.
 the conditions of homogeneity, adding up and non-negativity of the Slutsky
 matrix.
 Since we treat quality as if it were any other item, it is natural to ask
 if a consumer observes a price for quality and if so, should this price
 of quality appear in the econometric analysis.
 As we later explain, the price of quality can be represented as the price
 of a commodity aggregate along with the relative-price structure within
 the aggregate.
 The two implicitly determine what one may consider the price of quality.

 However, since a better quality item is set to be more expensive than the
 less quality item, a switch to higher quality by the consumer is inseparable
 in the from an increase in the price-index of the commodity (whose multiple
 variants are observed).
 The increase in the price-index of an item (regardless of whether it's

 Assuming that such a quality metric exists, there are a few properties
 it must have.
 If we consider an environment of stable prices i.e.
 if we ignore the effect of price changes for a moment, then the distribution
 of ENDC weights may change when the individuals acquire long-term durable
 goods and spend on their upkeep and maintenance costs or as they give up
 on hopes of acquiring costlier LTDG (possibly due to other needs).
 It is assumed that a consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality
 (there is little evidence of that in the data) - therefore when prices
 are stable, a rise in expensive nondurable consumption must come either
 from an increase in income or from depletion of savings (sale of long-term
 durable goods).
 Likewise, a drop in ENDC must be due to purchase of LTDG or addressing
 of more urgent needs or a drop in income (when price are considered stable).
 We assume that the rational consumers in our model hope to increase either
 LTDG ownership or ENDC at all times.

Price Sensitivity of Quality:

 In the environment of stable prices, the consumption patters may be influenced
 by long-term expectations - which we assess with a vector of occupation,
 education, region (locality, neighborhood) and LTDG.
 If we now turn to the effect of price changes, then we must consider the
 price of quality in the various groups and that the quality in one category
 may be substituted with quality in another.
 Such a substitution may not be perfect (as is required in a simple-repackaging
 approach) but a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport
 to food or vice versa - driven by change in prices, LTDG ownership or needs.
 To illustrate this substitution with an example, consider a middle-income
 family that cuts down on expenses (due to loss of income) by moving to
 a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants are
 fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place - so the consumption would either
 shift to purchasing a better car (LTDG) or improve quality in some other
 category (better jewelry, better schooling for kids etc.) - assuming the
 needs of the family (indicated by the number of family members haven't
 changed).
 In the case of the switch in the commodity group where a higher quality
 was preferred, the price of high quality (fine-dining) seemed too high
 for the food category
\begin_inset Foot

The difference between needs and status-needs is not a concern for our model
 - as the model only observes the differences between high-price and low-price
 consumption in the same group - assuming that the essential needs are independe

 The difference between needs and non-needs may seem critical to some for
 any study on status-related consumption.
 However, the issue is only a semantical one since our view of needs is
 only that of basis needs.
 Any non-essential needs are interpreted in terms of quality (ENDC) and
 assets (LTDG).

 In terms of the model, notice that the difference between the status of
 a rich and a poor family is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general status-need
 for the family to maintain quality across all categories - a task that
 is better afforded with higher income.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by expensive
 non-durable consumption and possession of LTDG in all commodity groups
 - driven by wealth and income of the consumer (rather than high-class or
 low-class needs of the consumer).

 to measure but for one to observe the quality substitution across multiple
 commodity groups, we would need a generic method for measuring quality
 across all commodity groups.
 This may further help determine how consumers switch between commodity

 and long-term needs (number of children, age etc.).
 Here, one can then measure how the quality substitution (the complementarity
 or supplementarity) between the commodity groups changes in response to
 the prices of the commodities.
 However, a key condition for the tree-like structure for the two-state
 budgeting model is that the relative demand between two items in any two
 different categories changes only as response to the total expenditure

 a two-group world of food and energy - within which we have items beef-bread-mi

 If consumers don't cut back on quality in one group to gain quality in
 another, the items - food and energy - can be assumed (and tested empirically)
 to be separable groups - since it is plausible for a consumer to allocate
 some money 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$

 on food and energy respectively in the first-stage (based on her knowledge
 of the price-indices for food and energy).
 Once the expenditures

 second-state how much of kerosene or electricity to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$

 and how much beef or bread to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$

 Individual prices of every item within the category would decide which
 food varieties and which energy sources are to be purchased.
 Under the conditions of weak separability, it is implied that cheaper bread
 (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose
 a more expensive fuel (price-sensitivity for electricity, charcoal etc.

 across commodity-groups, cheaper food can be compensated with the switch
 to electricity.
 If we have set ourselves to test the presence of such a substitution across
 commodity groups, we cannot assume that it simply doesn't exist.

 The first option assumes that durable goods influence quality consumption
 in every group while the latter introduces separability amongst owned durable

 If a consumer ought to balance the the overall quality with the LTDG ownership,
 the latter option is a particularly limiting one.
 With a preference to the former option and noticing the range of products

A strong distinction between the two types of commodity groups simplifies
 our model of consumer demand.
 With this condition, there are only two ways a consumer can spend on short-term
 consumption - either by switching between the variants of an item (choosing
 higher or lower quality of a composite good) or spending more on an elementary
 good (where quality variation doesn't exist).
 For example, since quality variation doesn't exist in transport and housing
 data in the Tanzanian survey, the consumer is assumed to spend on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

elementary
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 short-term consumption instead of saving for a LTDG (if the LTDG exist
 in a group).
 Another way to see this is that the elementary short-term consumption in
 the commodity groups where LTDG exist competes with the group where quality
 variation exists - for the consumer's money.
 The goal of the comparison of ENDC with LTDG is thus to compare the consumer's
 respective short-term needs and long-term needs.

One way to establish this equivalence is to interpret the quality in the

 Consider for example that with energy, such a gradient would be calculated
 with the price one has to pay to get more of electricity.
 Similarly, for food, this would be the price one has to pay to get more

  In a certain way, the price of composite quality can be viewed as exactly
 zero since the total expenditure is already accounted for in the composite

 If the quantities consumed were slightly different for another consumer

 It is easy to see that the quality is lower for the latter case even though
 the physical quantity is the same.
 The quality adjusted quantity accounts for the total expenditure and as
 such there is no price needed for the quality value calculated in the above
 fashion.
 Even though quality is treated as a separate good, the use of a quality-adjuste

 This is why our classification of items into commodity groups is driven

 Moreover, the quality within a commodity group can be aggregated only as
 long as the goods that the group comprises of can be ordered based on a

 For the meat commodity group, as an example, there may be no reason to
 think that goat is of higher quality than beef if the former is slightly

 However, quality differences are more plausible if the price differences
 are larger - e.g.
 with the choice of pulses over chicken under the protein category.

 though the quantity consumed is limited by needs.
 An analysis of the cross-price effects i.e.
 the effect of prices of non-food items on food quality and vice versa can
 help us understand this substitution.
 The data on possession of assets can also indicate the differences in the
 quality tastes in the different asset ownership bands.
 With a comparison of changes in asset ownership over time and across several
 household-characteristics, one can comment on whether the consumers sustain
 the quality consumption patterns relative to stock purchases (LTDG) or
 not.
 This would be explored in the subsequent chapters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Tanzanian data, where we identify the commodity groups - food, energy,
 household and transport, it's only food and energy where only quality matters
 (the saving for future is ruled out with non-durable consumption).
 Further, food is the only group where we have quantity consumed recorded
 - and thus the quality of protein, carbohydrates, beverages etc.
 - each of which is treated as a composite good - is easy to determine.
 We treat household and transport, on the other hand, as elementary goods
 (i.e.
 no quality variation is assumed).
 Thus we can measure the overall quality (or other short-term consumption)
 in comparison with the LTDG in an environment where new goods are supplied
 and the expectations for future income growth change over time.

Comparison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now provide a comparison of two variants of the AIDS model used for measuring
 quality elasticities in the literature.
 We assess their relevance, shortcomings before suggesting an adaption to
 our goals.
 In the first variant, an detailed item-wise analysis of cross-price elasticitie
s is provided (Heien-Wessells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeienWessellsAIDSCensored1990"

\end_inset

).
 The second AIDS variant (McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

) uses the measure of quality (as defined above) - except for electricity
 (which is simply an indicator variable).
 Asset ownership metrics also appear as indicator variables in the latter
 variant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the end we argue in favour of discrete methods - which we believe would
 make more sense in the status consumption contexts where the ownership
 of long-term durable goods needs to be considered.
 A cross-section analysis of quality and assets purchased is thus provided
 to motivate the need for a discrete modeling of choice.

A selection approach to item-wise AIDS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first AIDS variant uses non-consumption corrected estimates of demand
 elasticities to explain the effect of prices and household income on the
 demand for every item.
 The first part of this method is a selection step - needed to account for
 the non-consumption of a certain items.
 In the second part, a pooled static-AIDS method as described above (see
 Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_probit"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

) is used on the consumption microdata from 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-part i.e.
 selection is a probit that provides refinement to the second-part item-wise
 AIDS (which would have been appropriate in a more homogeneous dataset with
 less instances of non-consumption for items).
 The dependent variable in the probit is an indicator variable which is
 unity when the item is consumed and zero otherwise.
 The inverse-imlls ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invmills"

\end_inset

 - see Heien-Wessells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeienWessellsAIDSCensored1990"

\end_inset

) is in turn used as an instrument in the AIDS SUR regressions of the second
 part (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation
 (see Appendix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).
 The results thus obtained with a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) after
 imposing the constraints are presented in the Appendix.
 The own-price and cross-price elasticities in the results provide us an
 overview of the demand across rare and commonly consumed items.
 We base on interpretation on both the statistical significance (value of
 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

) and the economic significance (i.e.
 the size of the coefficient).
 Observing the signs of the coefficients, we see that mangoes (less consumed)
 and rice (commonly consumed) are substitutes while fish is a complement
 to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.) rice.
 Further, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_flo
ur]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens but a substitute to bread and mangoes.

An LA-AIDS model for Aggregate Quality 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the AIDS equations used for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unrestricted method
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we measure quality as described with the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:quality_def"

\end_inset

 (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Analysis"

\end_inset

).
 These AIDS equations used are evidently fewer than those in the item-wise
 censored model of the first AIDS variant.
 This is because every commodity aggregate - comprising of several items
 - corresponds to one aggregate quantity/budget equation and a quality metric
 corresponding to the commodity aggregate.
 The aggregation also circumvents the issue of non-consumption since it
 is much less likely for no items to be consumed within a functional commodity
 group (fruits-veg, starch, protein etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that while such an AIDS formulation does not model the intertemporal
 substitution, the condition C1 allows us to compare the quality variation
 in certain commodity groups with the durable good possession in others
 (Recall also that we rule out the use of a two-state budgeting model since
 a substitution exists between commodity groups due to this very condition).
 The commodity groups used for our analyses are food, energy, household
 and transportation.
 We use the CPI for housing and transportation since the expenditure on
 them is considered elementary consumption (these are categories where assets/LT
DG are deemed more important).
 In other words, no quality differences are observed in consumption on household
 items (toilet rolls, clothing etc.) or transportation.
 The expenditure on housing and transportation are treated as if they were
 (each) just one commodity whereas different variants of proteins and starches
 (i.e.
 goods) are considered.

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Tanzania is the first country to be analysed in the study.
 With recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, the country
 provides a much desired snapshot of the consumer world of developing sub-Sahara
n Africa.
 The data chosen for the preliminary analysis is from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) conducted by the World Bank.
 LSMS includes expenditure microdata from about 10,000 households - with
 many of the expenditure categories of potential status significance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Tanzanian LSMS data is richer for the food expenditure - which is recorded
 with a greater level of detail than other expenditures.
 As market prices are recorded for food items, we check how the higher budget
 shares are associated with choice of higher price items(see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mean_prices"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mean_budget_shares"

\end_inset

) .
 We find that the consumption of highest prices items doesn't always result
 in higher budget shares.
 Tea and coffee don't form the highest budget shares (while they are expensive).
 Items that are of high price and have low budget shares while having cheaper
 substitutes in the market qualify for the expensive non-durable consumption
 criteria for quality.
 Other descriptive statistics measure, e.g.
 the skewnesss of total expenditure on the item can also hint whether only
 a small proportion of population gets to spend more on the item.
 Noticeably, the budget share on skin-cream etc.
 - which we may have normally associated with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption - is quite low.
 The variance on the consumption of skin-cream is in fact lower than that
 for bread or milk.
 The budget shares for cigarettes seem quite high (and quite skewed) - however,
 since there are no cheaper substitutes available we don't consider cigarettes
 as part of status consumption.
 Although the descriptive statistics seem to confirm the heuristic that
 amongst many substitutable items, the distribution of expensive varieties
 is more likely to be skewed, it is worth emphasising that neither skewness
 nor mean-cost is used as a criteria to pick items for status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The substitution between items drives our classification of food item -
 goat and meat are put under the same group - but not tea and coffee - because
 there is little sense in substitution between tea/coffee and goat/meat.
 The food category is in fact divided into sub-categories so that demands
 within the category can be considered separable but still lump together
 the substitutes that are of value for quality.
 Instead of having to put tea,coffee with goat,beef in high-price food categorie
s for quality, we consider put consider the high quality consumption in
 the sub-categories beverages and protein.
 Similarly, instead of classifying beef, pork and goat as varieties of meat,
 we group them together with milk products, lentils and eggs as sources
 of protein - since we view the latter as cheaper sources of protein.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recall method is particularly volatile in developing countries where
 regular payment setups are hardly a norm.
 We must be careful therefore with interpreting differences in the budget
 share over snapshots (2008,2010 and 2012) for a particular household -
 as the household may not have expenditures in all three instances of the
 survey.
 For cases such as electricity in Tanzania, we find the survey field for
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main lighting fuel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 more reliable for the test of electricity consumption than the last expenditure
 on electricity (note that kerosene is much cheaper than electricity in
 Tanzania).
 Such matters can be made worse in cases of expenditure where seasonality
 (time of the year) is also an important factor.
 To address the issue, therefore, we are careful not to draw any conclusions
 from a household's expenditure over the time-series (i.e.
 survey snapshots in 2008, 2010 and 2012) - but rely only on the average
 expenditure by a collection of households (in a particular region etc.)
 over time.

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step

\end_inset

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantl
y.
 One way to adjust the quantity consumed is by estimating the storage using
 the number of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of rooms as such.
 Another way to test for store-and-consumption pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs - which could be because the market as described
 in the survey is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate
 region).
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we observe the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Since the store-and-consume habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

, it influences both influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

 and is endogenous.
 A reasonable assumption we make is that the percentage of stockpilers does
 not change significantly with the regions.
 In any two regions A and B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively therefore, we would have
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reason to believe
 that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 In this analysis, region dummies only appear significant for more populous
 regions and the effect of household-size dominates even if we resample
 the data in smaller samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travel-costs on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that stockpili
ng is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods.

For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen

 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the

The prices observed in the market drive our measure of quality and the later

 Since we don't use price-deflators in our analysis (due the measurement
 errors that arise with quantity being in both in the denominator of the
 control variables and in the numerator of the dependent variable), a matching
 of prices of the items observed in the market (identified by region and
 district) with the prices of the items purchased by the consumer (with
 known region and district) is of key importance to our analysis.

 (e.g.
 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis

 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.

 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year

While a household in the LSMS consumption data is identified down to the
 village and enumeration area level - we do not expect the surveys to record
 market-prices at every possible enumeration area and village.
 We thus associate a district level price to a household's consumed item.
 In other words, the price of an item consumed by a household is linked
 to all households in the same district where the household is located.
 We make no attempts to arrive at a price granularity lower than that of
 a district.
 When there are multiple price observations at the district level, we arrive
 a district-level price using a regression (discussed below).
 Further, when the prices are not available at the district levels, we use
 the regional averages (i.e.
 the next level of granularity available).
 For items such as electricity and gas that are limited to a few urban areas,
 we simply use the price at a national level

\begin_layout Standard
We now describe the regression of marked-price against quantity that we
 use to assimilate the price data from the survey.
 To explain this regression, let's consider an example of the marked prices
 of rice (let's say) for 1 kg, 2kg, 5kg and 10kg in the market.
 A typical set of marked prices could be 4£, 7.5£, 18£ and 35£ respectively
 - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

 for the plot of these example prices.
 As is often the case, such unit-prices grow at a less than linear rate
 as is shown in the plot of the unit-price corresponding to the quantities
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:unitprice"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore a linear regression of 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 is the marked price of the item and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 the quantity consumed) is hardly appropriate.
 The goal of the regression is to arrive at the price of unit-quantity (e.g.
 the price per kg for rice in the current example) rather than matching
 the appropriate marked price with the quantity purchased by the consumer
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we were to really look for a perfect match for prices, then we should
 not only match the quantities consumed by the consumer with the prices
 recorded in the market but also the time of the household interview with
 that of the price recorded.
 Not only is this fine matching somewhat impractical ( survey prices are
 hardly available at such fine levels of granularity ), it is largely unnecessar
y since our view of price is that of a value that is faced by a sufficiently
 large number of consumers in the survey.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The regression we use therefore is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 (assuming that the marked price is lower than a linear increase - see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

 - by a factor that itself decreases with increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $mp=aq-b/q$
\end_inset

).
 Since we use the price set 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

, the price to be used is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 for the regression: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta/q^{2}+c$
\end_inset

.
 The regression is run only when more than two prices are available.
 When the regression can't be used a simple median is used as the price
 for such cases
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This does not happen as frequently as one may imagine.
 For 2010, only 9 identified regions for just 6 items have less than three
 marked-prices available.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The price-inference is therefore a 2-stage process - we first obtain prices
 for every district with the regression method.
 If there are no marked prices available in a district, we use the regional
 value of the price.
 For some items, the region-prices are not available for some regions.
 Here, the price from obtained by the regressions over the country is used
 for the item.
 The prices for some items whose consumption is relatively rare in the diary
 data (e.g.
 wild-birds and honey) are not available for any of the regions.
 These items are ignored for the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the prices we obtain after the regression, we match the price for every
 commodity consumed by the household based on the district it is located
 in.
 The next step is to define commodity groups based on the observed price-structu
re.
 We use a broad classification of items for separability assumption to hold.
 Within foods we observe protein, fruits, dense-foods, complements and non-fresh
 groups and within energy, we put kerosene and electricity under the same
 group (energy).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can argue that a selection bias is introduced when we use the national-avera
ges for some items and region averages for other.
 This could be a problem if the unavailability of regional averages occurred
 for a significant portion of price entries.
 However, since only about 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim4\%$
\end_inset

 of the total price observations have no regional averages, the bias thus
 introduced would be rather insignificant.
 Another issue could be taken with our grouping of commodities - as it relies
 on the annual time-series data.
 It is indeed possible that the price of some items may be more volatile
 than the others - and thus the volatility being ignored in the annual time
 series data would bring some bias.
 However, since we combine the household log diary with the recall diary
 (which is recorded on a monthly or yearly basis), a finer time-series for
 prices is not enough to address this issue.
 Such a bias can be alleviated only through finer price data

A selection approach to item-wise AIDS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The item-wise analysis suggests a split between the items that are consumed
 in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant) against
 those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer are more
 readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education also show that the items
 available in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive
 elasticities for income and education rank whereas the items of agrarian
 production seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations
 huddled in the urban areas.
 While many of such insights could be offered with a simpler cross-sectional
 analysis using a regression of expenditure on the item against the permanent-in
come or total expenditure by the household etc.
 (an approach that is followed in much of the literature on conspicuous
 consumption
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,KausSA,CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

), the censored AIDS formulation was favoured due to two reasons - first
 it allows us to understand the cross-price effects in a more robust framework
 and second, it accounts for the non-consumption of items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further with the cross-elasticities analyses, a comparison of how
 consumers respond to changes in kerosene and electricity prices further
 confirms the concentrated availability of industrial items.
 A contrast between the items that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this split
 - since the demand for items such as rice, beef is less sensitive to electricit
y than it is to kerosene.
 That is to say, it isn't simply that the electricity consumers are more
 likely to consume the more expensive items (due to their higher incomes)
 but that a certain items become less relevant in the urban settings or
 are simply unavailable in the rural settings.
 This segregation of contexts cannot be ignored in a discussion of status-relate
d consumption in the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the detailed analyses that the cross-elasticities can provide, there
 are limitations to an item-wise approach.
 First, the detailed cross-elasticities are more likely to fluctuate over
 time and would require us to use a dynamic approach to ascertain model
 stability (an inertia or myopia in choices can be maintained to address
 this).
 Second, and more importantly, the cross-price elasticities fail to model
 the functional separation in consumption e.g.
 the lack of substitutability between energy and food items.
 For example, the cross-elasticities of kerosene with respect to buns or
 cassava cannot be interpreted unless one imposes other assumptions on the
 closely observed consumption patterns (e.g.
 more buns would means less cooking in the household etc.) or stricter separabili
ty assumptions (see Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonUnderstandingConsumption"

\end_inset

 for a discussion on the need to impose such structures).
 Since we are concerned with the choice of quality exercised by the consumer
 when faced with multiple varieties of several qualities and price, an aggregate
d view of the basket seems more appropriate.
 Such an aggregation ought to be based on a well-defined criteria - which
 for our current approach is the price of the items.
 The availability of price information between the years 2008 and 2014 prevents
 the problems that could be faced by other grouping criteria - such as visibilit
y (used in much of the literature on conspicuous consumption) - the changes
 to which are not observed over a sufficiently long period of time.

An LA-AIDS model for Aggregate Quality 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregated view does add the functional view to the consumer choice
 that is not available in an item-wise approach.
 Observing consumption at a higher level e.g.
 with separability assumptions facilitates the interpretation of cross-price
 effects.
 Whenever aggregation is possible (subject to restrictions), it allows us
 to interpret the consumer choice for quality - while representing the substitut
ion between broader categories and the price variants within the commodities
 in the econometric model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the aggregation provides an intermediate step to merging the data
 from recall and diary methods.
 As items are often recorded with more details for the diary items than
 for the recall items (the types of phones, clothes purchased by the consumers
 are hardly recorded in the surveys for example), the merging or data from
 recall and diary methods is rendered inappropriate.
 An aggregation can represent the diary data at a coarser granularity -
 which can be matched with that of the recall method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
===
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The price-based aggregation in the second AIDS variant - which we have adapted
 to our requirements - allows us to have a discussion on quality that was
 somewhat adhoc with an item-wise approach of the first variant.
 The inclusion of assets and the expenditure data from recall methods on
 household-transportation further helps us explain how the expenditure on
 quality may change within the population.
 As would be amenable to a permanent income approach, the consumer habits
 do seem to influenced by the financial standing of the consumer that we
 have attempted to gauge with the assets owned by consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
The aggregation allows us to be more ambitious - 
\bar default
as we include the recall data on household and transport.
 Since we ignore quality differences in the expenditure on transport and
 categories, the AIDS SUR equations use household-CPI and transport-CPI
 as the prices for these respective groups (no 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ V$
\end_inset

 equations are required for the two commodity groups).
 As we use the assets owned for the two groups in these equations instead,
 the asset-scores for transport and household groups are included as household
 characteristics (asset scores are simply a normalised rank assigned to
 the household based on the total assets it possesses) Other household character
istics used in the AIDS SUR equations are family size (

There are two choices for how to observe the usage of electricity in the
 data - first, is to use an electricity-usage related dummy variable and
 second, is to use a probit stage as we have in the first AIDS variant.
 If we were to understand the consumer preference for electricity, a probit
 stage would be more appropriate.
 But since we have already seen from the item-wise AIDS above (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:HeienWesselsAIDS"

\end_inset

) that consumers prefer electricity as their incomes rise, we're more interested
 in understanding how the choice for quality for other commodities can change
 in the context of preference for electricity.
 Hence, a variable indicating the consumer's possession of electric items
 is used in the aggregated model as one of the household characteristics
 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another possible approach is to use an indicator variable for whether the
 consumer uses electricity or not (available in the data through the "lighting

 Here, the quality measure is not used for energy, household and transport.

The results obtained from the SUR confirm many of the findings from the
 itemwise-probit but also suggest the relevance of asset ownership in the
 demand for non-durable items - their quality in particular.
 We notice that having electricity (and assets running on electricity) is
 associated with higher quality for freshfoods and protein - whereas other
 food types such as dense-foods are either not influenced much by having
 electricity or are negatively influenced.
 This may be due to the improvement of household equipment with electricity
 such as refrigerator or ovens - as other household-assets (furniture etc.)
 are not associated with different consumption on quality

It seems that the improved quality in certain food categories is experienced
 with ownership of assets - more than it is with increased income.
 Indeed the higher income seems to improve the quality for densefoods and
 of transport - but not necessarily for other commodities.
 The dense-foods and and non-fresh commodities are also those that are sensitive
 (more so than others) to the increased number of household members.
 The expenditure in the household commodity group - being higher for consumers
 that are in rural areas compared to those in the urban areas - hints at
 certain life-style differences in the densely populated urban areas brought
 about by - amongst other things - the availability of electricity.

It is difficult to infer more general trends on savings and expenditure
 from the possession of electrical assets - whose distribution is non-uniform
 in Tanzania.
 Given the dependency of several industrial assets on electricity, it is
 hardly surprising that those in the urban areas spend differently on items.
 Nevertheless, the observation of quality differences for meat and fresh
 goods indicates a peculiar environment that the distribution of electricity
 is associated with.
 It isn't simply that those with electric assets tend to buy more (due to
 higher conservation offered by refrigerators and other equipment) - but
 the quality purchased appears higher for the consumers who own electrical
 items.
 The users of electricity may be choosing a slightly different environment
 where exotic and pricier meats and fresh products are made available.
 This segregation of quality (in food or in other non-durable commodities)
 speaks more of the environment where the items are consumed than of the
 consumer habits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, if it is possible to model the acquisition of assets over
 time, an intertemporal setting could further enhance our understanding
 of how quality of expenditure changes over time - allowing us to provide
 more robust insights on how long-term utility inclusive of status is indicated
 through consumption - which we view as a combination of quality in commodities
 and acquisition of long-term assets.
 To motivate a discrete model for consumer choice, we now provide a multinomial
 logit analysis of quality against assets owned.

Historical developments in sub-Saharan Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The landscape of the political history of sub-Saharan African is dominated
 by anti-colonial movements in the past century.
 While it seems natural to hope for Adam Smith's principles to take hold
 in the nascent economies of the newly formed republics in the sub-Saharan
 Africa, neither the economic development nor the collective defense of
 nationalistic interests have followed a path similar to that of the developed
 world.
 The industrial class in the African countries is still poor in absolute
 terms and the problems of extreme poverty have remained largely unresolved
 in the large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa.
 The administrative successes and stabilities of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before.
 The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires,
 for example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries
 when compared to the administrative units (much as the political boundaries
 themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The processes of decolonization - which started in the late last century
 - have encompassed the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia
 and Africa aspiring to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 (often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike) their reach and success has been limited.
 in the developing world is that the goals aimed for by Adam Smith - of
 replacing feudalistic rent-seeking with fairness, equity and reward for
 hard-work - have been attempted more often with the nationalistic or socialist
 movements than free trade.
 The role of state has been an uncertain force in the developing world and
 has thus shaped identities at least as much as the evolution of market
 for industrial goods have.

Nigeria

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The access to education is varied in Nigeria - because of the different
 levels of successes missionary education had in Nigeria.
 This in turn has created regional disparities in the current education
 levels between the northern and southern parts of Nigeria.
 The north has had a higher Islamic influence and the uniformity desired
 by the post-colonial government had had some initial challenges.
 At the start of the republic, it seemed that the market forces had been
 left relatively untouched - due to nature of the British rule which encouraged
 participation of a native authority.
 At the same time, the wage labour surviving on the peasantry was a trend
 that continued well into the post-colonial era.
 When the movements of African socialism in Nigeria picked up their momentum,
 the power of merchant class became limited.
 In the more recent decades, when MNCs could have brought more power to
 a working middle class, their presence hasn't changed the state of capital
 being controlled by a small minority - an environment where only the state
 monopolized industries and the informal sector seem to have expanded

.
 The recent Base of Pyramid (BoP) initiatives have not created a sufficient
 base for entrepreneurs, but they have indeed revived a focus on education
 and expanded the market for industrial goods.
 An average of 42% workforce in Nigeria have secondary education or higher.
 Upto 28% of those in mere survival activities have a secondary school certifica
te, and 12% have post-secondary qualifications

 Newly urbanized indigenous tribes and educated classes have taken up jobs
 that had earlier required a much lower level of education.
 The crowding hardly resolves the underlying problems with the economy -
 as the formal sector remains in doldrums.
 The state of economy, rapid population rise and the resulting migration
 from rural areas has given rise to problems urban overcrowding unmitigated
 by a large informal sector

Tanzania

\begin_layout Standard

Given its engagement in the liberation movements in Mozambique in 1974 and
 the faith in planned economy inculcated by Nyrere, it would not be inaccurate
 to consider Tanzania the epicentre of the African socialism.
 But once the political independence was achieved in Tanzania, the membership
 of nationalist parties declined and the separation of civil service from
 political institutions became less of a priority.
 The faith in socialist planning under the leadership of Nyrere meant that
 the reduction of private sector did not experience much opposition.
 With a lack of support from its workers and a ban on producer-consumer
 societies, the socialist model seemed to have had some inconsistencies.
 In the decades after the independence, the industrial sector continued
 to suffer because of import subsidies.
 An import substituting industrialization (ISI) led to oversubsidizing when
 the need to prevent mass starvation called for an adjustment to capital
 flows.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and the use of a capital-intensive technology
 caused the oversubsidizing to spread further across other sectors.
 Subsequently, an over-reliance on capital for development resulted in decline
 of the industrial capacity utilization

 - many arguing that the workforce had moved to a subsistence through cultivatio
n approach.
 In its modern economy, only the public officials have had the advantage
 of becoming entrepreneurs.
 Even though imports could have improved the Tanzanian exchange rate - the
 problems around corruption have always posed limitations to trade reforms
 in Tanzania (particularly in the energy sector)

 With state regulated economy having had no ways to expand, the growth of
 parallel economy has been unavoidable - leaving a disconnect between the
 parallel markets and a protectionist trade policy.
 More recently, the firms from South Africa and China have increasingly
 participated in Tanzania while the training programs for the local labour
 and the plans to develop local infrastructure languish.
 The conflicts between the miners and SA migrant labour are common - while
 many Tanzanians are sent to South Africa for training

 Electricity is only available to about 10% of the population.
