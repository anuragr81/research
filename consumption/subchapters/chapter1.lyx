\begin_layout Abstract
The measures of conspicuous consumption often explore the expenditure on
 a basket of visible items.
 Instead on limiting ourselves to the notion of visibility in a developing
 economy, we compare high-quality across non-durable consumption commodities
 again long-term characteristics education, class as well as the assets
 acquired.
 Arguing that differences in quality among consumers for even basic commodities
 must encompass ...
 we test empirically if the quality vectors corresponding to commodities
 are significantly different for those with higher long-term assets and
 if there is a significant overspending on quality among middle-income consumers
 in urban circumstances.

After accounting for income and the local price of commodities, does having
 more assets in the developing economies significantly influence the consumer's
 expenditure on high-quality i.e.
 do consumers with lower- and medium- level asset possession spend higher
 or lower on price-based quality?

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently studies on visible consumption have explored how expenditure on
 visible goods - items that are assumed unnecessary except for signaling
 status - varies in consumer populations (

key "KausSA,ChaiKaus2019,CharlesHurstRace,OmoriSmithVisRace,ZahraIndia,FrieheGermany"

\end_inset

).
 In the context of a developing economy, we argue that there are two issues
 that must be addressed before this consideration.
 First, in a population where the majority lives at subsistence level, the
 quality in non-visible goods may also be indicative of status.
 Second, there may be long-term assets (visible wealth measures) that both
 serve as necessities and indicate status

Note also that the visibility surveys used in the literature are often adjusted
 to take into account the environment of wider inequalities of the developing
 world.

 for the role of income differences in conspicuous consumption.

.
 In the current chapter, we use the variation in quality observed in Tanzania
 - a growing economy in the sub-Saharan Africa - to argue how observations
 of conspicuous consumption may need to be qualified due to subsistence-level
 consumption and observed differences in quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a variation in quality may be of little relative significance in societies
 that have less inequality and strong social welfare institutions.- but they
 are of a material concern in a developing economy where most consumers
 have few long-term assets and struggle with meeting basic needs.
 Thus, in the particular context of sub-Saharan African, where the rapid
 economic development may tempt one to draw parallels with ideas of conspicuous
 consumption (due to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) in the 19th century North America, the limited amenities and extreme inequalit
ies may present a landscape different from that of America's gilded age

 view of conspicuous consumption).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of quality across commodities which we compare against long-term
 assets possessions in this study - does not benefit from the implications
 of separability through the futility of conspicuous consumption.
 More specifically, the assumption that visible goods are of no utility
 other than signaling implies that the utility from visible consumption
 is additively separable (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The empirical significance of such a separation of consumption utility
 - so that visible utility is only of a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

public
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 significance and is futile in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

private
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sense - is that the demand from multiple visible items can be aggregated
 across multiple commodity groups.
 For example, the utility from jewelry or luxury cars could be seen as one
 of visible significance - allowing us to consider the demand for visible
 goods.
 The aggregate of high quality from across commodities does not benefit
 from this assumption since quality across different commodities is both
 of private and public significance to the consumer.
 A substitution between all goods of higher quality cannot be argued for
 in the way one argues for substitution or aggregation among visible goods
 with no private utility

The futility assumption is attributed to

.
 An measurement of quality across commodities may thus only help us understand
 the conditions where conspicuous consumption may thrive instead of providing
 us futility-based measure for conspicuous consumption
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Status is a complex social psychological phenomenon and there is an inherent
 bias in concluding what is a status good and what is not.
 For example, if one were to rely only on whether an item can be afforded
 by the rich - then electricity, being used by a small and rich part of
 the population in a sub-Saharan African country like Tanzania, may appear
 to be a status good - at par with weddings (which are a clearer way of
 indicating status).
 But whether the same amount of money spent on weddings enhances status
 more than when it's spent on electricity is a far more difficult question
 to answer.
 Similarly, one could argue that buying clothes indicates higher status
 and go on to record the consumption on clothes as conspicuous consumption.
 But without observing the effect that getting electricity in the house
 or moving to a bigger house may have on a consumer's long-term utility
 and the perceived status, we cannot assume a significant status-benefit
 to the consumer from expenditure on clothing.
 Such issues are less problematic in the developed economies - where the
 differences in assets are less and visible consumption is more relevant
 for status given the otherwise (relatively) equal society (see

To avoid confusion in the terminology associated goods and quality, we stick
 to the nomenclature provided by

\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CoxWohlgenant1986"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for further notes on this nomenclature).
 For reasons we later elaborate, the quality across different commodity
 groups is treated separately instead of being combined into a notion of
 overall quality.
 The quality metric used in the analysis depends on the local market prices
 available for food and energy commodities (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 For food - which accounts for most of the consumption in the rural areas
 - the quality metric (as used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) is calculated as the quantity consumed of high vs low-price variants
 of the food sub-categories (e.g.
 protein, starch etc.).
 Eggs and milk - for example are deemed of lower quality than goat and beef
 for proteins.
 These sub-categories within food are demarcated using the structure of
 the observed market prices and functional utility.
 More specifically, the food items are grouped first into broad functionality-ba
sed categories of protein, fat etc.
 and then sub-divided into groups having similar price structure.
 This later sub-division is due to the Hick's composite commodity theorem
 which we elaborate further in Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement of quality across four commodity groups of items - food,
 energy, household and transport - is simplified due to not all commodities
 dominated by quality of non-durable consumption.
 More particularly, since consumption quality differences among consumers
 through commodities such as transport are more likely to be through the
 assets such as a car owned by the consumer households rather than quality
 of taxi or public-transport, the variation in quality can be ignored for
 non-durable consumption in commodities such as household or transport goods
 if the respective assets (transport- or household- related assets) have
 already been considered.
 The variation in quality is thus ignored for household and transport categories
 - which are considered elementary commodities after taking into account
 assets related to household and transport.

 Here, the income of the consumer is controlled the total expenditure -

).
 The needs of the consumers are controlled with  the number of family members
 adjusted for their age.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the above quality metric and the simplification, we compare the price-based
 quality across commodities against the long-term asset possessions and
 the demographic characteristics such as education, class or region associated
 with the household.
 The possible segmentation of quality based on owned assets is key to this
 analysis.
 More particularly, if the differences in both quality and asset possessions
 are significant across the population, then the role of status consumption
 is limited.
 Using the test for whether there are significant differences in quality
 associated with higher levels of asset ownership in a developing country
 or not, we argue that extreme differences should rule out any status competitio
ns among the groups separated by both quality and long-term asset ownership.

 Allowing the consumer utility to optimise both quality and quantity while
 treating quality as a separate good, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 decomposed the quality price elasticity of demand (quantity purchased)
 into a quantity price elasticity of expenditure on quality and an income
 elasticity of quality measure.
 The treatment of quality as a separate good has since been widely used
 in the literature.
 The simple repackaging method - for example - treats a high-quality good
 as multiples of the lower quality good(s).
 More specifically, if the quality for a (composite) good is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and the base-price is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

, the repackaging method seeks an adjusted-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 so that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
x(p_{1}^{*},p_{2},...) & \equiv x(p_{1}^{1},p_{2},...,b)\label{eq:income_simple_repackaging_quality}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, the demand for goods with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 is viewed in terms of both the base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and the quality parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\{b_{1},b_{2},...\}$
\end_inset

).
 The implicit assumption in the repackaging approach is that the variants
 in every category are perfect substitutes.
 This often turns out to be a stringent requirement for empirical application
 of the repackaging method across commodities when there are extreme 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

jumps
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in quality.
 A consumer switching from kerosene usage to electricity usage - despite
 the improvement in energy 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - may not be satisfactorily explained by viewing electricity consumption
 in terms of the quantity and price of kerosene consumed.
 Still, the simple-repackaging model is useful in the context of the cost-of-liv
ing index problem where such a substitution is implied (see the classical
 application in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More recent approaches to measuring quality (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,AndalonGibsonSoda2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) have relied on the recorded quantities of goods consumed.
 Since the quantities consumed are less often available for non-food commodities
 in consumer surveys, these methods have been limited to analysis for food
 quality.
 Further, the issue of unavailability of market prices in the quantity-based
 approaches to food quality has only recently gathered attention 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 More specifically, the measurement of quality is often performed without
 the available market prices by simply averaging over the expenditures in
 a given region (or over the entire population of consumers).
 The so-called implicit price-deflator (or unit-value) method uses these
 averages in place of prices in the empirical analyses (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

While price-deflators may be appropriate for certain empirical questions,
 the measurement errors introduced by their use are difficult to ignore
 for finer conclusions related to price and income elasticities.
 More particularly, the quantity consumed appearing both in the dependent
 variable (as budget share's numerator) and in the control variable (as
 the denominator for unit-value used as price) cannot be always mitigated
 for many questions related to consumer preferences

 Since the market prices available in the survey prevent such measurements

 For the same reason, we also avoid other approaches such as the RDMP (

A quality-metric associated with a certain commodity (e.g.
 for protein or fat) depends on a grouping of items into commodities subject
 to a certain homegeneity restrictions.
 Given the quantity consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $\{q_{i}\}_{i\in[1,n]}=\{q_{1},q_{2},...,q_{n}\}$

\begin_inset Formula $G\in[1,M]$

\begin_layout Standard
Such an aggregation requires that the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 groups (commodities) are separable and that the demand for items within
 each group is a homogenous function of the goods it contains (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The approach followed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - using the sum of physical quantities as measure of demand - puts the
 homogeneity restriction on the consumer preferences and assumes that the
 within-group preferences are homothetic.
 While this approach may be preferable in the absence of market-prices,
 we used Hick's commodity theorem-based approach suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where quality is aggregated within groups only when a constant relative
 price-structure can be assumed.
 The approaches from both

literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 do not use the homogenous commodities assumption and in fact permit heterogenei
ty in the use of sums of physical quantities used as the measure of demand.
 Instead of adding the weight of chicken and eggs consumed into one commodity,
 we consider chicken and eggs into one commodity only if the relative price
 structure for the two items (chicken and eggs) does not change.
 Our notion of quality thus relies on a price-weighted quantity (made possible
 due the availability of market prices) so that given the same expenditure
 a lower quality corresponds to a higher quality and vice versa (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

 for further details).
 Note that the quality measurement is relevant only for food and energy-
 which are viewed as composite commodities whereas the household and transport
 categories which also comprise of household and transport assets (respectively)
 owned by the household are viewed as elementary commodities with no associated
 quality metric.

The advantage of comparing quality of commodity groups rather than individual
 items is that the aggregated approach does not pose the issue of non-consumptio
n of high-quality goods.
 More specifically, if one were to calculate the price elasticities for
 individual goods, the obvious issue that arises is that certain items (particul
arly those with high-quality) might not be consumed at all for a significant
 part of the consumer population.

 Further, the unit-values obtained from the consumers' using a good are

 While Heien-Wells approach may be well-suited for comparison of elasticities
 for particular goods (see Appendix III for empirical results using the
 approach), the comparison of quality across multiple commodities which
 we seek for an overview of quality is better implemented with an AIDS method
 including demographic characteristics and using a market-prices based quality.
 Since it is much less likely for no goods to be consumed within a broader
 commodity group (fruits-veg, protein etc.) over which the quality measure
 is calculated, the approach with quality aggregated over broader commodity
 groups also circumvents the issue of non-consumption.
 No correction related to non-consumption - as used in the Heien-Wells method
 - is therefore required with the approach that aggregates quality over
 groups classified with homogeneity restrictions (see Section

\begin_layout Standard
In the empirical studies on demand, the separability of demand for commodities
 that are grouped on the basis of their functional utility is often assumed.
 Even though the separability of consumer demand is not always verified
 empirically, the assumption of separability is nearly ubiquitous in the
 literature as it is one of the least intrusive assumptions one could make
 on the structure of demand.
 The high-level interpretations of consumption across separable groups facilitat
e a comparison of current demand with the past consumption as well as from
 across the cross-section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the ubiquity of separable groups in the demand literature, the issue
 of separability is sparingly discussed in the literature on conspicuous
 consumption.
 This seems in part due to the properties of the utility following the assumptio
n of futility of visible consumption.
 More particularly, the assumption that all visible goods serve no purpose
 other than signaling, allows one to group the demand from visible goods
 as if it were from a single commodity-group.
 A within-group homogeneity through the futility assumption thus allows
 one to measure the consumption of conspicuous items as if they were a good
 apart from others.
 The argument that conspicuous consumption has a zero-utility is attributed
 to

In examining the overall high-quality without using the futility assumption,
 we cannot assume equivalently that the an overall quality can be inferred
 from high quality goods across all the commodity groups.
 The absence of the futility assumption prevents the homogeneity restriction
 across all high-quality items the way a homogeneity is argued for in the
 group of visible goods taken together.
 Thus our measurement of quality treats higher-quality within each commodity
 group separate from each other - where the commodity groups are demarcated

We note that a two-state budgeting approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 cannot be used for quality due to the lack of substitution among high-quality
 goods from across commodity groups.
 More particularly, the requirement of the two-state budgeting is that the
 relative demand between two goods in any two different categories must
 change only in response to their total expenditure.
 That the response to price changes and total expenditure changes must use
 the same channels of communication in the commodity tree

) is a condition that fails with a substitution of quality from across commodity
 groups.
 To explain this with an example, consider two-groups : food and energy
 which in turn consist of beef-bread-milk and electricity-kerosene-charcoal
 respectively.
 The two-state budget would work with consumers allocating expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy in the first-stage while choosing expenditures on kerosene
 or electricity with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and on beef or bread with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

 in the second-stage.
 While the weak separability of food and energy ensures that the cheaper
 bread (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer
 choose a more expensive fuel (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"

), the property is be guaranteed when instead of food , energy, the consumer
 selects quality  across commodity groups.
 If a consumer can substitute utility from quality in electricity with that
 form eating beef, then deciding on

 in the first-stage does not guarantee that the consumption of electricity
 would not change when the price of beef changes.

 ) which states that a group of goods behave as if it were a single commodity
 so long as the the prices of the group of goods changes in the same proportion.
 Simply put, a constant relative price structure allows us to factor out
 the quantity of the composite commodity consumed from the demand function
 for the variants (goods) within the commodity - allowing the price of quality
 to be interpreted in terms of a composite price

 Instead of viewing demands for {wheat, rice, corn, eggs, beef, chicken,
 fish, charcoal, kerosene, electricity} individually with a list of 10 functions
 for example, the above formulation allows us to view demands for commodities
 {carb, protein and energy} that encompass the 10 goods with just 3 respective
 functions corresponding to the 3 commodity groups.
 Other than the high-level categories of the commodities (protein, fat etc.),
 the key requirement for the validity of such a quality metric is that the
 prices of goods within the commodity group have a constant relative structure.
 We perform this classification of groups based on the observed market prices
 of the items in years 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 for Tanzania (see Section

 The sub-groups within food are primarily based on the correlated changes
 in price from 2008 until 2014 and are then split into functional groups.
 For example, the price changes for sugar and tea are more similar to each
 other as as the rice and cooking-oil.
 We put sugar and tea within a group of complements but avoid splitting
 rice and cooking-oil into starch and fat and instead put rice and cooking_oil

 A functional category is essentially one where there is a sufficient degree

\begin_layout Standard
The identification the commodities over which the quality measure is to
 be aggregated over also makes use of a simplification that not all variation
 in quality is considered of importance to the consumer.
 In other words, both quantity and quality in a commodity aggregate matter
 to the consumer only if there are no long-term assets associated with the
 aggregate.
 Due to this simplification, the variation quality is ignored for a particular
 commodity category if the there are long-term assets that dominate the
 utility from consumption.
 For example, having a car and hiring a limousine taxi in the transport
 commodity category may both provide some utility to the consumer.
 Here, the above simplification implies that only one of i) non-durable
 consumption and ii) long-term assets in the commodity group dominates the
 consumer utility.
 Therefore, in the transport commodity group, only either of i) car ownership
 or ii) expensive-taxi-rides matter to the consumer.
 The implications of this assumption are not serious in the consumption
 data from Tanzania where the non-durable expenditure on transport and household
 is dominated by the role of assets.
 Thus, out of the commodity aggregates - energy, transport household and
 those associated with food (fruits-vegetables, non-fresh goods etc.), quality
 is only considered for energy and food aggregates (composite commodities)
 due the non-durable nature of their consumption.
 On the other hand, only total expenditure is considered of importance for
 non-durable consumption in transport and household categories (the elementary
 commodities).
 As long as one may classify every commodity group as either dominated by
 long-term asset or not, there are only two ways a consumer can spend on
 quality - either by switching between the variants of a composite commodity
 (choosing higher or lower quality of a composite commodity where long-term
 assets do not exist) or spending more on an elementary commodity (where
 long-term assets dominate and quality variation doesn't exist).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that an elementary commodity is one where no quality variation is
 supposed to exist and higher quality can be achieved only through more
 purchases of the commodity.
 A composite commodity - on the other hand - is a commodity where a sufficient
 quality variation exists and a consumer can use a mix of higher quality
 and lower-quality goods within the commodity.
 The quality metric to be calculated thus applies only to the composite
 commodities.

 Since quality is to be priced in the market, we can consider this price-structu
red weighted quantity as the quality-adjusted quantity and express the pair
\begin_inset Formula $\{(20,1.5).(10,2)\}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,5(=2\times1.5+1\times2))$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.14=\frac{4}{1.5+2})$
\end_inset

 .
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 is simply the minimum of 
\begin_inset Formula $20,10$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 and the price-structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is (2,1) for {lamb,chicken}.

We use the quality metric across commodity groups defined in Section

 to measure how the demand for quality is distributed across the population
 and varies in response to prices, consumer needs and other household characteri
stics in the cross-section (a vector of occupation, education, region/locality/n
eighborhood/assets).
 A consumer having undergone changes in her long-term circumstances is treated
 the same as a consumer with different needs and/or long-term assets in
 the cross-section.

 fruits-vegetables, non-fresh food items (dry carbohydrates such as rice,
 wheat), complements (tea, coffee etc.) and densefoods (dense energy providing
 food as buns, pasta, flours) while an indicator variable is used for energy
 - specifying whether the consumer uses electricity or not.

.
 The ownership of assets for transport and household which appears as the
 control variable in the AIDS regression is measured with the logarithm
 of the costs of the assets owned.
 The quality variation is ignored for transport and household expenditure
 categories and thus only the total expenditure is considered in the AIDS
 system of equations.

With the recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, Tanzania
 serves as a case-study of consumer markets in the developing sub-Saharan
 Africa.
 In more recent times, the investments from South Africa and Western countries
 have significantly expanded in the country and the trends of urbanisation
 are evident in the consumption data.
 The data we use for our analysis is from the Living Standard Measurement
 Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World Bank - for years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 To understand the political economy of Tanzania with respect to other republics
 in the region, we provide a brief historical overview of Tanzania, Nigeria,
 Angola and Kenya in Appendix I.
\end_layout

The LSMS survey records past expenditure with diary and recall methods.
 The diary method is used for food items while other purchases are recorded
 as weekly, monthly and yearly recalls.
 The expenditures on food are recorded with a greater level of detail than
 other expenditures.
 The summary statistics from the LSMS microdata for 2010 (base year) are
 presented in the Table

The demographic variables from survey that we use in our a cross-sectional
 analysis are the language-spoken, current locality, place of origin, the
 education and occupational levels.
 While the income data is available in the survey, we use it only indirectly
 with a mapping of incomes on to the list of occupational (ordered) ranks.
 More specifically, we sort the occupations based on the average income
 received before categorising them in broader ranks ranging form 1 to 3
 (non-paying occupations are unemployed status is set to 0).
 The assignment of occupation ranks from occupation field is shown in Table

 The reason why we avoid using the income data more directly is that it
 is available for only around 30% of the households (which we have diary
 data for).

Before it may be used for measurement for quality, the consumption microdata
 from the survey years is normalised - merging the weekly data with yearly
 data by multiplying the past week's consumption into the number of weeks
 in the year.
 The details of this process are described in Appendix II.
 Once normalised, the matching of market prices for the goods consumed by
 a household is done for food and energy subgroups

The absence of a good in the recall record for a household as the good is
 not to be interpreted as evidence of non-usage of the good.
 With the case of electricity, for example, the field for

 is more reliable for the test of electricity usage than the last expenditure

 available as market prices in the district where the consumer resides.

Since the market-observed prices in the survey are recorded at every district
 level or at finer levels, we match these prices with every household in

 we simply use the price at a national level

 When there are multiple price observations at the district level (through
 price capture in more than one constituent wards or villages), then we
 arrive a district-level price using a regression over price records for
 the good in the district.
 The use of the regression for obtaining the market-prices at the district
 level also makes sense because prices are recorded in several units.
 By assimilating all the price data from across the quantities and regions
 in the regression, we use the coefficients to obtain the price for a unit-quant
ity of an good (kg,litres etc.).
 Here, as the unit-prices grow at a less than linear rate with quantity,
 we use a quadratic expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 to regress the observed marked-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 against the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 they're recorded in where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a constant .
 The price of any arbitrary quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}$
\end_inset

 of a good is thus simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{\underline{q}^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 and for the price of unit-quantity that we use for base-prices and relative
 price structures, the price is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

 ).

The values of assets owned by the consumer that we use as control variable(s)
 are obtained from the record of durable goods in the survey.
 The durable goods in the LSMS data range from short-term durable items
 such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such as land
 or housing.
 Of these, we are interested only in the transferable long-term owned assets
 that undergo changes in the survey years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 We verify the assets transferred over a generation by inspecting households
 in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit family starts
 a new household - treating the assets except land and house that are more
 expensive than the bed (furniture) as those that contribute to the long-term
 asset-values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.

%What we need from the regression however, is merely the price of the unit-quant
ity (e.g.
 the price per kg for rice in the current example) rather than matching
 the appropriate marked price with the quantity purchased by the consumer.
 If we were to really look for a perfect match for prices, then we should
 not only match the quantities consumed by the consumer with the prices
 recorded in the market but also the time of the household interview with
 that of the price recorded.
 This fine matching is both impractical (survey prices being hardly available
 at such fine levels of granularity) and unnecessary since our view of price
 is that of a value that is faced by a sufficiently large number of consumers
 in the survey.

%One may argue that a selection bias is introduced when we use the national-aver
ages for some goods and region averages for other.
 This could be a problem if the unavailability of regional averages occurred
 for a significant portion of price entries.
 However, since only about  of the total price observations have no regional
 averages (only a few goods suffer with the issue), the bias thus introduced
 would be rather insignificant.
 Another issue could be taken with our grouping of commodities - as it relies
 on the annual time-series data.
 It is indeed possible that the price of some goods may be more volatile
 than the others - and thus the volatility being ignored in the annual time
 series data would bring some bias.
 But since we combine the household log diary with the recall diary (which
 is recorded on a monthly or yearly basis), a finer time-series for prices
 is not enough to address this issue.
 Such a bias could be alleviated only through finer price data and a uniformly
 collected household consumption microdata.

 is simply the minimum price of the goods within the commodity group.
 Here, only the locally observed market prices (at the district level) rather
 than the unit-values (estimated by averaging expenditure over a locality)
 for goods within a composite commodity aggregate are used for the base-price
 computation.
 The expenditure on household and transportation commodity groups - on the
 other hand - are treated as if they were (each) just one commodity i.e.
 elementary commodities with no quality differences observed in the non-durable
 consumption within the commodity group.
 The sum of expenditure on clothing, soaps, cosmetics and other household
 goods appear as part of budget shares

 As market -prices are not recorded for these goods in the survey, the CPI

The results obtained from the SUR shown in Table

status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsAllassets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 suggest the relevance of asset ownership in the demand for quality in non-durab
le goods.
 Apart from the higher expenditure (
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
) i.e.
 the permanent income measure, the consumer habits also seem to be influenced
 by the occupation rank .
 More specifically, the higher occupation ranks tend to have both higher
 quantity and higher quality across all commodities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since higher occupation-ranks are concentrated in the eastern coast and
 centre of Tanzania, we also look at the effect of 
\family typewriter
expensiveregion
\family default
 to see how higher living-costs in a region may influence the consumption
 of quality.
 The effects of 
\family typewriter
expensiveregion
\family default
 suggest a higher quality for non-fresh and protein goods in particular.
 The expensive-regions also show a higher expenditure on transport and energy
 (albeit a lower expenditure on household non-durable consumption in certain
 regions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of overall assets owned on quality (see the results for the dependent
 variable 
\family typewriter
qV-
\family default
 ) after accounting for urban-rural effects ( see significance of 
\family typewriter
expensiveregion
\family default
) and total expenditure ( 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 ) is not significant, but the consideration of the owned electric assets
 shows significant differences in quality (particularly for protein and
 non-fresh categories) i.e.
 it's not just the access to higher food quality that differentiates the
 urban asset-rich consumer, but the quality in energy, transport is also
 associated with the use (availability) of electricity.
 This seems both due to the relative affluence of regions where electricity
 is available and more directly through possible improvements to quality
 brought about by ownership of electric assets (appliances).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since food prices seem high overall in the areas where more quality is availed,
 the affluence being limited to specific districts seems to the more likely
 cause for higher consumption quality in urban areas.
 Looking at the effect of (base-)prices on quality and quantity, we see
 for example with 
\family typewriter
lpprotein
\family default
 that high base-price of protein (cheapest protein available in the district)
 corresponds to higher quality - meaning that consumers in districts where
 base-price of protein (price of cheapest protein) is high also avail higher
 quality of protein.
 This seems to be the case with 
\family typewriter
lpfruitsveg
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
lpnonfresh
\family default
 as well.
 The effect seems to be reversed with price of energy since quality for
 food drops where energy (i.e.kerosene for most districts) is costlier - implying
 that energy is relatively costly in both urban and rural settings.
 A pressure on consumer basket quality is also supported by larger families
 (
\family typewriter
consu
\family default
) not having a higher quality in protein or fruits-veg but instead only
 showing slightly higher quantity for energy and densefoods.
 The larger families have less household consumption as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from the SUR with assets split into electrical, household and
 transport assets - that show the relevance of electric assets in quality
 - are presented in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsSubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 Here, the consumption on energy is higher for electricity users due to
 the high prices of electricity but the owners of electrical assets also
 appear to consume more fruits-veg quality and have a higher expenditure
 on household products.
 For general household-assets (that are not transport-related and are not
 electric) on the other hand, we do not see a significant association with
 quality (only slightly higher non-fresh and fruits-veg quantities).
 This suggests that some evidence of deprivation in the urban areas.
 This is also supported from the comparison of the fraction of households
 having run out of food (either due to lack of agricultural inputs or high
 prices) across urban and rural areas in Tanzania (see Figures

\begin_layout Standard
The above observations suggest that the role of assets-ownership is significant
 in the quality of consumption for food as well as energy.
 Further, the life-style differences in the densely populated urban areas
 brought about by availability of industrial goods is the underlying theme
 for the effect of asset differences.
 Even through the urban consumers may have less overall assets compared
 to their counterparts in rural areas, they seem to spend more on quality
 - particularly on protein and fruits-veg (compared to dense-foods and household
 asset).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of assets seems strong after taking 
\family typewriter
expensiveregion 
\family default
into account.
 Thus, even though there may be some positive externality with being in
 the urban areas, the differences in quality of consumption brought about
 by asset-differences are significant.

Robustness Checks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure that the relevance of high asset ownership (and electrical assets
 in particular) for differences of quality is a robust observation, we rerun
 the SUR with an aggregated food category.
 This formulation no longer uses the price-based groups and views all food-subca
tegories as one food group
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The quality is still calculated based on the prices.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 Using the CPI of food basket as prices (just the way transport CPI and
 household CPI are used) the above analysis is repeated with food, energy,
 transport and household as separable categories.
 In the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsFoodCPIAllAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsFoodCPISubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, a preference for higher quality for household asset owners is observed
 when we use a food aggregate (a collection of the subcategories).
 More specifically, the food quality increases with total expenditure and
 with acquisition of household assets.
 As one would expect, transport costs appear higher in the urban areas.
 The non-durable expenditure on household goods and overall food quality
 both decrease for urban areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a further test of the robustness of results, we calculate the food-quality
 using the market-provided prices and instead of the expenditure reported
 by the consumer.
 More specifically, the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{resultsAllassets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsSubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 we have used diary-costs on goods as reported by the consumer.
 However, the LSMS records this cost only from the goods that were consumed
 from purchases in the last week.
 If a consumer didn't purchase anything in the past week, there would only
 be quantities consumed (not costs) that would be reported for the consumer
 in the diary.
 Since we have the market-prices available, another way to calculate costs,
 budget-shares and quality would be to infer costs as the multiple of market-pri
ces from the quantities consumed in the past week (which is reported for
 all consumers regardless of whether they had purchased something in the
 last week or not).
 Recalculating quality and budget shares still shows us the same economic
 and statistical significance (results available on request) of electricity
 and household assets in quality of fruitsveg, proteins and other subcategories.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The availability of market-prices and the details on household characteristics
 as well as owned assets allow us to understand the factors that may cause
 the differences in the consumer baskets and influence consumption of quality.
 Given the differences in consumer baskets for the urban and rural consumer,
 it is not surprising that those in the urban areas spend differently on
 certain non-durable goods.
 Nevertheless, the sustained quality differences for meat and fresh goods
 for urban consumers indicate a peculiar environmental difference in urban
 areas with availability of electricity and industrial goods.
 It is not that those with higher asset worth consistently tend to buy a
 higher quality - but that the quality purchased for a few categories are
 always higher (lower) for the consumers who own medium-cost electricity-related
 assets.
 We conclude therefore that the differences in lifestyles between urban
 and rural lifestyles - due in particular to the sparse availability of
 electricity - dominate the consumption of quality more than the effect
 that long-term asset-differences may play in the demand for quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has some implications for the notion of status consumption.
 If we can argue that the fulfillment of needs alone (which are the same
 for every consumer) does not contribute to one's status, then status consumptio
n must be only through long-term assets and with the quality in consumption.
 The scope for status through consumption therefore gets limited when the
 poorer consumer lags extremely behind both in term of the quality in consumptio
n and long-term assets.
 Unlike in the developed economies, where the basic needs of the consumers
 are largely fulfilled and the differences in long-term asset ownership
 relatively less extreme, the role of status through consumption is much
 lower when both asset and quality differences are high.
 Thus, there being a positive externality with being in the urban area may
 not results in a significant status consumption in an economy such as Tanzania
 - where the rural or poorer consumers lagging in asset-possessions as well
 as consumption quality (since quality in food and household seem to move
 together with electricity and owned-assets) prevents a status competition
 with the richer or urban consumer.

Historical background of sub-Saharan African economies

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The landscape of the political history of sub-Saharan African is dominated
 by anti-colonial movements of the past century - but the changes in the
 nascent economies of the newly formed republics in the sub-Saharan Africa
 have been hardly uniform.
 The industrial class in many sub-Saharan African countries is still poor
 in absolute terms.
 The administrative successes and stability of post-colonial governments
 are varied - depending often on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before in the economies.
 It would seem that the extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman
 or Moghul empires, for example, could be adapted well by European colonists
 in Asian countries when compared to the administrative units (much as the
 political boundaries themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The educational infrastructure created during early missionary activity
 and railway infrastructure left from mining activities also seem to have
 given some advantages some particular regions.
 In the end, the processes of decolonization starting in the late last century
 that have encompassed loosely similar post-war political voices have had
 mixed successes.
 Here, we provide a brief overview of the historical background of a few
 sub-Saharan African countries - by highlighting the similarities and peculiarit
ies of the current modern republics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Nigeria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
A distinguishing feature of Nigeria's economy seems to be a differential
 access to education.
 The education levels across the northern and southern parts of Nigeria
 seem split also based on the religions affiliations - the north of the
 country has had a more significant Islamic influence whereas the South
 has been influenced by Western Christianity.
 The other relevant feature of the political economy has been the uncertain
 role played by market forces.
 In the initial years of the republic, the market forces might have had
 been left relatively untouched (even though farming-based wage labour continued
 into the post-colonial era), but the movements of African socialism seemed
 to have limited the power of merchant class to some extent.
 This seems partly responsible for some of the difficulties in the formation
 of a strong base for small businesses in the economy.
 Despite the presence of quite a few multi-national corporations in more
 recent decades, a strong business sector stills appears lacking in Nigeria.
 The majority of these corporations being state-backed monopolies does not
 sufficiently assist the transformation of the the large informal sectors
 in the economy  into a middle class with a significant purchasing power
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WilliamsGNigeria"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 But while the recent developments may not have created a wide base for
 entrepreneurs, they have revived a focus on education and expanded the
 market for industrial goods.
 For example, an average of 42% workforce in Nigeria have secondary education
 or higher, upto 28% of those in mere survival activities have a secondary
 school certificate and 12% have post-secondary qualifications

 As such the competitions for status may be hardly ruled out in the country.

Tanzania 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Given its engagement in the liberation movements in Mozambique in 1974 and
 the faith in planned economy inculcated by Nyrere, it would not be inaccurate
 to consider Tanzania the epicentre of the African socialism.
 However, once the political independence was achieved, the membership of
 nationalist parties declined and the separation of civil service from political
 institutions became less of a priority.
 The faith in socialist planning under the leadership of Nyrere meant that
 the reduction of private sector did not experience much opposition.
 However, inconsistencies were apparent in Tanzania's socialist model with
 insufficient support from workers and a ban on producer-consumer societies.
 The industrial sector seemed to have suffered because of import subsidies
 until many decades after the independence.
 The import substituting industrialization (ISI) often led to oversubsidizing
 and adjustment to capital flows in order to provide for basic needs.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy combined with the capital-intensive technology
 resulted in high costs for economic development across sectors and a subsequent
 decline of the industrial capacity utilization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In its modern economy, it would not be an overstatement that the public
 officials have had an unfair advantage in becoming entrepreneurs.
 The problems around corruption also present limitations to the trade reforms
 in Tanzania (particularly in the energy sector)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LofchieTNZ"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The state regulated economy also presents somewhat of a disconnect of the
 parallel markets from a protectionist trade policy.
 While the use of internet communications is higher in Tanzania than in
 Africa's average, the private's sector access to finance is low (albeit
 rising) and the size of informal sector substantial (60% of the labour
 market
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WBBrief2009"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 The access to electricity is limited to about 10% of the population and
 the quality of life differs significantly between urban and rural regions.
 The status competitions in Tanzania seem to be influenced by these disparities.

 group that included urban intellectuals, nominally led the country
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Similar to other post-colonial economies, the state-controlled companies
 thrived in Angola.
 The state oil company Sonagol - for example - seemed to have played a quasi-fis
cal role.
 The economy's dependence on oil revenues made economic diversification
 difficult
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 changes often tend to be contested on ethnic lines.

 the discontent was strong but predominantly from the non-

 Other attempts at nationalization - e.g.
 taking control of foods sales or establishment of purchase centres - have

 growing private sector

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock goods for consumption.
 The LSMS survey records the quantities for food goods - even if they were
 not purchased in the past week.
 But for other non-food goods (such as soap, skin creams whose quantities
 are not recorded in the survey) are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families as well.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption.
 To verify that this not a significant issue, we first test if such stocking
 (quantities purchased) may be uniform in all region in the country.
 We then test the significance of household factors that may affect long-term
 storage (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) of the purchased item.
 Observing the quantity purchased on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure on all goods 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we use a difference-in-means analysis to confirm the low effect of travel-cost
s on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{e}{x})$
\end_inset

 and conclude that stockpiling is not significant.
 It turns out that the number of family members is a far more significant
 factor for large purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wide categories of energy, transport and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.

 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis.
 These goods were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,

 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk goods where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the goods where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not

\begin_inset Formula $P=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}ln(p_{ih})$

 is also often used (Stone's index).
 Notice that the inverse-mills instrument must also comply with the symmetry
 and homogeneity-restrictions and thus one must ensure that

Implementation and Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step with the selection approach is a probit where the dependent
 variable is an indicator variable that is unity when the item is consumed
 and zero otherwise.
 The control variables used in the first-stage probit are the prices of
 the item and market-characteristics (region etc.
 - see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_probit"

\end_inset

) .
 The inverse-mills ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invmills"

\end_inset

 - see Heien-Wessells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "true"

\end_inset

) is then used as an instrument in the AIDS regressions(see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).
 The results thus obtained with a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) after
 imposing the constraints are presented in the Table

 The own-price and cross-price elasticities presented in the results provide

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The columns in the table (names starting with q) indicate the budget shares
 that are used as the dependent variables in the second-stage regression

\begin_layout Standard
The above item-wise analysis suggests a split between the goods that are
 consumed in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant)
 against those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer
 are more readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education show that the goods available
 in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive elasticitie
s for income and education rank whereas the goods of agrarian production
 seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations huddled
 in the urban areas.
 Similarly, how consumers respond to changes in kerosene and electricity
 prices indicates the limited availability of industrial goods.
 A contrast between the goods that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this urban-rural
 split as well (demand for goods such as rice, beef is less sensitive to
 electricity than it is to kerosene).
 It isn't simply that the electricity consumers are more likely to consume
 the more expensive goods (due to their higher incomes) but that a certain
 goods become less relevant in the urban settings or are simply unavailable
 in the rural settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further, the signs of the coefficients suggest that mangoes (less
 consumed) and rice (commonly consumed) to be substitutes while fish appears
 as a complement to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.)
 rice.
 Similarly, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_f
lour]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens - while it is a substitute to bread
 and mangoes respectively.
 The substitution and complementarity thus observed are hardly an indicator
 of the overall quality since the reported cross-price elasticities do not
 consider the functional separation.
 More specifically, one cannot make much out of the cross-elasticities of
 kerosene with respect to buns or cassava unless without imposing strict
 separability assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or model restrictions (such as more buns would means less cooking in the
 household etc.).
 An aggregated view of the basket is thus preferred given our interest in
 the choice of quality exercised by the consumer when faced with multiple
 varieties of several qualities and price.
