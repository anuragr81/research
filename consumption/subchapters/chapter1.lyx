\begin_layout Abstract
The measures of status consumption often explore the expenditure on a basket
 of visible items.
 Instead on limiting ourselves to the notion of visibility in a developing
 economy, we view status consumption as non-durable consumption chosen by
 the consumer to offset hierarchies implied by households characteristic
 such as education, regional identity and long-term assets.
 Arguing that difference in quality in basic commodities must encompass
 status in poorer economies, we test empirically if the quality vectors
 corresponding to the basic commodities are significantly different for
 those with higher long-term assets after accounting for total expenditure
 and household characteristics.

The studies on visible consumption often explore how the expenditure on
 visible goods - items that at least purportedly are not necessary for the
 consumer except for signaling status.
 In the context of developing economies, we find two issues with the approach.
 First, for population where the majority lives at subsistence level, the
 quality in non-visible items may also be indicative of status.
 Second, there may be expensive long-term assets which may serve both serve
 necessities and indicate status.
 While these effects are of little significance in relative equal societies
 with strong institutions for social welfare, two concerns are of importance
 for status consumption in the developing economies.

Thus, while the rapid economic development in Africa may tempt one to draw
 parallels from Veblen's idea of conspicuous consumption capturing the developme
nts in the 19th century North America, the current problems in extending
 the upward mobility to the masses in the developing economies highlight
 a landscape different from that of the America's gilded age (see Ustuner
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 In the environment of nascent economic growth which we observe in the sub-Sahar
an Africa, the options for conspicuous consumption are limited to a very
 small chunks of the geography.
 What it means for our investigation of status consumption is that instead
 of focusing on demand for what may be considered visible items that may
 not be consumed by the majority, we observe status as an aggregate of the
 high quality in consumption and the possession of long-term assets.
 We believe that these provide us broader view of the status differences
 caused by consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 More specifically, we are interested in status consumption as the expenditure
 on non-durable consumption made to either overcome or enhance the role
 of long-term assets and demographic characteristics such as education,
 class or region.
 Fundamentally, the argument relies on status being shaped by two components.
 First is the stable component that stays unchanged in the short-term.
 This component includes long-established states e.g.
 education, occupation, ancestral social roles and long-term assets.
 The second component - the consumption that may offset the wide differences
 created by the first component - is what we measure as status consumption.
 The empirical difference between small assets purchased by the consumer
 and the long-term assets that serve the role of establishing the supposed
 long-term hierarchy is arrived at by assets that are transferred between
 generations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[separability and futility addressed as well] If a consumer can improve
 quality in food or in other commodity groups as her income rises and if
 status can be improved with consumption only through either non-durable
 or durable consumption, then it follows that the improvement and sustenance
 of quality across multiple commodity groups would carry more status among
 those with the same asset-ownership levels.
 The segmentation of quality is key to our view of status consumption -
 which we measured as high-quality consumption.
 Such a view of quality does not benefit from the implicit assumption of
 separability implied by the futility status consumptin.
 More pariticuarly, the assumption that visible items are of no utility
 other than signaling also implies that the utility from visible consumption
 is additively separable (see Ireland or Hopkins-Kornienko).
 Interpreting status consumption as high quality in commodities forgoes
 this assumption and therefore requires us to follow the more stringent
 conditions of separability.
 Simply put, the substitution between all items of higher quality cannot
 be argued for in the same way as one may argue for substitution (and thus
 aggregation) among visible goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our empirical assessment is simplified by the fact that not all commodities
 are dominate by quality.
 Since most consumers in a developing country such as Tanzania have consumption
 only on food, the differences in quality can be ignored for the expenditure
 in categories when such as household goods or transport where the respective
 assets have already been considered.
 In the various expenditure categories, therefore, we consider quality of
 non-durable consumption only in categories that are not dominated by assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Quality Measurement] As log the status-benefit from an item is priced in
 the market, viewing status as a combination of long-term ecocnomist standing
 implied by assets and the high relative-quality implies that comparison
 of quality (beers, meats, etc.) against the longer-term circumstances (household
 characteristics related to her needs and long-term economic standing) provides
 us an overview of the status-related consumption in the economy.
 In the analysis that follows, we employ compare the quality in four commodity
 cateogries - food, energy, transport and household - against the needs
 units (the number of family members adjusted for age) and the long-term
 socio-economic standing (measure with transferable assets) of the consumer.
 Here, the needs of the consumers are proxied by the number of members (age-adju
sted) in the household (and other available scales), quality is measured
 with the quantity consumed of high vs low-price variants of the commodity.
 We are interested in quality variation in food and energy commodities whereas
 the quality variation is ignored for household and transport categories
 except for what is implied by the assets in the consumption categories
 (household and transport).
 For food and energy, quality is measured with the quantity consumed of
 the food items and the market-prices of the item.
 With the AIDS formulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for this model of quality, the scale of consumer needs appears as a control
 variable in the AIDS budget share equations whereas the quality-choices
 appear as dependent variables in the equations (along with the budget shares
 for every commodity).

\begin_layout Standard
[Arguing for quality] The focus on quality in non-durable consumption serves
 to reduce the subjective judgments from the classification of visible items.
 Status - which motivates conspicuous consumption - is a complex social
 psychological phenomenon and thus one cannot rule out a subjective judgment
 in deciding whether an item is a status good or not.
 For example, if one were to rely only on whether an item can be afforded
 by the rich - then electricity, being used by a small and rich part of
 the population in a sub-Saharan African country like Tanzania, may appear
 to be a status good - at par with weddings (which are a clearer way of
 indicating status).
 But whether the same amount of money spent on weddings enhances status
 more than when it's spent on electricity is a far more difficult question
 to answer.
 Similarly, one could argue that buying clothes indicates higher status
 and go on to record the consumption on clothes as conspicuous consumption.
 But without observing the effect that getting electricity in the house
 or moving to a bigger house may have on a consumer's long-term utility
 and the perceived status, we cannot assume a significant status-benefit
 to the consumer from expenditure on clothing - since the possibility that
 those spending on recently installed electricity or a newly built house
 may actually be cutting down on clothing expenditure while deriving status
 from electricity or house ownership cannot be ruled out.
 To solve these fundamental issues, the literature on conspicuous consumption
 has often proceeded with a snapshot consumer poll that obtains the appropriate
 classification directly from the consumer.
 However, drawing inferences on long-term consumer behaviour from such analyses
 still remains a challenge due to the cross-sectional nature of such surveys.
 Further, status goods are indeed hardly static - as the demand for newly
 introduced items - e.g.
 a smart-phone or a TV - changes quickly.
 The types of status items one may wish to model (e.g.
 snob / bandwagon depending on whether the consumer wants to separate herself
 from others with the item or catches-up with those around her) are subject
 to change as the consumer incomes increase over time and the markets evolve
 to address consumer needs by launching cheaper substitutes etc..
 We use the estimate of status value from the non-durable consumption quality
 - which combined with the long-term assets - tracks the status derived
 from consumption.
 Instead of attempting to find the criteria for separating status-items
 from bare-necessities, we view status consumption as the consumer's short-term
 needs (i.e.
 quality or expensive non-durable consumption - henceforth referred to as
 ENDC) as opposed to her long-term needs that are fulfilled with the longer
 term socio-economic standing (e.g.
 with skills, occupation, family wealth etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Focus is both on rise prices and long-term choices] Our focus there is
 on quality food and energy relative to the assets owned by the consumer
 to understand the choice the consumers face in an environment of rising
 prices, incomes and urban development.
 The measure of food quality is based on the price of items within food
 categories (carbs, protein, fat etc.) while the measure of energy quality
 is based on whether the consumers used electricity or cheaper variants
 e.g.
 kerosene.
 Since a significant portion of the consumer income is spent on food and
 energy in the developing countries, the quality in food and energy captures
 the non-durable consumption above the basic needs imposed by the number
 of family members against the assets owned by the consumer.
 This non-durable consumption is where any status indication not evident
 from long-term assets must arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[ECONOMETRIC METHOD] The environment of severe inequalities in the developing
 economies and low possibilities of a transition in the consumers' longer-term
 circumstances (relative to the developed economies) means that the demand
 for quality in food and energy would be segmented across region, educational
 levels.
 The econometric methods we suggest attempt to explain these differences
 in quality across the population - given a certain household characteristics.
 In the current chapter, we attempt to address enhance the AIDS formulation
 to arrived a generic approach that we may apply to surveys from other economies
 - hoping to assimilate wide-ranging social observations on conspicuous
 consumption in the literature by using a general view of status across
 disparate social contexts.
 Here, the measurement of quality for food derives from the price-based
 view used in the literature.
 As quality is priced in the market, the quality for a commodity is indicated
 by the prices of the variants of a commodity.
 Here we find the market-prices of the variants of a commodity in the various
 regions of economy a necessary prerequisite due to the measurement errors
 implied by the unit-value method

 Using the prices from the Tanzanian LSMS data which we use for the current

 A methodology commonly used in demand studies for its robustness and simplicity
 is the AIDS model (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) - which we adapt for quality purpose (see McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 Based on PIGL approaches originally popularised by Barten

 and Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the method is simple to implement and yet readily conforms to the demand
 function restrictions.
 Still, AIDS implementations - like any other - are often ailed by the lack
 of observed market prices.
 An approach used quite often in empirical studies is to stick the implicit
 price-deflator (or unit-values) as prices in the AIDS regressions (see
 Tafere et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a recent implementation).
 While this may be the best way to proceed when market prices are not observed,
 their use can result in a severe measurement error since the quantities
 consumed by the consumer appear both in the dependent variable (as budget
 share's numerator) of the AIDS equations (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

) and in their control variables (as the denominator for unit-value used
 as price).
 Since observing market prices prevents such measurements errors (see the
 discussion by McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "McKelveyQuality2011"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Gibson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

[AIDS without Market Prices ] The lack of market prices in consumer surveys
 hardly makes the AIDS methodology less usable - just that the correction
 of such measurement errors is not always trivial (see Deaton

 of the Deaton method).
 AIDS method can be readily extended to other panel data scenarios.
 For example, the demographic variables in the AIDS model can be accommodated
 with the so-called demographic translation where the intercept

 in the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\alpha_{i}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_{ij}ln(p_{jh})+\beta_{i}ln(\frac{x_{h}}{P})$

 Similarly, the structural changes in the parameters over time is addressed
 with a dynamic AIDS formulation that is often based on differencing the
 budget shares over the time-periods (see Anderson and Blundell

 items - by incorporating an inverse Mills ratio into the AIDS regressions.
 This approach is particularly relevant for the analysis of quality since
 the consumption on high quality goods is often

 unit-values (obtained from the consumers' using an item) as prices on to
 those who don't consume the item.
 This is needed because the price isn't available when the indicator variable
 is zero i.e.
 when the consumers don't consumer an item

Measuring price-based quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the empirical studies on demand, the separability of demand for commodities
 that are grouped on the basis of their functional utility is often assumed.
 The separability is essentially a structure imposed on consumer demand
 by the researcher, but what make them ubiquitous in the demand literature
 is high-level interpretations they offer for consumer demand.
 A high-level interpretation is what makes a comparison with the past states
 of demand or the state of demand in other economies possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet these functional groups are largely ignored in the literature of status
 consumption.
 While measuring the consumption of
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conspicuous
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items, the demand elasticities are often estimated in the literature on
 conspicuous consumption using a collection of visible/conspicuous items
 as if they were a separate commodity group themselves.
 The literature justifies the use of a separate group of conspicuous items
 with the assumption that conspicuous consumption has a zero-utility in
 the usual (private) sense (see Ireland model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and Hopkins et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for the details of this argument).
 This approach makes sense only because the focus of such studies is the
 visible consumption itself.
 Thus the demand for the items that are known to be visible 
\shape italic
a priori 
\shape default
can be assumed to be also separable.
 On the other hand, working with consumption diary microdata in the developing
 (largely agrarian) countries, we find this assumption (henceforth referred
 to as the futility assumption) somewhat limiting.
 This is because in such markets, a high-quality item (priced higher in
 the market than its substitutes) is conspicuous not solely on grounds of
 its visibility - when most people don't have access to electricity in an
 economy, then having electricity as opposed to kerosene can also provide
 a status benefit (even though electricity is not a status or visible good
 
\shape italic
per se
\shape default
).
 Similarly, when most people take public-transport to work, having a car
 or taking a taxi also provides a status benefit and so on.
 To use a framework for status consumption in a developing economy, we must
 go beyond the idea of visible items.
 In the model we develop, therefore, no distinction of private vs public/visible
 consumption is considered necessary as all items are potential signaling
 items.
 Because of how widespread the low-quality consumption may be, an item that
 is not so important from a visibility perspective (i.e.
 not futile) may still be relevant for status - which we see as a part of
 the consumer's long-term utility.
 This we argue is even more so the case in the developing world - where
 both the poverty levels and inequality are very high - and conspicuous
 consumption need not be futile in the usual sense at all.

[Using Market Prices]The literature on demand analysis often relies on exogenous
 price observations for the consumer's basket.
 The prices observed in the market embody how the market, subject to supply
 pressures both i) addresses the needs of the consumers and ii) prices the
 differences in quality variants of the same commodity to the consumers.
 Despite market-observed prices being of a central importance to the demand
 analysis, it is only recently that the detailed prices observed in the
 market are made available in micro-data surveys.
 Arguing that market prices are key to an understanding of quality, we enhance
 a typical demand analysis to include the quality variation within commodities,
 the needs faced by the consumer and other household characteristics such
 as income and social-economic standing.

, we use a quality metric that measures the segmentation of quality in the
 population given a set of functionally separable commodity groups.
 We do not rely on analysis of visible items alone whose demand needs to
 be considered as if they were a weakly separable group by themselves.
 To avoid confusion of terms in the future discussion on items and quality,
 we use the nomenclature provided by Cramer

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Limitations] As we don't use the futility assumption, we do not assume
 that the high quality items from different commodity groups are not meant
 to be interchangeable with each other as such.
 The set of high-quality items in commodities thus do not need to be the
 same as the set of visible items in a consumer basket.
 While expensive meats and beverages may not be as visible as cosmetics,
 the higher quality they carry is of interest to our measure of quality
 even though an aggregate measure of quality arrived at by substitution
 among high-quality items across various commodity groups is not feasible.
 The claims for separability of 
\shape italic
all 
\shape default
high-quality items are thus improper.
 For example, even though kobe beef cannot be substituted with luxury travel
 as such, a high standard of life can be indicated by either or both of
 them without necessarily a separable functionality utility that aggregates
 into an overall quality.
 Therefore, our approach only gauges how consumers put some weight on higher-qua
lity within each commodity group without examining how quality may be budgeted
 for by the consumer within the non-overlapping commodity groups.
 In other words, no attempts are made to understand how consumers may purchase
 a desired amount of (overall) quality.
 It is the variation in high-quality consumption across the population that
 motivates our analysis of the status-related consumption in the context
 of the developing economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As quality cannot be aggregated from across commodity groups, the econometric
 methods we develop employ a vector of quality metrics for every commodity
 group i.e.
 a vector 
\begin_inset Formula ${\nu_{G\in\mathscr{{G}}}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is a commodity group 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 is the set of all commodities so that the representative consumer can prefer
 higher quality in one group 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{1}$
\end_inset

 over that in the another 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The quality metric in each group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is calculated using the local prices of the goods within that commodity.
 More simply put, a consumer who buys more of the high-priced item within
 a commodity group is viewed as consuming higher quality of that commodity.
 The econometric methods then attempt to view both how the demand for quality
 is distributed across the population and how it varies in response to change
 in prices.
 The use of a commodity aggregate for quality means imposes the restriction
 of a constant relative price structure (

Notice that no quality-related inferences can be drawn without an explicit
 measure of quality in the utility.
 Consider for example the commonly used Stone-Geary utility for all commodity
 groups.
 The indirect utility function with the optimisation of Stone-Geary direct
 utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum\beta_{i}log(q_{i}+\gamma_{i})$

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\beta_{i}=1$

 under the conditions

\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $u\equiv\psi(x,p)=\sum\beta_{i}log(x\beta_{i}/p_{i}+\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 This uses the first-order conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $L=u-\lambda(x-p\cdot q)=\sum\beta_{i}log(q_{i}+\gamma_{i})-\lambda(x-p\cdot q)$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}=0\Rightarrow\frac{\beta_{i}}{q_{i}}=\lambda p_{i}\forall i\in[1,n]$

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}=\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}x$
\end_inset

 .
 As long we can assume that a consumer observes the price index of a commodity
 (rather than individual prices), the indirect utility does not differentiate
 between an increase in the price-index of the commodity (whose multiple
 variants are observed) and the switch to a better quality item by the consumer.
 This would be a serious issue in empirical analyses - in addition to the
 usual limitations of additive utility - when a higher quality is more expensive
 than less qualitt as the increase in the price-index of an item is not
 differentiated from the consumer reducing the quantity consumed of the
 item.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus, the quantities consumed for two (or more) items within a commodity
 (e.g.
 tea and carbonated drinks under beverages that can be interchanged by the
 consumer) are viewed as an aggregate-quantity of a composite good (i.e.
 beverages) along with the value consumed of a quality metric (proportion
 of tea and carbonated drinks).
 In other words, the quantity-price tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1},p_{1}),(q_{2},p_{2}),(q_{3},p_{3})...$
\end_inset

 within a commodity could be expressed as a quantity and quality pair for
 a commodity aggregate - 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q_{G},P_{G}),(\nu_{G},p_{\nu_{G}})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G},Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 are prices and quantity consumed for a composite commodity while 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{G}$
\end_inset

 represents the quality of the commodity - treated as a separate good.
 The quantity and quality pair of goods correspond to the real quantities
 consumed for several items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Simplification] To identify the commodity aggeregate over which the quality
 measure is aggregate over, we also make use of a simplication so that not
 all variation in quality is considered of importance to the consumer optimising
 status and needs.
 More specifically, the varition quality is ignored for a particular commodity
 category if the there are long-term assets that dominate the effect on
 status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label

Both quantity and quality in a commodity aggregate matter to the consumer
 iff there are no long-term assets associated with the aggregate.

For example, having a car and hiring a limousine taxi in the transport commodity

 The assumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

caps "false"

\end_inset

 implies a simplified context where only one of i) non-durable consumption
 and ii) long-term assets in the commodity group matter to the consumer.
 Therefore, in the tranport commodity group, only either of i) car ownership
 or ii) expensive-taxi-rides matter to the consumer.
 In the consumption data for Tanzania, the empirical implications of this
 assumption are not serious and allow us to focus on quality variation only
 for commodities where assets do not play a role.
 More specifically, out of the four commodity aggregates energy, transport
 household and those associated with food (fruits-vegetables, non-fresh
 itemsetc.), only quality is considered for energy and food aggregates categories
 due the non-durable nature of their consumption.
 On the other hand, only quantity (i.e.
 the expenditure) is considered of importance for non-durable consumption
 in transport and household categories.
 As long as one may classify every commodity group as either dominated by
 long-term asset or not, there are only two ways a consumer can spend on
 quality - either by switching between the variants of a composite commodity
 (choosing higher or lower quality of a composite commodity where long-term
 assets do not exist) or spending more on an elementary commodity (where
 long-term assets dominate and quality variation doesn't exist) 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Recall that an elementary commodity is one where no quality variation is
 supposed to exist and higher quality can be achieved only through more
 purchase of the commodity.
 A composite commodity - on other hand - is a commodity where a sufficient
 quality variation exists and a consumer can use a mix of higher quality
 and lower-quality goods within the commodity.

 In other words, both elementary consumption and composite commodity consumption

Econometric Method

\begin_layout Standard
[Econometric Goals - Needs the same] Apart from the response to price changes
 using the above formulation, we are also interested in the effect of consumer
 needs and other household characteristics in the cross-section.
 In the scope of the current chapter, the means of subsistence are considered
 the same for a wealthy and a destitute household and no distinction is
 drawn between the basic needs of a rich and a poor family (through their
 disparate educational needs etc.).
 To reiterate, the notion of status in the model comes only from the quality,
 the long-term assets and household characteristics.
 Notice also that due to the very definition of needs, the consumer cannot
 sacrifice needs in order to purchase quality.
 Thus for prices fixed, a rise in quality must come either from an increase
 in income or from change in circumstances.
 Likewise, a drop in quality must be due to change in circumstances (socio-econo
mic standing which we assess with a vector of occupation, education, region/loca
lity/neighborhood/assets) or addressing of more urgent needs.
 A consumer having undergone change in her long-term circumstances is thus
 treated as two consumers with different needs and/or long-term assets.
 In other words, with changes such as purchase of a long-term asset of education
al or occupational attainment, the consumers long-term habits of non-durable
 consumption quality would also undergo a change.

 readily lends itself to estimation of income and price elasticities (with
 respect to base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

) across a cross-section of household characteristics relevant for quality
 with an AIDS implementation.
 To recap, we use the price-based quality and quantity for food sub-categories
 - protein (meat, fish), fruits-vegetables, non-fresh food items (dry carbohydra
tes such as rice, wheat), complements (tea, coffee etc.) and densefoods (dense
 energy providing food as buns, pasta, flours) while using an indicator
 variable for energy that specifies whether the consumer uses electricity
 or not.
 The prices shown in Figure

 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The ownership of assets for transport and household which appears as the
 control variable in the AIDS regression is measured with the logarithm
 of the costs of the asset.
 Also, ignoring the quality variation for transport and household expenditure
 categories means that quality is not estimated for these categories.

 The aggregation also circumvents the issue of non-consumption since it
 is much less likely for no items to be consumed within a commodity group

 No correction related to non-consumption - as used in the Heien-Well method

is simply the minimum price of the goods within the commodity group.
 Here, only the locally observed market prices (at the district level) rather
 than the unit-value (estimated by averaging expenditure over a locality)
 for goods within a commodity aggregate are used for the base-price computation
 (see Details in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The expenditure on household and transportation commodity groups - on the
 other hand - are treated as if they were (each) just one commodity i.e.
 no quality differences are observed in the non-durable consumption within
 the commodity group.
 Therefore, the sum of expenditure clothing, toilet rolls and other houeshold
 goods appear as part of the quantity in the AIDS system of equation.
 As market -prices are not recorded for these items in the survery, the
 CPI (base year 2010) for household goods and transportation as prices in
 the respective budget share regressions for household and transportation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Caveats] Evidently, the analysis of quality across food and energy based
 on commodity aggregates also imposes some restrictions due to the very
 nature of aggregation over various commodities based on their prices.
 More particularly, both the separability assumptions and the price-based
 assessment of quality are decision made by the researcher rather than the
 consumer (see Nelson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for this clarification).
 Take for example, the protein commodity group - where as such there may
 no reason to think that being slightly more costly makes goat-meat of higher
 quality - in a sense perceived by the consumer - than beef.
 At time same time however, quality differences are evident if the price
 differences are larger - e.g.
 with the choice of pulses over chicken.
 The aggregated view of quality similarly might be argued as averaging the
 substitutions between items that are of interest in their own right.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address this particular concern with aggregation, we provide comparison
 with an item-wised view of elasticities and explain the limitations for
 aggregation of quality.
 The results from an item-wise approach with a more detailed sense of elasticiti
es using the Heien-Wells approach are presented in Appendix III.
 We prefer the quality-aggregated view as it provides more insights into
 variation in quality - given our focus on the segregation of quality across
 the segments of the population.
 However, it is also worth clarifying that the aggregation approve assumes
 a substitution between two items only as long as they belong to the same
 commodity group
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An approach that strictly satisfies this property too strictly is

\end_inset

simple-repackaging

\end_inset

 method.
 The method assumes a perfect substitution across goods in a commodity group
 so that a higher quality product can be viewed in terms of a lower quality
 product.
 We find the perfect substitution assumption less useful when the goods
 within the commodity vary widely in quality (or fundamental other characteristi
cs).
 As an example, the demand of a better good in a commodity group as a multiple
 of the worse good may be plausible for meat/food - but considering electricity
 in terms of coal into one aggregate is far less plausible (see the discussion
 on consumer indices in Fisher-Shell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 on how this issue could be remedied).
 At the consumer's level, the substitution between kerosene and electricity
 is not as straightforward as amongst the quality variants of protein -
 so while a metric for quality does make sense in a setting where a mixture
 of high and low quality items are consumed (e.g.
 in food) it fails to account for quality differences when choices vary
 widely.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 The commonly used two-state budgeting approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is not used - i.e.
 substitution is not considered for high-quality items from across commodity
 group - due to the rather stringent requirement of the relative demand
 between two items in any two different categories to change only in response
 to the total expenditure.
 In other words, the response to price changes and total expenditure changes
 must use the same channels of communication in the commodity tree
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer,StrotzUtilityTree1957"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Evidently, the condition cannot be guaranteed when there is a substitution
 of quality from across the commodity groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Two-state budgeting substantiation] To illustrate the issue with aggregating
 quality from across commodity groups in a two-state budgeting model with
 an example, consider a two-group world of food and energy - within which
 we have items : beef-bread-milk and electricity-kerosene-charcoal respectively.
 If consumers don't cut back on quality in one group to gain quality in
 another, the items - food and energy - can be assumed (and tested empirically)
 to be separable groups.
 Therefore, it is plausible for a consumer to allocate some money 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 on food and energy respectively in the first-stage (based on her knowledge
 of the price-indices for food and energy).
 Once the expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 are fixed, the (representative) consumer can subsequently decide in the
 second-state how much of kerosene or electricity to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{E}$
\end_inset

 and how much beef or bread to buy with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Individual prices of every item within the category would decide which
 food varieties and which energy sources are to be purchased.
 Under the conditions of weak separability, it is implied that cheaper bread
 (price-sensitivity for bread consumption) would not make a consumer choose
 a more expensive fuel (price-sensitivity for electricity, charcoal etc.
 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for details on the theory).
 This condition - however - falls apart if we introduce the substitution
 for quality across the commodity groups.
 More particularly, if we assume that a consumer gets quality utility from
 using electricity and from eating beef interchangeably, then having decided
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{F},x_{E}$
\end_inset

 does not guarantee that she would not switch to more consumption on electricity
 if kobe beef becomes cheaper.
 This is because overall quality - due to our assumption - is aggregated
 from across the commodity groups.
 Thus unlike in the case of energy and food without quality substitution
 across commodity-groups, cheaper food can be compensated with the switch
 to electricity.
 Since price sensitivities and total expenditure sensitivities don't follow
 the same channel of communication in the two-state budgeting tree, the
 necessary condition for two-stage separability is not met (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhilipsAppliedCons,DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sections that follow, we use the data on possession of assets in
 the Tanzanian consumption microdata to seek differences in the quality
 habits in the different asset ownership bands (and other characteristics).
 For consumption of quality, the commodity groups: food, energy, household
 and transport are identified.
 The quality of protein, carbohydrates, beverages etc.
 - each of which is treated as a composite good - are measured with the
 metric presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:QualityMeasure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, household and transport are treated as elementary goods
 (i.e.
 no quality variation is assumed and only the cost of the items is considered).
 The cross-price effects for the items in the survey for 2010, 2012 and
 2014 are also presented to provide an insight into how prices of non-food
 items may have an effect on food quality and vice versa.

With recent economic growth and a history of nationalization, Tanzania serves
 as a case-study of consumer markets in the developing sub-Saharan Africa.
 In more recent times, since the investments from South Africa and Western
 countries have significantly expanded in the country, the trends of urbanisatio
n are evident in the consumption data.
 The data we use for our analysis is from the Living Standard Measurement
 Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World Bank - for year 2010, 2012 and 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The survey LSMS records past expenditure with diary and recall methods.
 The diary method is used for food items while other purchases are recorded
 as weekly, monthly and yearly recalls.
 Evidently, the food expenditure are recorded with a greater level of detail
 than other expenditures.
 We present the summary statistics from the microdata for 2010 (base year)
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the advantages of using commodity aggregates over an item-wise analysis
 is that it avoids the measurement errors in quality arising out of combining
 recall and diary items.
 As detailed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the commodity aggregates over which quality is evaluated both in the functiona
l sense and the price-movement sense.
 The functional category is one where there is a sufficient degree of substituti
on possible amongst its members.
 As an example, goat and beef are put under the same group - but not with
 tea - as there is little sense in substitution between tea and meat.
 The price movements over years are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Due to reasons cited in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:QualityMeasure"

\end_inset

, the items of high quality are not explored as a separate category by themselve
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we are interested in how sparsely some items are consumed, we are
 careful not to interpret the absence of an item in the recall record for
 a household as the item not being used by the household.
 This is because not all items in the recall diary are recorded at the same
 frequency - some items in the survey are recorded as they're recalled from
 a month before the interview - while others may be recalled from the year
 before the interview.
 Similarly, the an interpretation of the differences in the budget share
 over snapshots (2010, 2012 and 2014) for a particular household and item
 cannot be interpreted as a consumption pattern of a household since we

 the survey (2010, 2012 and 2014).
 For example, with the case of electricity usage, we find that the survey

While survey does not include the data on tribal/social identities of the
 participants, other proxies that may be correlated with social identities
 (e.g.
 language spoken, regional origin etc.) that are available at the village
 or equivalent level in the survey.
 Of particular interest are the education, urban residence and income levels
 - from where we derive occupational and education ranks to be used in the
 econometric analysis.

 The occupation ranks are derived from the income data in the survey.
 There are two reasons why we use income data through the occupation ranks
 instead of using it directly in the analyses.
 First, the income data is available for only around 30% of the households
 which we have diary data for.
 Second, due to the large informal sector in the country, having two jobs
 and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not uncommon and would
 lead to biases in the use of household income.

The market observed prices available in the survey facilitate a comparison

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Since the market-observed prices are recorded at every district level,
 the prices observed at the district are matched with every household based
 on the district the household is located.
 The box plots for market observed prices (per standard unit that are liters
 or kilograms) are shown in Figure

 Notice that the variation in prices for meat and seafood seem higher than
 those in the prices of the rest of the food items.
 Similarly, processed foods as well as energy sources (kerosene) seem relatively
 high in price compared to other food items.
 That the consumers in rural districts are not exposed to prices of processed
 foods and exotic meats must be considered while considering the variation
 in quality.

[Matching process] We now describe the process of matching the market prices
 for the items consumed by a household in more detail.
 As noted before, out of the food, energy, transport and household commodity
 groups, we only consider quality differences in food and energy subgroups
 - whereas the other commodity groups are viewed as groups where asset possessio
n (or ownership of long-term durable goods) matters more than quality variation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prices observed in the market drive our measure of quality and the later
 discussion of cross-price effects.
 Since we don't use price-deflators in our analysis (due to measurement
 errors that arise with quantity being in both in the denominator of the
 control variables and in the numerator of the dependent variable), a matching
 of prices of the items observed in the market (identified by region and
 district) with the prices of the items purchased by the consumer (with
 known region and district) is of key importance to our analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LSMS Tanzania surveys record the prices observed in the markets spread across
 all regions in the country.
 These prices are available for items in the food and energy commodity groups.
 The items within these commodities are grouped according to the 
\shape italic

 relative structure of the price time-series observed from 2008 to 2014
 shown in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To classify the goods based on the movement of their prices, we gather the
 market prices for the relevant items during the survey periods (2010, 2012
 and 2014).
 Following is a list of issues that were resolved to obtain the price data
 to be used for subsequent classification of items and matching with consumption
 microdata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A lot of items in the year 2008 were recorded with the unit as pieces/"idadi"
 (e.g.
 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These items were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,
 pulses, peanuts, coconut, onion, greens, dried_canned_veg, banana_ripe,
 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk items where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the items where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pieces
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in order to determine the price-structure that aids the classification
 of food groups (with similar price-structure).
 See Figure

\end_inset

 for the prices observed from 2008 to 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A few outlier price observations (<5%) are rejected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
While a household in the LSMS consumption data is identified down to the
 village and enumeration area level - we do not expect the surveys to record
 market-prices at every possible enumeration area and village.
 We thus associate a district level price to a household's consumed item.
 In other words, the price of an item consumed by a household is linked
 to all households in the same district where the household is located.
 We make no attempts to arrive at a price granularity lower than that of
 a district.
 When there are multiple price observations at the district level, we arrive
 a district-level price using a regression (discussed below).
 Further, when the prices are not available at the district levels, we use
 the regional averages (i.e.
 the next level of granularity available).
 For items such as electricity and gas that are limited to a few urban areas,
 we simply use the price at a national level

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The market-price observed for items are recorded in several units.
 To assimilate all the price data from across the quantities and regions,
 we run a regression of marked-price against quantity it was recorded for.
 The coefficients of the regression can thus provide us the price for an
 arbitrary quantity of the item.
 For example, if we had observed the marked prices of rice (let's say) for
 1 kg, 2kg, 5kg and 10kg in the market.
 A typical set of marked prices could be 4£, 7.5£, 18£ and 35£ respectively
 - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

 for the plot of these example prices.
 In this example as well as in the real-world, such unit-prices grow at
 a less than linear rate (see the unit-price corresponding to the quantities
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore a linear regression of 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 is the marked price of the item and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 the quantity consumed) is hardly appropriate.
 Instead, we use a quadratic expression to regress the unit-prices observed
 against the quantities they're recorded.
 Given this regression, the price of any arbitrary quantity can thus be
 obtained.
 What we need from the regression however, is merely the price of the unit-quant
ity (e.g.
 the price per kg for rice in the current example) rather than matching
 the appropriate marked price with the quantity purchased by the consumer
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we were to really look for a perfect match for prices, then we should
 not only match the quantities consumed by the consumer with the prices
 recorded in the market but also the time of the household interview with
 that of the price recorded.
 This fine matching is both impractical (survey prices being hardly available
 at such fine levels of granularity) and unnecessary since our view of price
 is that of a value that is faced by a sufficiently large number of consumers
 in the survey.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The regression we use therefore is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 (assuming that the marked price is lower than a linear increase - see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

 - by a factor that itself decreases with increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $mp=aq-b/q$
\end_inset

).
 Since we use the price set 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

, the price to be used is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 for the regression: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta/q^{2}+c$
\end_inset

.
 This regression is run only when more than two prices are available.
 When the regression can't be used a simple median is used as the price
 for such cases
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This does not happen as frequently as one may imagine.
 For 2010, only 9 identified regions for just 6 items have less than three
 marked-prices available.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The price-inference is therefore a 2-stage process - in the first-stage
 we obtain prices for every district with the regression method.
 If there are no marked prices available in a district, we use the regional
 value of the price.
 For some items, the region-prices are not available for some regions.
 Here, the price from obtained by the regressions over the country is used
 for the item.
 The prices for some items whose consumption is relatively rare in the diary
 data (e.g.
 wild-birds and honey) are not available for any of the regions.
 Such items (e.g.
 alcohol) are ignored for the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the prices obtained after the above regression, we match the price
 for every commodity consumed by the household based on the district it
 is located in.
 Once we have the observed market prices for every item by every household,
 we can aggregate the costs across an arbitrary group of items and calculate
 quality for the group.
 Being driven by the conditions discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Discussion"

\end_inset

, the classification of items into groups is hardly arbitrary - we are guided
 both by separability and the constant relative price-structure assumption
 (i.e.
 first condition).
 Had we considered separability alone, the classification of all food-items
 within a food-group and kerosene-electricity into the energy group would
 have proven sufficient.
 But the structure of the price movement observed as the annual time series
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"

\end_inset

 for a plot of the average prices for every good) for every item is also
 relevant for our classification.
 Thus the sub-groups within food are created based on the correlated changes
 in price from 2008 until 2014.
 For example, the price changes for sugar and tea are more similar to each
 other they are to the changes in prices for rice or cooking-oil
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A clustering of regression coefficients was used to arrive at these groups.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We therefore put sugar and tea within a group complements and rice-cooking_oil
 within a group nonfresh (to indicate the comovement of prices).
 Similarly, within the food commodity we observe protein, fruitsveg, densefoods
 and nonfresh groups as the rest of the food-subgroups.
 For quality elasticities to make sense, the classification of commodity
 groups based on the market price-structure is essential due the composite
 commodity theorem restrictions (i.e.
 the constant relative price structure).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may argue that a selection bias is introduced when we use the national-avera
ges for some items and region averages for other.
 This could be a problem if the unavailability of regional averages occurred
 for a significant portion of price entries.
 However, since only about 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim4\%$
\end_inset

 of the total price observations have no regional averages (only a few items
 suffer with the issue), the bias thus introduced would be rather insignificant.
 Another issue could be taken with our grouping of commodities - as it relies
 on the annual time-series data.
 It is indeed possible that the price of some items may be more volatile
 than the others - and thus the volatility being ignored in the annual time
 series data would bring some bias.
 But since we combine the household log diary with the recall diary (which
 is recorded on a monthly or yearly basis), a finer time-series for prices
 is not enough to address this issue.
 Such a bias could be alleviated only through finer price data

The aggregation into commodities also allows us as an intermediate step
 in merging data from recall and diary methods.
 As items are often recorded with more details for the diary items than
 for the recall items (the types of phones, clothes purchased by the consumers
 are hardly recorded in the surveys for example), viewing diary data at
 a higher (aggregated) level - i.e.
 at a coarser granularity that matches that of the recall methods - allows
 us to have a combined view of data from recall and diary methods.
 Further, the inclusion of assets and the expenditure data from recall methods
 on household-transportation further helps us explain how the expenditure
 on quality differs across various commodity groups within the population.

Since we view the accumulated assets worth as the household characteristics
 (i.e.
 as a part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:utility"

\end_inset

), the assets owned for the two groups - household and transport - are also
 used in the AIDS SUR equations i.e.
 the variable 
\family typewriter
all_assets_mtm
\family default
 (which is the logarithm of total cost that the asset would reportedly sell
 for if it were to be sold at the time of the interview).
 We also use the variable 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
(which indicates whether the household has access to electricity or not)
 in place of a quality metric for energy.
 Other formulations discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:RobustnessChecks"

\end_inset

 may use control variables based on the ownership of the types of assets
 - namely 
\family typewriter
electric_assets_mtm
\family default
 (the logarithm of total cost of electrical assets - costs being what the
 asset woulds reportedly sell for if they were to be sold at the time of
 the interview), 
\family typewriter

\family default
 (the logarithm of total cost of land or the house that they would reportedly
 sell for if they were to be sold at the time of the interview) and

 either start with q- or with qV-.
 The columns starting with q- indicate the budget shares (

\end_inset

) that are used as the dependent variables in AIDS regressions (see Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AIDS_quality_w"

\end_inset

 ) and the columns starting with qV- indicate the logarithm of the quality
 metric as the dependent variable (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ V$
\end_inset

 in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AIDS_quality_lnV"

\end_inset

).
 As explained earlier in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Discussion"

\end_inset

, we use an indicator variable 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
(see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsAllassets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) for whether the consumer uses electricity or not instead of a quality
 metric for energy in the intercept of the AIDS equations.
 This is due to the wide differences in the characteristics of goods (kerosene,
 electricity and charcoal) within the energy commodity.
 In an alternate formulation in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:RobustnessChecks"

\end_inset

, a variable showing the total cost of electric assets is used as one of
 the household characteristics in lieu of the 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ V$
\end_inset

 equations are used only for the food commodity group.
 Using the classification based on prices and functionality, the commodities
 chosen within the food group are - densefoods, non-fresh, fruits-veg, protein
 and complements (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Groups"

\end_inset

 all the goods that belong to these commodity groups).
 Since quality measure is not used for energy, household and transport no
 quality equations are needed for these commodity.
 The total number of equations to estimate with the SUR is therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times5+3\times1=13$
\end_inset

.
 The results obtained from the SUR that are shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsAllassets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 suggest the relevance of asset ownership in the demand for non-durable
 items - their quality in particular.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer habits do seem to be influenced by the financial standing of
 the consumer that we have attempted to gauge with the occupation rank and
 assets owned by the consumers.
 The life-style differences that we observe in non-durable consumption -
 with respect to the quality of items (indicated with variables starting
 with 
\family typewriter
qV
\family default
-) do seem associated with household characteristics related to the long-term
 economic standing (and particularly on whether they use electricity or
 not).
 Here, it is worth differentiating between the effect that ownership of
 assets has on quality vs the effect of total expenditure
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The literature often uses total expenditure as a measure of permanent income.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Those with electrical assets (the logarithm of whose total cost is used
 as the control variable) tend to spend more on fruits-veg quality.
 With higher expenditure (
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
), the quality of non-fresh increases but the quality of fruits-veg decreases.
 Those with a stronger long-term economist standing spend relatively less
 on quality of protein and transport (public_transport, car maintenance
 etc.) - which are commodities where those who have electricity seem to spend
 more.
 It seems that just starting to use electricity (but not having lots of
 electric assets) can increase the quality of protein consumed for the average
 consumer (see the effect of the 
\family typewriter
has_electric
\family default
 variable in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsSubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running another SUR with assets split into electrical, household and transport
 assets confirm the same results (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsSubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Here, as one would expect, the consumption on energy is high for electricity
 users due to the high prices of electricity in Tanzania.
 The owners of electrical assets also consume more fruits-veg quality and
 have more expenditure on household products.
 Here too, slightly lower fruitsveg quality is associated total expenditure
 (
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
).
 While those with more assets spend less on some food quality categories,
 they do spend more on the household-related non-durable consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variable 
\family typewriter
expensive_region
\family default
 is significant for non-fresh quality, protein quality, household commodity
 group, transport commodity group and the energy commodity group.
 Within urban areas, having electricity is associated with higher protein
 and fruits-veg quality.
 The urban consumers may have less overall assets compared to their counterparts
 in rural areas but they spend more on quality on protein and fruits-veg
 (less on dense-foods and household asset).
 The above observations suggest the life-style differences in the densely
 populated urban areas brought about by availability of industrial goods.

Robustness Checks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure that the relevance of high asset ownership in differences of quality
 is a robust observation, we rerun the SUR with an aggregated food category.
 This formulation no longer uses the price-based groups and views all food-subca
tegories as one food group
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The quality is still calculated based on the prices.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 Using the CPI of food basket as prices (just the way transport CPI and
 household CPI are used) the above analysis is repeated with food, energy,
 transport and household as separable categories.
 In the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsFoodCPIAllAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{resultsFoodCPISubAssets}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, a preference for higher quality for electricity users and household asset
 owners is observed when we use a food aggregate (a collection of the subcategor
ies).
 Food quality increases with total expenditure and with acquisition of household
 assets.
 As one would expect, transport costs are higher in the urban areas.
 The non-durable expenditure on household items and overall food quality
 both decrease for urban areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a further test of the robustness of results, we calculate the food-quality
 using the market-provided prices.
 More specifically, the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 we have used diary-costs on goods as reported by the consumer.
 However, the LSMS records this cost only from the items that were consumed
 from purchases in the last week.
 If a consumer didn't purchase anything in the past week, there would only
 be quantities consumed (not costs) that would be reported for the consumer
 in the diary.
 Since we have the market-prices available, another way to calculate costs,
 budget-shares and quality would be to infer costs as the multiple of market-pri
ces from the quantities consumed in the past week (which is reported for
 all consumers regardless of whether they had purchased something in the
 last week or not).
 Recalculating quality and budget shares still shows us the same economic
 and statistical significance (results available on request) of electricity
 and household assets in quality of fruitsveg, proteins and other subcategories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth reiterating that the differences in quality should be seen as
 more than just response to high prices in the urban areas.
 As our quality metric is derived from locally available prices (the base
 price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 can be different in every district), it already accounts for regional differenc
es in prices.
 One possible explanation is that the focus on industrial goods and meat
 categories is stronger in urban areas and is maintained as consumer habits.
 A comparison of quality differences amongst the population in other countries
 could verify this argument i.e.
 if quality differences for a certain commodity groups are found significant
 with respect to the long-term socio-economic standing of the consumer in
 other markets.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The availability of market-prices and the details on household characteristics
 allow us to understand the factors that may cause the differences in the
 consumer baskets (i.e.
 what we refer to as the supply-side concerns) and influence consumption
 of quality - whose role in status consumption we explore in the current
 chapter.
 The differences in the consumer baskets observed across an unevenly developing
 economy is necessary before one may draw conclusions about high-quality
 consumption in the economy.
\end_layout

Given the differences in consumer baskets for the urban and rural consumer,
 it is hardly surprising that those in the urban areas spend differently
 on certain non-durable items.
 Nevertheless, the sustained quality differences for meat and fresh goods
 for urban consumers indicate a peculiar environmental difference in the
 urban areas - particularly sensitive to the distribution of electricity
 and availability of public transport.
 We find that it is not just that those with higher asset worth tend to
 buy more - but the quality purchased for a few categories always appears
 higher (lower) for the consumers who own medium-cost assets and lower (higher)
 for consumers who don't.

\begin_layout Standard
Within the urban areas, the households that don't own assets would benefit
 from spending more on industrial goods than an equivalent consumer in the
 rural area who does not face the same choice of industrial goods.
 Those who own more assets in the rural areas may not feel the status competitio
ns the way the asset owning consumer in an urban area would.
 In other words, the consumer in the urban areas may be willing to sacrifice
 quality in one group to avail it in another - in a way that the rural consumer
 cannot.
 The role of long-term assets and residence is thus key in the discussion
 of status consumption.
 The segmentation of quality based on the long-term economic standing need
 not be due to a fundamental shift in demand for quality in the urban areas
 - but implied (in food or in other non-durable commodities) by pricier
 meats or electrical items available to the urban food consumer that may
 let her deprioritse the quality in other commodities.

[Assets are also consumption] If I already consider assets in consumption,
 then this analysis is invalid.
 We are not saying that certain people are more likely to own cars.
 We're saying that the different observed quality is segmentated rather
 than compensated - and certain qualities are high in certain areas - the
 role of heterogeneity of quality is dominant.

\begin_layout Standard
The relatively higher consumption on household items for those with better
 occupations indicates that very little of evidence of pecuniary emulation
 in the data.
 The choice for quality is significantly influenced by the owned long-term
 assets - which along with the commodity quality chosen drive the perception
 of status in the model.
 There are more reasons to consider these differences in the developing
 countries where inequalities are wider.
 Further, if it is possible to model the acquisition of assets over time,
 an intertemporal setting could enhance our understanding of how quality
 of expenditure changes over time - allowing us to provide more robust insights
 on how long-term utility inclusive of status is indicated through consumption.

There are two things we can conclude - for the original question whether
 the consumption is different - we do find significant differences.
 But second we also find extreme segmentation of quality goods.

Historical developments in sub-Saharan Africa 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The landscape of the political history of sub-Saharan African is dominated
 by anti-colonial movements in the past century.
 While it seems natural to hope for Adam Smith's principles to take hold
 in the nascent economies of the newly formed republics in the sub-Saharan
 Africa, neither the economic development nor the collective defense of
 nationalistic interests have followed a path similar to that of the developed
 world.
 The industrial class in the African countries is still poor in absolute
 terms and the problems of extreme poverty have remained largely unresolved
 in the large swathes of sub-Saharan Africa.
 The administrative successes and stability of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before.
 The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires,
 for example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries
 when compared to the administrative units (much as the political boundaries
 themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The processes of decolonization - which started in the late last century
 - have encompassed the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia
 and Africa aspiring to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 (often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike) their reach and success has been limited.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Nigeria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The access to education is varied in Nigeria - because of the different
 levels of successes missionary education had in Nigeria.
 This seems to have created regional disparities in the current education
 levels between the northern and southern parts of Nigeria.
 More particularly, the north has had a higher Islamic influence and the
 uniformity desired by the post-colonial government had had some initial
 challenges.
 On one hand, the market forces seemed to have had been left relatively
 untouched at the start of the republic (due in part to the imperial regime
 which relied on participation from native authorities).
 On the other hand, the continuation of farming-based wage labour which
 continued well into the post-colonial era meant that the advantage did
 not significantly improve the economic conditions.
 At a time when the movements of African socialism in Nigeria picked up
 their momentum, the power of merchant class was further limited.
 Despite the presence of quite few multi-national corporations having developed
 in the economy, the presence of a strong business sector stills appears
 hampered - as the majority of these corporations are state-backed monopolies.
 The large informal sector is therefore yet to replaced with a middle class
 of workers with significant purchasing power

.
 That said, while the recent development in the economy may not have created
 a sufficient base for entrepreneurs, they do seem to have revived a focus
 on education and expanded the market for industrial goods.
 An average of 42% workforce in Nigeria have secondary education or higher,
 upto 28% of those in mere survival activities have a secondary school certifica
te and 12% have post-secondary qualifications

Tanzania 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Given its engagement in the liberation movements in Mozambique in 1974 and
 the faith in planned economy inculcated by Nyrere, it would not be inaccurate
 to consider Tanzania the epicentre of the African socialism.
 But once the political independence was achieved in Tanzania, the membership
 of nationalist parties declined and the separation of civil service from
 political institutions became less of a priority.
 The faith in socialist planning under the leadership of Nyrere meant that
 the reduction of private sector did not experience much opposition.
 With a lack of support from its workers and a ban on producer-consumer
 societies, the socialist model seemed to have had some inconsistencies.
 In the decades after the independence, the industrial sector continued
 to suffer because of import subsidies.
 An import substituting industrialization (ISI) led to oversubsidizing when
 the need to prevent mass starvation called for an adjustment to capital
 flows.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and the use of a capital-intensive technology
 caused the oversubsidizing to spread further across other sectors.
 Subsequently, an over-reliance on capital for development resulted in decline
 of the industrial capacity utilization

 - many arguing that the workforce had moved to a subsistence through cultivatio
n approach.
 In its modern economy, only the public officials have had the advantage
 of becoming entrepreneurs.
 Even though imports could have improved the Tanzanian exchange rate - the
 problems around corruption have always posed limitations to trade reforms
 in Tanzania (particularly in the energy sector)

 With state regulated economy having had no ways to expand, the growth of
 parallel economy has been unavoidable - leaving a disconnect between the
 parallel markets and a protectionist trade policy.
 More recently, the firms from South Africa and China have increasingly
 participated in Tanzania while the training programs for the local labour
 and the plans to develop local infrastructure languish.
 The conflicts between the miners and SA migrant labour are common - while
 many Tanzanians are sent to South Africa for training

Having achieved independence from Portugal in 1975, the competition between

The political power is influenced by many ethnicities in Kenya and the clan
 dynamics is of high importance.
 Due to this reason, the policy changes can quickly develop into ethnic
 conflicts.
 For example, when resettlement was attempted under Kenyatta's leadership,
 the discontent was predominantly from non-

 Other attempts at nationalization - e.g.
 taking control of foods sales or establishment of purchase centres - have
 met with similar confrontations.

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enu:diary_scaling"

\end_inset

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 The LSMS survey records the quantities for food items - even if they were
 not purchased in the past week.
 But for other non-food items (such as soap, skin creams whose quantities
 are not recorded in the survey) are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families as well.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption.
 To verify that this not a significant issue, we first test if such stocking
 (quantities purchased) may be uniform in all region in the country.
 We then test the significance of household factors that may affect long-term
 storage (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) of the purchased item.
 Observing the quantity purchased on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure on all items 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we use a difference-in-means analysis to confirm the low effect of travel-cost
s on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{e}{x})$
\end_inset

 and conclude that stockpiling is not significant.
 It turns out that the number of family members is a far more significant
 factor for large purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wide categories of energy, transport and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.

Cross-sectional AIDS with adjustment for non-consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step with the selection approach is a probit where the dependent
 variable is an indicator variable that is unity when the item is consumed
 and zero otherwise.
 The control variables used in the first-stage probit are the prices of
 the item and market-characteristics (region etc.
 - see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_probit"

\end_inset

) .
 The inverse-mills ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the
 Equation

 - see Heien-Wessells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) is then used as an instrument in the AIDS regressions(see Equation

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above item-wise analysis suggests a split between the items that are
 consumed in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant)
 against those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer
 are more readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education show that the items available
 in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive elasticitie
s for income and education rank whereas the items of agrarian production
 seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations huddled
 in the urban areas.
 Similarly, how consumers respond to changes in kerosene and electricity
 prices indicates the limited availability of industrial items.
 A contrast between the items that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this urban-rural
 split as well (demand for items such as rice, beef is less sensitive to
 electricity than it is to kerosene).
 It isn't simply that the electricity consumers are more likely to consume
 the more expensive items (due to their higher incomes) but that a certain
 items become less relevant in the urban settings or are simply unavailable
 in the rural settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further, the signs of the coefficients suggest that mangoes (less
 consumed) and rice (commonly consumed) to be substitutes while fish appears
 as a complement to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.)
 rice.
 Similarly, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_f
lour]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens - while it is a substitute to bread
 and mangoes respectively.
 However, the observed substitution and complementarity is hardly an indicator
 of the overall quality since the reported cross-price elasticities do not
 consider the functional separation in consumption as well.
 More specifically, one cannot make much out of the cross-elasticities of
 kerosene with respect to buns or cassava unless without imposes strict
 separability assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 or model restrictions (such as more buns would means less cooking in the
 household etc.).
 An aggregated view of the basket is thus preferred given our interest in
 the choice of quality exercised by the consumer when faced with multiple
 varieties of several qualities and price.
