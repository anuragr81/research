\begin_layout Abstract
Nutritional diversity varies significantly across socio-economic status
 (SES) in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The current study explores the demand substitution for food categories
 in Tanzania using a framework for quality with a particular focus on the
 role of intergenerational wealth and permanent income on the quality consumed.
 The findings indicate a higher quality of meats and fruits in particular
 to be aligned with the distribution of wealth and the availability of electrici
ty in Tanzania - suggesting that the access to urban amenities significantly
 increases consumption of higher priced food items across the economy.

 They maintain that while Tanzania has done well to maintain broad self-sufficie
ncy in basic foodstuffs to date, rapid urbanisation will pose a severe future
 challenge as regards food security, particularly for the disadvantaged
 poorer sections of the towns and cities in terms of food affordability,
 accessibility, stability and food safety.
 Tanzanian policy is already shifting from the goal of supplying urban populatio
ns with food at favourable prices to a more rural focus with the aim of
 improving the capacity of rural areas to meet growing urban demand.
 In urban areas, Crush et al.
 (2012) found that food insecurity is mainly due to households poverty status,
 along with high unemployment rates and limited income-generating opportunities,
 rather than any absolute food shortages.
 Urban agriculture is common in the country.
  About 70 % of the mainland population of Tanzania is still rural, with
 the majority engaged in subsistence farming for their own or very local
 consumption (we've ignored local consumption).
 It's worth checking how much of self-consumption is there in the data.

An improvement in the diversity of food items is often recommended for nutrition

 A more diverse diet - particularly during the early stages of life - indicates

 An issue with nutritional inadequacies often encountered by policy is the
 strong association of dietary diversity with a household's socioeconomic

 In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa (SAA) - where food insecurity is
 more often due to poverty status of the households rather than absolute
 food shortages (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "CrushFoodCrisisAfricanCities2012"

\end_inset

) - the dietary diversity (DD) is reported to vary significantly across
 SES  levels as well.
 The current chapter examines the variation in demand for food from a DD
 perspective while using a robust framework for quality in demand.
 The quality framework is used to explain role of SES, the basic amenities
 as well as urbanisation levels on DD in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a robust measure for quality across commodities (such as fruits, fat,
 meats-proteins etc.), the empirical method used in the chapter upholds the
 theoretical restrictions imposed by aggregation of demand across various
 goods (such as coconut, mango etc.
 that may be classified within a commodity - fruits) that are part of a
 commodity group (such as fruits).
 More specifically, the method follows the restrictions implied due to the
 Hick's commodity theorem (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hicksvaluecapital1946,DeatonEconConsumer,NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) which requires the physical quantities of goods consumed to be weighted
 by unchanging (relative) prices of the constituent goods before the quantities
 can be aggregated into the demand for group whose quality is measured.
 For example, the quality of fruits as commodity is evaluated only as long
 as the goods - coconut, mango etc.
 that may constitute the fruits commodity - exhibit a stable relative price-stru
cture.
 To avoid confusion in the terminology associated goods and quality, we
 use the nomenclature provided by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, the primary criterion of grouping the demand from goods consumed
 into a commodity group using the method is a stable relative price-structure
 of market prices which are available in the consumption survey
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The prices observed in local markets are those in the district where the
 household - whose consumption is recorded for budget shares and quality
 measures - is located.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 With the direct use of market-observed prices, the quality measure used
 in the study also avoids using unit-values (price-deflator) as price controls
 in our analysis.
 More particularly, the market-prices used as controls in the econometric
 analyses avoid measurement errors arising with the use of unit-values -
 which approximate the price of an item with the average of item expenditure
 divided by its quantity consumed.
 Once the constituents of a commodity group are selected using the criterion
 of a stable relative price structure (such as goods constituted within
 commodities fruits, meatsproteins etc.
 each), they are subdivided further into final sub-groups based on the categorie
s suggested by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
 (FAO) so as to allow inferences from a DD perspective (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KennedyBallardFantaFAO2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The commodity groups - which we calculate the quality consumed corresponding
 to each household for - are fat, meats-proteins, cereals, vegetables, milk,
 starches, complements, tubers, fruits, fish and chicken (see Section

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between food diversity and household socioeconomic status
 that we intend to explore with the quality framework is of a particular
 relevance for countries in SSA - given the recent changes in dietary patterns
 and food prices that have followed the trends of urbanisation and the movement
 away from subsistence farming in the region (

 The nutritional concerns - such as consumption of higher quantities (and
 thus lower price-based quality) of starch or fatty foods in some SSA regions
 (

, Tanzania serves as an appropriate case-study for the discussion of SES
 effects on quality substitution and diversity across food commodities in

 provide us an opportunity to investigate the differences in consumer diets

 quantities as measures of demand for commodities (

 The diversity score approaches based on FAO categories (

key "OgechiChilezieDDNigeria2017,ModjadjiDDSA2020,OBAYELUNigeriaDDLowIncome"

\end_inset

) are essentially aggregate measures that do not factor in the quantities
 consumed by a household.
 On the other hand, an approach to combine quantities of goods consumed
 into the demand for a commodity - based on an arbitrary or intuitive grouping
 of goods - may not follow separability in demand or other restrictions
 of demand analysis (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 points out, an approach to consider a simple sum of quantities consumed
 from across items (or goods) within a commodity group (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) may only make sense if one imposes severe restrictions on consumer preferences.
 The quality measure based on Hick's commodity theorem that relies on market-obs
erved prices remedies such issues without imposing restricting assumptions
 on consumer demand (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hicksvaluecapital1946,NelsonQualityQuantity"

 It also avoids the use of intuitive grouping of goods into commodities
 - a step that necessitates using the researcher's own judgment of substitution
 within commodity-groups.

 The condition of a stable relative prices structure (due to Hicks Commodity
 Theorem) is what drives a clustering of relative price changes across all
 goods for food in the survey.
 To provide a DD perspective, the commodity groups thus obtained from the
 clustering are further divided based on the twelve FAO categories - (i)
 cereals, (ii) vegetables, (iii) fruits, (iv) meat, (v) eggs (vi) fish and
 other sea foods (vii) legumes, nuts and seeds, (viii) milk and milk products

 The resultant commodities for which quality is evaluated are fat, meats-protein

 and chicken.

Other that the stable relative price-structure associated with a commodity
 (fat, cereals etc.), the quality metric for every household depends on the
 quantities of high vs low-price variants (goods) consumed within a food
 commodity (e.g.
 the quantities consumed of wheat, rice, maize for quality in cereals commodity).
 Considering a commodity-group of cereals comprising of rice, maize and
 wheat, for example, maize would contribute to lower quality of cereals-commodit
y than wheat and rice if the prices of wheat and rice are higher than that
 of maize.
 Other than the quality metric thus calculated for every food commodity
 (such as cereals), the budget shares for each of these commodities are
 used as dependent variables in the system of equations used for an AIDS
 estimation.

 With electricity available is sparsely available in the urban areas of

The presented chapter contributes to the literature in three ways.
 First, it explains the role of SES on food demand from a DD perspective
 by using a framework more thorough and robust than the overall measures
 for diversity that are more commonly used in the literature.
 Second, it provides a feasible way to include food prices as controls to
 detail the effect of urbanisation effects and amenities.
 Lastly, it establishes a sound methodology relying on the Hick's commodity
 theorem by both sticking to theoretical constraints and avoiding use of
 unit-prices that often lead to severe measurement errors.

In one of the earliest approaches for measurement of demand for quality,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerQuality1952"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 treats quality as a separate good - decomposing the quality price elasticity
 of demand (quantity purchased) into a quantity price elasticity of expenditure
 on quality and an income elasticity of quality measure.
 The treatment of quality as a separate good has since been widely in use
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 A common example of the approach is a simple repackaging method (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) - which interprets demand for a high-quality good as multiples of lower
 quality goods.
 More specifically, the demand for goods with a certain price using the
 repackaging approach is viewed in terms of a base-price and a quality parameter
 - the implicit assumption being that the variants in every category are
 perfect substitutes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most empirical studies, however, the perfect substitution turns out
 to be a stringent requirement since the variation in quality among goods
 within a commodity may be often extreme.
 As an example, even though quality consumed of electricity under energy
 commodity may be higher than that of kerosene, the substitution between
 electricity and kerosene may in fact be little - thus making it difficult
 to justify a view of a demand for electricity in terms of the units of
 kerosene consumed
\begin_inset Foot

While one may address this issue with use of an energy-budget (calories),
 the unavailability of quantities consumed or prices in the consumption
 data limit wider applications of such an approach.

Some constraints on either consumer preferences or prices are needed - when
 perfect substitution isn't possible - for us to measure quality using the
 quantities consumed and prices of goods within a commodity.
 As such, the problem of measuring quality of a commodity comprising of
 multiple goods is that of assigning a quality metric to the entire commodity
 group using the a combination of quantities consumed of the goods within
 the commodity group at prices known for every good.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 explains, the approach to measurement of food quality in such a manner
 must either assume weakly separable preferences with homothetic within-group
 preferences (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CoxWohlgenant1986,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) or a stable price-structure in a commodity group with a base-price associated
 with the commodity.
 The current chapter opts for the latter approach since it not only imposes
 fewer restrictions on the consumer preferences but also makes use of the
 market prices rather than the unit-prices
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The unit-prices are the total expenditure divided by quantities consumed
 that are used prices as controls in a regression with budget, quantity

 It is worth emphasising that the homotheticity of within-group preferences
 presents
\series bold
 
\series default
an implausible constraint on the demand - since it implies either that the
 within-group income expansion path would be a straight line through the
 origin or that the group composition would remain independent of income
 - conditions.
 Such a restriction on preferences would mean - for example - that the ratio
 of electricity consumed to the kerosene consumed must be the same for both
 rich and poor consumers - a constraint that is unlikely to hold empirically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More formally, consider that in a generic sense, a quality-metric associated
 with a certain commodity (e.g.
 cereals, fat etc.) depends on a grouping of items - which the commodity
 comprises of - subject to certain homegeneity restrictions.
 Given the quantity consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $\{q_{i}\}_{i\in[1,n]}=\{q_{1},q_{2},...,q_{n}\}$

Such an aggregation requires that the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 groups (commodities) are separable and that the demand for items within
 each group is a homogenous function of the goods it contains (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

).
 The approach followed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - using the sum of physical quantities as measure of demand - requires
 that the homogeneity restriction is put on the household preferences while
 assuming that the within-group preferences are homothetic.
 However, the approach from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 (as well as that from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 heterogeneity in its use of sums of physical quantities as the measure
 of demand (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 The Hick's commodity theorem-based approach - which imposes a restriction
 only on prices of goods - does not suffer with the issue as it does not
 impose the stringent homotheticity assumption on preferences.

Simply put, the approach we adopt in the current chapter prevents considering
 chicken and eggs into one commodity unless the relative price structure
 for the two items (chicken and eggs) does not change.
 No other criteria - arbitrary or otherwise - is followed to group the goods
 into commodities.
 Subject to the restriction, the notion of quality is set to a price-weighted
 quantity (made possible due the availability of market prices) so that
 given the same expenditure, a lower quantity of the composite good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the composite good 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 The commodity groups thus selected are obtained by clustering goods into
 commodity groups based on similar price-changes over the years 2008, 2010,

The issue of unavailability of market prices - often sidelined in many empirical
 studies - has recently gathered some attention (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 As such the measurement of quality is often performed without available
 market prices - by simply averaging over the expenditures (recorded costs)
 of a particular item in a given region (or over the entire population of
 households).
 This so-called unit-value (or price-deflator) method uses the average expenditu
re divided by quantity consumer for all the consumers as prices in the empirical
 analyses (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for a recent implementation).
 While using unit-values as prices may be appropriate for certain empirical
 concerns, the measurement errors introduced by their can be severe and
 difficult to ignore for finer conclusions relating to price and income
 elasticities.
 More specifically, the quantity consumed appearing both in the dependent
 variable (as budget share's numerator) and in the control variable (as
 the denominator for unit-value used as price) cannot be always mitigated

Compared with the measurement of elasticities for every individual good,
 the advantage with the aggregation over commodity groups is that the latter
 does not present the issue of non-consumption of high-quality goods.
 More specifically, if one were to calculate the price elasticities for
 individual goods, an obvious issue that arises is that certain items (particula
rly those with high-quality) might not be consumed at all for a significant
 part of the population.

 also use the unit-values instead of (unavailable) market prices.
 Further, the unit-values obtained from the households using a good are
 used as prices for those who don't consume the good.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While HW approach may be well-suited for comparison of elasticities for
 specific goods (see Appendix II for empirical results using the approach),
 the comparison of quality across multiple commodities is a more appropriate
 interpretation for the overview of quality we seek in the current chapter.
 Since it is much less likely for no goods to be consumed within a broader
 commodity group (fruits-veg, protein etc.) over which the quality measure
 is calculated, the approach with quality aggregated over broader commodity
 groups also circumvents the issue of non-consumption.
 No correction related to non-consumption - as used in HW method - is therefore
 used with our approach that aggregates quality over groups classified with
 homogeneity restrictions (see Section

 A control for amenities such as electricity are also used - other than
 permanent income as our main explanatory variable - in the current chapter
 to examine the variation in food quality across Tanzania.
 In its particular context, rapid urbanisation seems to have brought challenges
 to food security for the lower-income households in the towns and cities
 within Tanzania - even though the country has managed to maintain a broad
 self-sufficiency in basic food items (

 The agricultural policy has also focused on a transition from subsistence

 seems common in the country (

 As such, a significant number of households dependent on self-farming in

 and rural food demand that may be apparent from the conventional models

 A further sub-classification - which does not disrupt the commodities identifie
d based on similarity of price structure - is used to assist interpretation
 from a DD perspective and is guided by FAO categories recommended for food
 diversity.
 It is worth highlighting that instead of measuring an overall food quality
 across all of the food items consumed, we inspect quality only for different
 commodity groups whose constituents satisfy the Hick's commodity theorem.
 The quality across food can thus be seen as a vector associated with the
 set of food commodities.
 As we detail in the Section

The main criterion of grouping of food items into commodity groups the co-moveme
nt of prices.
 The prices - shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 - are taken from the wave corresponding to years 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014
 in the survey.
 An unsupervised k-means clustering is then used to group the items into
 commodities based on price changes - so that the items within every commodity
 group identified have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

similar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 relative price-changes.
 The groups based strictly on price-movements thus obtained are then split
 into further categories aligned with the FAO recommended categories i.e.
 (i) cereals, (ii) vegetables, (iii) fruits, (iv) meat, (v) eggs (vi) fish
 and other sea foods (vii) legumes, nuts and seeds, (viii) milk and milk
 products (ix) oil and fats, (x) sweets (xi) spices, condiments and beverages
 and (xii) tubers and roots.
 More specifically, the k-means clustering is performed on the relative
 price-changes from available prices.
 Considering beef as an example good, the prices for beef in the years 2008,
 2010, 2012, 2014 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LSMSMarketPrices"
plural "false"

\end_inset

) are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{beef}=\{3500.0,4000.0,5000.0,6000.0\}$
\end_inset

 - which correspond to a relative price-change vector 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{beef}=\{\frac{4000}{3500},\frac{5000}{4000},\frac{6000}{5000}\}=\{1.14,1.25,1.2\}$
\end_inset

.
 The relative price-change vectors for all the items (beef, goat, fresh_milk
 etc.) thus obtained are clustered using the k-means method - where the number
 of selected clusters is guided by the within-cluster sum of squared errors
 - an approach commonly used in k-means applications (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pollard1982CLTKmeans"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The classification we use as the basis for commodity groups are arrived
 at by setting the number of clusters to 5 which is when the within-cluster
 sum of squared errors drops to less than unity

It is worth emphasising that the partition of commodity groups identified
 from the unsupervised k-means clustering into further sub-groups based
 on FAO categories does not pick goods from disparate clusters into a new
 sub-group.
 Instead, the further partition into sub-groups based on FAO categories
 is based on the observation that that the price-changes of goods within
 sub-groups formed by splitting a particular group identified by clustering
 would also be correlated with each other.
 The groups obtained by the classification based on correlation prices (shown
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PriceBasedGroups"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 Table

 More specifically, the commodity cereals-milk-greens is split into milk,
 veg and cereals, fruits-fish is split into fruits and fish, startches-fats-comp
lements is split into startches, fats and complements while the categories
 tubers and meatsproteins are retained.
 The resulting categories are therefore i) cereals ii) veg iii) fruits iv)
 meats-proteins v) fish vi) milk vii)fat viii) complements ix) tubers x)
 chicken and xi) starches whose constituents are shown in Table

As explained before, the basis for the quality metric associated for every

\begin_inset Formula $G$

 (corresponding to the left side of the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Hicksvaluecapital1946"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) which states that a group of goods behave as if they were a single commodity
 so long as the the prices of the group of goods changes in the same proportion.
 Simply put, a constant relative price structure allows us to factor out
 the quantity of the composite commodity consumed from the demand function
 for the variants (goods) within the commodity - allowing the price of quality
 to be interpreted in terms of a composite price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the commodity aggregate 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the price-structure

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 goods with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}=\{p_{i,G}\}_{i\in[1,n]}$

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$

 as the total expenditure on group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 This is further explained in Section

 The essential appeal of aggregation is the simplified view of demand across
 all items.
 Consider for example, if we were to represent demands for items {wheat,
 rice, yam,coconut, eggs, beef, chicken, fish, goat, honey}.
 As such these items would each correspond to a demand function so that
 10 functions describe the demand for all the 10 items.
 The aggregated view allows us to view demands for commodities {carb, protein
 and complements} - where the 10 goods are encompassed in just 3 respective
 functions for the 3 commodity groups.
 A key requirement for the validity of such a quality metric - however -
 is that the prices of goods within the commodity group have a constant
 relative price-structure i.e.
 a relative prices ratio that can be factored out of the observed prices
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity,GibsonKimQualityBog2019"

 This condition - due to the Hicks commodity theorem - drives the k-means
 grouping of items described above.

 To explain with particular example goods, consider two pairs of items with
 similar price-movements - with sugar and tea being the first pair that
 has its constituents tea and sugar - with similar price changes (see Table

 similar to each other (see Table

 Notice however that not only do sugar and tea have similar price changes,
 they also have a similar functional sense implied by FAO categories.
 Therefore, they are classified in a group complements in the Table

 Other categories such as meatsproteins, fruits etc.
 are similarly based foremost on price-movement correlations before considering
 the functional sense implied by FAO categories for interpretation from
 a DD perspective.

 Based on the local market-observed prices of the goods within the commodity
 group 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 (such as cereals, fat etc.), the quality metric for the household ensures
 that a household who buys more of the high-priced good within a commodity
 group is viewed as one consuming higher quality of the commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 This is why no quality is considered for chicken, the only good within
 its own commodity group.
 As we've explained in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ClassificationGoods"
plural "false"

, the k-means clustering interprets the restriction that there is a constant
 relative price structure on the constituent items of commodity group (the
 Hicks aggregation condition).

\begin_layout Standard
To calculate the quality associated with a group 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 (such as the items : eggs and cooking oil in the commodity: fat) that have
 a constant within-group relative price-structure, a base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 for the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (fat) is selected as the minimum price of the items among the commodity
 aggregate constituents (e.g.
 among cooking-oil and eggs).
 This is based on the approach suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The base-price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 is then used to assign i) an aggregate-quantity of a composite good (for
 fat) comprising of quantities consumed of the items constituted in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (cooking-oil eggs) and ii) a quality metric corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 ( based on the proportion of cooking-oil and eggs consumed).
 In other words, with the quantities consumed for cooking-oil and eggs under
 fat commodity available to us, a quantity of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is associated with the particular set of quantities consumed for eggs and
 cooking-oil consumed.
 The aggregate-quantity of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is then calculated by relative-prices-weighed averages of cooking-oil and
 eggs consumed (see details below).
 If cooking-oil per unit-weight is cheaper than eggs-per-unit-weight, then
 this quality metric would evidently be lower when more cooking-oil is consumed
 for the same expenditure.
 This notion of higher-quality is thus based solely on price alone so that
 a more expensive item within the commodity group is contribute to higher
 quality of the commodity.

In more formal terms, quantity-price tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1},p_{1}),(q_{2},p_{2}),(q_{3},p_{3})...$

\begin_inset Formula $(Q_{G},P_{G})$
\end_inset

 as well as a quality metric 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}$
\end_inset

 We define the total physical sum of quantities consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{G}$

 as follows

Let's consider an example to illustrate how the measure of quality would
 relate with the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 in the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the group aggregate price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a more detailed theoretical discussion).
 Let's say we observe the consumption on cooking-oil and eggs within a fat
 commodity with prices observed as 20£, 10£ (resp.) and the quantities consumed
 by the household are 1.5 kg and 2 kg (resp.).
 One approach is to the treat the physical sum of quantities i.e.
 3.5 kg as the quantity of the composite good 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, it is more difficult to argue that the households optimise the
 weight of the composite good - rather than comparing the disparate quantities
 of goods (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for details of this argument).
 Since quality is to be priced in the market, a quality-adjusted quantity
 is the more appropriate formulation where we consider a price-structured
 weighted quantity as the quality-adjusted quantity and express the pair
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(p_{cooking\_oil},q_{cooking\_oil}),(p_{eggs},q_{eggs})\}=\{(20,1.5),(10,2)\}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,5(=2\times1.5+1\times2))$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.43=\frac{5}{1.5+2})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(P_{fat},Q_{fat}),(0,V_{fat})\}=\{(10,5),(0,1.43)\}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{fat}$
\end_inset

) is simply the minimum of 
\begin_inset Formula $20,10$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the prices of cooking-oil and eggs respective - corresponding to the price-stru
cture 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{G}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is (2,1) for {cooking-oil,eggs}.

 Further, since the price for quality is not required, the price-coefficients

 for all

The homogeneity and adding-up restrictions mean that the sum of all expenditure
 shares in the AIDS model is unity - thus leading to the residuals variance-cova
riance matrix becoming singular (

\end_inset

).
 As a solution to this well-known estimation problem, it is common to delete
 one of the equations to estimate and recover its coefficients through the
 adding-up restrictions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ParisCaraccioloTestingAIDSAddingUp2014,LiGangTourismdemand2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the adding-up restrictions require that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{G}^{n}\rho_{1,G}=1$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{G}^{n}\beta_{G,1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{G}^{n}\gamma_{1,Gj}=1$

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j}^{n}\gamma_{1,Gj}=0$
\end_inset

 (for all 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

).
 Thus one of the commodity group (chicken) - which does not correspond to
 a quality is ignored from the estimation.
 The coefficients in the budget-share equation for chicken can be recovered
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{chicken}=1-\sum_{G\ne chicken}^{n}\rho_{1,G}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1,chicken,j}=-\sum_{G\ne chicken}^{n}\gamma_{1,Gj}$

These conditions are repeated in the estimation for every other 
\begin_inset Formula $G\in\{fat,cereals,veg,milk,meatsproteins,starches,complements,tubers,fruits,fish\}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 10 commodities in total.
 The system of equation is thus used to observe the variation of measures
 of quality across the permanent income and household characteristics in
 Tanzania.
 The entire set of equations consists of two equations for each commodity
 (10) - where one equation (per commodity) has budget-share as the dependent
 variable and another equation has quality-metric as the dependent variable.
 These 
\begin_inset Formula $10\times2=20$
\end_inset

 equations with respective constraints are listed in Appendix IV.
 The AIDS estimation for the system of equations that accommodates the constrain
ts uses a 3SLS method (instead of SUR - which requires at least one regressor
 not used in other equations).

The data used for our analysis has been obtained from the Living Standard
 Measurement Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World Bank - for the year 2014
 - which is the last wave in the survey.
 The survey has been designed to assist in the understanding of links between
 asset ownership, community access (to market, schools), food prices and
 agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys from multiple countries is largely uniform in its
 data-model (fields) and is often georeferenced with a sufficiently wide-coverag
e in the country to allow a study of spatial variation in the observed variables.
 The years used for the analyses are the most recent years in the survey
 for Tanzania (2014) i.e.
 the last wave available in the survey at the time of writing this chapter.
 The price-data which we used in the classification described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

The LSMS survey records past expenditure with diary and recall methods.
 The diary method is used for food items while other purchases are recorded
 as weekly, monthly and yearly recalls.
 The expenditures on food are recorded with a greater level of detail than
 other expenditures.
 The demographic variables from survey that we use in our a cross-sectional
 analysis are based on the current locality and the number of members in
 the family.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption microdata for the year (2014) - used for budget shares and
 quality measures - is combined from across the recall and weekly diaries
 - merging the weekly data with yearly data by multiplying the past week's
 consumption into the number of weeks in the year.
 The details of this process are described in Appendix I.
 Once combined, the market prices for the goods consumed by a household
 are matched with the reported consumed quantities of the food items

The absence of a good in the recall record for a household as the good is
 not to be interpreted as evidence of non-usage of the good.
 With the case of electricity, for example, the field for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is more reliable for the test of electricity usage than the last expenditure
 on electricity.

The prices relevant for a household are marked as those that are available
 as market prices in the district where the household is located.
 Since the market-observed prices in the survey are recorded at every district
 level or at finer levels, we match these prices with every household in
 the survey based on the district the household is located in.
 This is necessitated also because not all wards and enumerated-areas(EAs)
 within every district in the survey have prices recorded for all relevant
 food items.
 Further, as price observations at the district level are recorded in different
 quantities (grams, kilograms for weight and liters, mls for fluids etc.),
 we infer the price at the district level using a regression over price
 records for the good in the district.
 This is only a means to standardise the prices in a standard unit such
 as a kilogram or a litre from the prices that are recorded in several units.
 The price per unit of any item declines with the increase in quantity purchase.
 Therefore, the price data from across different recorded quantities are
 assimilated using a regression to obtain the price corresponding to a standard
 unit-quantity of an good (kg,litres etc.).
 A simple quadratic expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{m}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 to used to approximate the inverse proportionality of price-per-unit with
 the quantity purchase.
 Thus, observed marked-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 are regressed against the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 they're recorded in where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a constant .
 The price of any arbitrary quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}$
\end_inset

 of a good is thus simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{\underline{q}^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 and for the price of unit-quantity that we use for base-prices and relative
 price structures, the price is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{q}=1$
\end_inset

 ).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values of assets owned by the household that we use as a measure for
 wealth are obtained from the record of durable goods in the survey.
 The durable goods in the LSMS data range from short-term durable items
 such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such as land
 or housing.
 Of these, we are interested only in the transferable long-term owned assets
 (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Long-term-assets"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The exclusion of short-term assets or the items that are not transferred
 over a generation is based on consideration of intergenerational wealth
 whose relevance is sought as an SES measure.
 The empirical studies often prefer the data on ownership of assets (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) for SES effects since the inter-generational transfers of wealth are what
 make a break in the inequality gap (i.e.
 mobility through reduction of wealth differences) difficult (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ObasuyiEducationInequality2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Another reason why the income data has not been used directly in the current
 study is that it is available only for around 30% of the households that
 we have the diary data for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assets transferred over a generation that we use for SES measures can
 be readily verified by inspecting households in the data that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household - treating
 the assets except land and house that are more expensive than the bed (furnitur
e) as those that contribute to the long-term asset-values.
 The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include
 the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods - rather than reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 - to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding the household for two
 reasons.
 First, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to the errors associated with the recall of the purchase
 value which varies over years in the panel data for the household and item.
 Second, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 also encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time
 - making it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable consumption
 at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the household and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{t}$
\end_inset

 It is worth highlighting that FAO standards do not prescribe what's considered
 a low dietary diversity status.
 It is common for studies to consider empirically validated thresholds for
 the analysis of diversity.

It is worthwhile comparing the variation in food diversity with that of
 food security in Tanzania.
 To gauge the food security, we use the directly observed food deprivation
 in the survey and perform a comparison of the fraction of households having
 run out of food (either due to lack of agricultural inputs or high prices)
 in the past year across urban and rural areas in Tanzania (see Figures
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionAgInp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionHiCost"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 While this does suggest a significant proportion of households running
 out of food in urban areas (due to high costs), the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons- see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FractionHiCost"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The food security is thus likely higher in the urban areas.
 The extremity of urban-rural and regional differences is also evident from
 the non-parametric plot of occupations

 - the asset-ownership and permanent income measures in particular - significant
ly influence the degree to which the household may spend on quality in diverse
 food-categories in Tanzania or not.
 The disaggregated view of quality into commodities based on FAO categories
 allows us to relate the choice for quality in high-level commodity groups
 with the wealth effects controlled with local prices in a robust framework.
 The effect of SES measures - both total assets or total expenditure - is
 significant on food quality - particularly for meats-proteins commodity.
 We also find that access to higher food quality is higher in localities
 with access to electricity.

 the income-elasticities are positive for quality within food categories

 This may not be surprising 
\shape italic

\shape default
 since the income-elasticities for quality are expected to be positive so
 long as a higher total expenditure

 is spent on the more expensive variants (goods) within a food category
 (commodity).
 What's less expected are the negative elasticities for budget-share consumed

\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{results_has_electric_2014}

, we see a higher quality across food categories - an effect similar to
 that of total expenditure logarithm 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp 
\family default
(except for fats where quality is not significantly higher for consumers
 with access to electricity).
 It could be argued that having access to electricity is endogenous with
 higher prosperity.
 Thus it may simply be that those with higher income are the one with access
 to electricity and have a better access to quality through ownership of
 electric appliances.
 However, the correlation of having access to electricity with prosperity
 is more likely through being in the urban area rather through income.
 This is because the indicator variable 
\family typewriter
has_electric 
\family default
used for access to electricity is based only on the usage of electricity
 as the primary source of lighting at home.
 The basic usage of electricity hardly reflects the income of the household
 - and is more strongly correlated with being in an area (more often urban)
 where electricity is available (particularly given the sparse distribution
 of electricity in Tanzania).
 Since availability of refrigeration facilities in a market may improve
 the availability of fruits and meats in a wider area, the positive externality
 through being in richer areas - one that includes access to electricity
 - is more likely to be the cause for higher quality in food categories.

 Estimating the effective quantity of

 about 1.61 times more

 With effective quantity of

 In other words, those with no access to electricity in the urban areas
 are less likely to spend higher on quality of meats-proteins compared to
 the consumers in rural areas.
 The effects of both total expenditure and assets-ownership are significant
 in the quality of consumption for food.
 The access to electricity creates clear differences in lifestyle choices
 and the effect remains significant for access to quality in nutrition.
 In summary, even though there may be some positive externality with being

, we have used diary-costs on goods as reported by the household - costs
 that are recorded by the LSMS for the goods that were consumed from purchases
 in the last week.
 If a household didn't purchase anything in the past week, there would only
 be quantities consumed (not costs) that would be reported for the household
 in the diary.
 Since we have the market-prices available, another way to calculate costs,
 budget-shares and quality would be to infer costs as the multiple of market-pri
ces from the quantities consumed in the past week (which is reported for
 all households regardless of whether they had purchased something in the
 last week or not).
 Recalculating quality and budget shares still shows us the same economic
 and statistical significance (results available on request) of electricity
 and household assets in quality of food categories (commodities).

 The argument for using the education-ranks as instruments is simply that

The availability of market-prices and the details on household characteristics
 as well as owned assets allow us to understand the factors that may cause
 the differences in the consumer baskets and influence consumption of quality.
 Given the disparate consumer baskets for the urban and rural households
 as well as the disparity in household incomes, the differences in expenditure
 on quality is hardly surprising - but differences in quality for meat and
 fresh goods esp for urban households with access to electricity indicates
 a peculiar environmental difference in areas where urban amenities are
 available.
 Whether we use the permanent income measure based on the total expenditure
 or the measure of intergenerational wealth, the relatively affluent households
 appear to avail significantly higher quality and diversity in food.

These results seem to fit in with the observation on the role of positive
 externality made by the studies on subjective welfare in Tanzania.
 More specifically, while poor relative incomes are meant to be strongly
 related with the general happiness and future outlook of a consumer, the
 evidence from the LSMS data suggests that the positive externalities from
 being in a richer area significantly influence the consumer's happiness
 levels recorded in the survey (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "AstebiCarbonell2019"

\end_inset

 ).
 The improvements in food quality may provide one possible channel of how
 positive externalities from being in richer areas might influence the quality
 of life and the subjective welfare of the resident consumers.

While we extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we must also consider that with a large size of families (40% of households
 have size 5 or higher), it may be common to stock goods for consumption.
 The LSMS survey records the quantities for food goods - even if they were
 not purchased in the past week.
 But for other non-food goods (such as soap, skin creams whose quantities
 are not recorded in the survey) are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families as well.
 Since the frequency of purchases would be lower when the quantity of bulk
 purchases increases- this may cause us to overestimate consumption.
 To verify that this not a significant issue, we first test if such stocking
 (quantities purchased) may be uniform in all region in the country.
 We then test the significance of household factors that may affect long-term
 storage (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) of the purchased item.
 Observing the quantity purchased on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure on all goods 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we use a difference-in-means analysis to confirm the low effect of travel-cost
s on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{e}{x})$
\end_inset

 and conclude that stockpiling is not significant.
 It turns out that the number of family members is a far more significant
 factor for large purchases.

For non-food categories, where the data is less detailed, some further adjustmen
ts were made for the classification of non-durable consumption into the
 wide categories of energy and household consumption.
 For example, repairs and maintenance costs - which are provided in the
 weekly diary - were not simply extrapolated to annual consumption (multiplicati
on of a factor of 12) - but instead an assumption on the average life of
 the item being repaired or maintained was considered to perform the extrapolati
on to the annual expenditure.

% A lot of goods in the year 2008 were recorded with the unit as pieces/"idadi"
 (e.g.
 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis.
 These goods were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,
 pulses, peanuts, coconut, onion, greens, dried_canned_veg, banana_ripe,
 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk goods where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the goods where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not

 that a substitution between two goods is possible only if they belong to

 than a claim on household's behaviour (see

The first step with the selection approach is a probit where the dependent
 variable is an indicator variable that is unity when the item is consumed
 and zero otherwise.

 the item and market-characteristics (region etc.

The above item-wise analysis suggests a split between the goods that are
 consumed in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant)
 against those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer
 are more readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education show that the goods available
 in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive elasticitie
s for income and education rank whereas the goods of agrarian production
 seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations huddled
 in the urban areas.
 Similarly, how households respond to changes in kerosene and electricity
 prices indicates the limited availability of industrial goods.
 A contrast between the goods that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this urban-rural
 split as well (demand for goods such as rice, beef is less sensitive to
 electricity than it is to kerosene).
 It isn't simply that the households with electricity are more likely to
 consume the more expensive goods (due to their higher incomes) but that
 a certain goods become less relevant in the urban settings or are simply
 unavailable in the rural settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further, the signs of the coefficients suggest that mangoes (less
 consumed) and rice (commonly consumed) to be substitutes while fish appears
 as a complement to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.)
 rice.
 Similarly, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_f
lour]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens - while it is a substitute to bread
 and mangoes respectively.
 The substitution and complementarity thus observed are hardly an indicator
 of the overall quality since the reported cross-price elasticities do not
 consider the functional separation.
 More specifically, one cannot make much out of the cross-elasticities of
 kerosene with respect to buns or cassava unless without imposing strict
 separability assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 or model restrictions (such as more buns would means less cooking in the
 household etc.).
 An aggregated view of the basket is thus preferred given our interest in
 the choice of quality exercised by the household when faced with multiple
 varieties of several qualities and price.

It is common for the empirical studies in sub-Saharan Africa to use the
 income data only indirectly.
 There are two mains reasons for this.
 First, the income-data is much more sparse than for occupation or education
 (only about a quarter of households, for example, have income data available
 in the LSMS survey for Tanzania).
 Second, the predominance of informal sectors further subjects the income
 data to significant measurement errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the income data may not be of direct utility to its sparsity, it is
 useful in providing an overview of occupational differences in Tanzania.
 As the household occupation-data is more widely available than the income
 data, we use a mapping of incomes on to the list of occupational (ordered)
 ranks by sorting the occupations based on income.
 More specifically, the occupations are sorted based on the average income
 received and categorised in broad ranks ranging form 0 to 3 (non-paying
 occupations are unemployed status is set to 0 and a higher-rank corresponds
 to a higher-income occupation).
 The occupation ranks thus assigned are shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{occupation_rank_tn}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The variation in education levels is also given a similar treatment and
 used as education ranks for comparison.
 In other words, an ordered variable corresponding to the varied education
 levels is inferred as occupation-rank based on income received by the highest-e
ducation level recorded for individuals in the data.
 The mappings from education-levels to education ranks are listed in Table
