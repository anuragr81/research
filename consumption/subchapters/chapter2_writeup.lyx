\begin_layout Title
Status consumption under wealth inequalities 
\begin_inset Newline newline

- a case study in Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role played by wealth
 inequalities in the varied contexts of developing economies has been explored
 less often.
 We use a model for status consumption that view the expenditure in excess
 of needs relative the permanent ownership as non-durable status consumption
 and comment on the opposing effects of peer influences and extreme wealth
 differences in the developing countries.
 Using the consumption data from the Tanzanian LSMS survey we discuss how
 a segregation of status competition based on extreme wealth differences
 and price heterogeneity could characterise status consumption in a developing
 economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical studies in both developed and developing economies have associated
 social segmentation in an economy with disproportionate spending on conspicuous
 items

.
 While such disparities are often explained with social-reference groups,
 the ways in which status consumption differ under the environment of extreme
 poverty in developing countries has been explored less often.
 Noting prevalent wealth inequalities in the developing economies, we reexamine
 the notion of status with a particular focus on the opposing direction
 of peer effects and the effects of wealth differences on status consumption.
 Status consumption - which is undoubtedly enhanced with peer effects -
 should be discouraged under extreme wealth differences when the latter
 cannot be overcome by the consumer.
 Contrary to the idea of pecuniary emulation

 i.e.
 the notion that the habits of the rich are emulated by the poorer consumers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 , extreme wealth differences thus have the effect of making status consumption
 appear futile to the poor consumers.
 Seeking conditions under which the demand for status goods is reduced in
 spatially or economically separated reference groups

\end_layout

\end_inset

 we use a model for status consumption that interprets status in a context
 of socio-economic differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status competition among the consumers that are strictly segregated across
 spatial or socio-economic boundaries (e.g.
 class, region, race etc.) are evidently segmented across the groups.
 But while the poor may not emulate the rich separated by huge wealth difference
s, the status competitions are not limited to one's own reference group
 either.
 The consumers infer the status of other reference groups which they don't
 belong to just as well as they compare themselves with the participants
 in their own reference groups.
 The extent to which status consumption is driven by the level of segregation
 in an economy is the quantitative concern our model for status is concerned
 with.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building upon the social-deference view of status that has been embraced
 in many economic studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we use a model where status consumption is used to offset the effect of
 existing wealth hierarchies towards status.
 Any two consumers in the model thus compete with each other for status
 using both the permanent ownership of items and the excess non-durable
 consumption (i.e.
 consumption above the cost of needs) .
 For the empirical measurement of the permanent ownership of items we rely
 on the long term durable goods data available for every household in the
 survey.
 The excess non-durable consumption is measured using the cost of needs
 - which in comprises of the cost of basic needs varying across regions
 and the cost of owning long-term goods (also available in the survey).
 After adjusting for her needs, a consumer optimises the utility she obtains
 from both excess and long-term possessions.
 Social or spatial characteristics matter to the consumer in the model through
 both the durable goods cluster which the consumer belongs to and the price
 of needs that the consumer is exposed to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In popular culture, status consumption often evokes images of wasteful expenditu
re and exclusive possessions that provide no economic value other than an
 attraction to people of equal affluence.
 This rather inadequate view of status consumption is source of an incessant
 debate on whether a consumer's newly acquired wealth - whether it be jewelry
 of acquisition of undervalued land or property - should be considered part
 of her necessities for higher status or wasteful conspicuous consumption.
 Since we have no way of knowing the intentions of consumers by evaluating
 her consumption diaries, we focus only on the measurements of existing
  wealth and an incontrovertible notion of basic necessities instead of
 drawing normative judgments on the appropriate level of needs for the consumer.
 We rely on a notion of basic needs in an economy to infer a notion of excess
 – so that the rich in an economy do not inherently have needs different
 from the poor - instead only different levels of excess over basic needs
 and the disparate long-term possessions.
 The notion of excess also excludes any maintenance costs for the long-term
 possession the role of which towards status is considered explicitly.
 For example, if one has a car, the petrol used up for driving is not an
 excess and contributes only to the cost of bearing assets.
 As consumer are meant to use to both excess and long-term ownership for
 status competitions excess and since excess vary according to a particular
 asset-cluster / band
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 one belongs, the idiosyncratic habits are expected to average out for the
 notion of excess relative to durable goods ownership.
 This is admissible since the empirical claim that we wish to test is whether
 non-durable status consumption - viewed as excess over needs - is dominated
 by status competition in the local wealth hierarchy or those among the
 consumers of similar wealth in a spatial proximity.
 The significance of the metrics related to wealth at local and national
 levels help us comment if local peer effects are more important for the
 consumer than the differences in wealth at observed the higher level in
 the wider economy.
 We believe that this detail of non-durable status consumption is more relevant
 to how status motivations influence urban migration or demand for industrial
 items than the analysis of visible items in the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key appeal of the above approach is that unlike with the studies in
 visible consumption, one needs not rely on the assumption that status goods
 are futile.
 While the futility assumption implicitly ensures the separability of demand
 for visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004,ireland_signals"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in an empirical analysis, it neither encompasses status consumption fully
 nor does it satisfy a desired criterion for visibility in bandwagon items
 such as electronics or cars that have clear utility in the regular sense
 apart from providing relative status advantage.
 In using the permanent ownership and a more general notion of quality which
 includes any high-price non-durable consumption - we circumvent the futility
 assumption - which we feel may be inadequate for the representation of
 status consumption in a developing economy.
 This allows us to move beyond proxies of cultural contexts (e.g.
 using visibility surveys
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 etc.) or a focus on historically restricted goods (e.g.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen has explored the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

 - but Veblen hardly dwells upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

Assisted with the developments in game theory and an improvement in the

 We argue that this recent attention to status consumption need not to be
 viewed asunder from the consumer demand literature on habit-formation (see

 The empirical literature on quality in consumption

could be extended to view status consumption if a suitable relation between

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A robust empirical measure of quality has been subject to much debate in
 the literature - due in part to the lack of sufficiently detailed consumption
 surveys.
 Most consumption surveys hardly record the market-observed prices or the
 quantities of the items consumed - let alone the brand-related details
 of the items.
 The market-prices of items purchases or even quantities consumed - which
 could permit us to view quality as the proportion of expensive items standardis
ed by quantity (see Nelson

) - are seldom recorded in the consumption surveys.
 Since we are concerned only with value of consumption towards status rather
 than the estimation of quality elasticities, we rely on the notion of excess
 which depends only on the market-observed prices of needs and the total
 reported expenditure.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This relationship is allows us to investigate status consumption in the
 context of developing countries where it is less likely to be observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of status most commonly used in literature is one where it is
 seen as a long-term characteristics of the consumer.
 The view of status as a static characteristic in fact poses an obvious
 paradox with respect to consumption - since there cannot be any utility
 from status-consumption if status were only accumulated over a long-term.
 The paradox is trivially resolved if one considers that status is subject
 to change with consumption - just the way it is shaped by income or education
 (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 where status - like in many studies in sociology and health sciences -
 is used as a vector education or income ).
 The dynamic view of status - provided by Coleman

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and having been widely embraced in the economic studies - presents status
 as an wealth-based ranking order that can be altered by the consumer with
 consumption.
 A consumer thus achieves status utility through status consumption by moving
 herself up in a ranking order that is otherwise determined by wealth.
 A model that that views consumption in the context of status as a ranking
 order based on income or wealth could be used to endogenise the role of
 social identity in conspicuous consumption as well.
 This is the view used in our intertemporal formulation of status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the role which social identities play in status consumption
 has been explored in much of the literature (see Chao et al.
 [#Chao1998], Charles et al.
 [#CharlesHurstRace], Omori et al.
 [#OmoriSmithVisRace], Kaus[#KausSA] and Khamis et al.[#ZahraIndia] - also
 see the marketing literature on identity formation and acquired goods [#gierl_s
carcity, #Eastman1999]), the relevance of wealth differences in status consumpti
on has not been discussed in much detail in the literature on conspicuous
 consumption we have surveyed (except for some studies directly exploring
 the effect income inequality on conspicuous consumption with exogenously
 observed poverty/income levels or GINI indices - see Jaikumar

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The inclusion of long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in status-related consumption has been rather arbitrary in much
 of the literature.
 Viewing status consumption in the context of wealth differences could also
 guide the assessment of whether a particular long-term durable good should
 be viewed as part of status consumption or not.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Our approach towards status consumption differs slightly from the recent
 studies on visible consumption in that instead of assuming that the status-indi
cating goods in a developing country must be the same as those that are
 considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed economies , we explicitly consider the role that wealth
 differences could play towards status differences in the developed economies
 .
 We argue that the wealth differences may be far too wide and important
 for a specific range of available visible items to matter outside of one's
 reference group in the status competitions in developing economies (where
 industrial development is concentrated into fewer urban areas).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An obvious issue with viewing social identities in the same ranking order
 as that of wealth is that of scope associated with social identities
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since social identities are themselves often a result of long-term wealth
 differences, the problem that social differences are not wealth differences
 does not arise in most empirical studies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 While some social identities may be perceived to be of higher status than
 others, the individuals that are too poor or too different from other groups
 might not compare themselves with those that are either too rich or too
 different from themselves.
 That the competitions to reach a higher status are segmented by social
 identities has been confirmed in quite a few empirical studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace,KausSA"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The role which social identities play towards consumption is thus complicated
 due to the social identities being i) limited the status consumption within
 themselves and ii) of a status value (higher or lower) also to those who
 are outside the respective social group (see Timothy

 for an empirical perspective on reference groups).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We simplify this view by considering that it is only outside the reference
 group driven by one's identity that a social identity may influence status
 the way wealth differences would.
 Within the scope of the social identity that determines a reference group,
 the social identity doesn't carry much status to those belonging to the
 reference group (since everybody carries the same social identity).
 Thus a consumer must avail utility towards status both by comparing herself
 to the members of her reference group and with the entire reference groups
 that are not her own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status consumption are thus necessarily segmented according to this view
 - and we cannot assume that the lower economic classes unconditionally
 emulate the habits of upper economic classes (pecuniary emulation) or even
 participate in the same status competitions as those who are perceived
 to have higher status - since the social identities limit status competitions
 within themselves (see Ustuner-Holt

 To look at the segmentation in status consumption due to socio-economic
 stratification in more detail, we use the condition that beyond a certain
 limit of differences in wealth hierarchy, a given status item may not be
 of value to the poorer consumer(s).
 Section

 generalises this idea of segmentation of status consumption across the
 levels (bands) of income and wealth in an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An empirical analysis with this model relies on two key measurements - the
 wealth of a consumer (which can be proxied relatively easily if the stock
 of durable goods possessed by consumer - inclusive of housing, land and
 other long-term assets - is available) and the non-durable consumption
 in excess of needs - which we hereforth refer to as excess.
 Here, the fulfillment of basic needs is not meant to offer an advantage
 to the consumer in a status competition.
 A consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) measured as excess - in other words - would have higher status
 than another consumer who consumes less quality (excess) while the needs
 of the two consumers are the same.
 If basic needs of the two consumers being compared are the same and their
 difference in needs arise only out of their long-term possessions, then
 the addressing of needs alone does not provide any status utility than
 what is provided by the long-term possessions or characteristics.
 It follows that if there is any status related utility to be derived from
 non-durable consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from excess
 (which is defined as distance from all needs tied to a particular reference
 group).
 It also follows that any status in a particular reference group that is
 not signaled with excess must come out of the possession of (and thus utility
 from) the long-term durable goods (or the proxy of wealth).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical measurement of excess requires i) the costs associated with
 the durable goods and ii) higher-than-required consumption based on a minimum
 necessary consumption.
 The costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of durable goods are
 easy to obtain as they are often available as part of the consumer diary.
 Similarly, the variation in the cost of a standard basket of basic needs
 across the regions and districts is often available with the market prices
 in a survey.
 Therefore, as long as the basic needs of the consumer and the possession
 of the long-term durable goods can be determined in an economy, the 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
can be readily estimated for every consumer.
 That said, an empirical assessment of what is consider

The idea of basic needs itself hasn't been without controversy - since on
 one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, a commonly-understood set of needs could incontrovertibly
 supersede a consumer's subjective interests (wants).
 To fix a particular definition of needs for own empirical analyses, we
 lean towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy - in addition to health - as a basic need of the
 consumer without shunning the idea that the needs should vary across cultural
 contexts.
 The basic needs of the consumer are thus the standard requirements not
 meeting which would lead to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the
 theory argued for by Doyal and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 These basic needs are easy to separate empirically from the costs (maintenance,
 fees etc.) associated with durable goods which a consumer possesses.
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite.
 A starch diet fulfilling the set of

We interpret the ideas of health and autonomy as the basic (or internal)
 needs of the consumer in a particular cultural setting - driven by the
 biological needs of the household (represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - the number of household-members, number of children, individual age,
 body weight etc.).
 However, our notion of excess is hardly an ontological one - and it encompasses
 what the consumer feels important rather than what she is supposed to feel
 important.
 Consider for example the question of whether lodging/home-ownership or
 the primary education of children in the area where a consumer resides
 should be considered a basic need or not.
 Evidently, such needs are determined by a social reference rather than
 biology.
 Using the biological needs alone as the reference level consumption amounts
 to ignoring the the peer effects that have a role in choice for status
 goods.
 The utility that a consumer avails from excess depends on her perception
 of what she considers necessary (which comprise of the external needs)
 rather than what is dictated by biology alone.
 The inclusion of peer effects - external needs which we measure as costs
 associated with the consumer's possessions - are thus necessary in a measure
 for excess.
 Both the basic-needs basket - the internal needs whose cost varies with
 observed prices in a given region - and the cost of possessions - the external
 needs that account for the social or spatial context of the consumer (identifie
d by the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 and the wealth measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 of the consumer) form the basis for our measure of excess.

 The measurement of excess considers the reference group's consumption level

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost of external needs - encompassing the maintenance and upkeep costs
 for the long-term durable goods a consumer inherits or purchases over time-
 increase the reference level of the consumer needs.
 We denote such cost of external needs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of needs of a consumer are therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi+\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is measure of the basic needs of a consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the wealth measure (proxied with the value of long-term durable goods
 etc.) and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 is the cost of needs in a particular locality.
 The consumer's consumption of everything else that is not included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 counts towards the consumer's excess (relative to her social reference
 comprising of wealth measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and demographic characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 By owning long-term durable goods (as a measure of wealth) 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the consumer essentially improves her social-reference and aims to get
 ahead of others by maximising her stock of durable goods relative to the
 reference possession level (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the reference ownership level for characteristic/identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 Another way to look at the consumer's long-term possessions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is that of a commitment which leads to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)+P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The net cost of needs provided by such a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and the expenditure on excess availed by the consumer constitute the total
 expenditure on non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 The total non-durable consumption for the consumer can thus be written
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu\psi P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})+\Psi(A)+P_{\psi}\psi$

Note that status is not considered an internal need using this approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for excess and the level
 of durable goods ownership she achieves while her internal needs remain
  independent of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both expensive
 durable goods and excess (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class internal needs
 of the consumer).
 Thus at a normative level, the difference between the status of a rich
 and that of a poor family is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 both the families combined with a disparate demand for excess in education.

To consider a direct utility function from the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,\nu,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 so far, notice that while the consumer does avail utility within her own
 social reference (specified by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

), a utility function should represent the case where all consumers from
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are permitted to rank (compare) each other as well.
 This is in fact a necessary condition for us to define a common utility
 function applicable to all consumers.
 Since status differences do exist across social reference groups as well
 (e.g.
 individuals in one region compare themselves to those from other regions),
 it follows that a consumer must get some utility from the identity of one's
 social reference in order for there to be a higher (lower) status utility
 obtained with a richer (poorer) identity (e.g.
 region, class etc.).
 If this weren't true - i.e.
 if the consumers could get utility inclusive-of-status only from their
 durable goods value and non-durable consumption - then there could be no
 point of indifference at which a consumer in the poor neighborhood could
 trade places (at least theoretically) with another in a richer neighborhood.
 For status consumption to have some utility to the consumer, the utility
 function - which is the same for all consumers - must also depend on group
 identity in some way so that a rich consumer with low-positioning could
 be potentially convinced to trade places with someone in the poor neighborhood
 who has a higher (local) social-positioning.
 The common utility function for all consumers and the status-related consumptio
n allow the small fish in a big pond - so to speak - to trade places with
 a big fish in a small pond.
 The utility from a reference group identity and the social positioning
 within the reference group are both key to the model for status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering an example to illustrate how two consumers may compete for a
 utility inclusive of status, let us assume there are consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

\begin_inset Formula $R$

 who live in poor (small pond) and rich (big pond) regions respectively
 so that their non-durable consumption levels are 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{P},c_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The average consumption levels in the regions they reside are 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

 Let's also assume that the values of their respective long-term durable
 goods bear the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}<A_{R}$
\end_inset

 The same is true for the average asset ownership of the regions 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$

 If we now consider the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P}<\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 then the per-head excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=\frac{c_{P}-\Psi_{P}}{\psi_{P}}$

 For the same needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{P}=\psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 and excess, ii) the needs cost the same for both the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and if iii) the utility were a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

, then there may never be any two values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{P},A_{P})\sim(\nu_{R},A_{R})$

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

\end_inset

 or being 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 - is necessary for this indifference to exist.
 Such a utility allows 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 to increase her excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}$

 so that she is indifferent to moving to an urban area even for a higher

Assuming that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular sense
 - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for visible consumption
 can be considered separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 For the empirical analyses, probably the most desirable feature of visibility
 based models is the separability of necessary items from conspicuous items
 - a property that is offered by assuming that the conspicuous items are
 futile (an argument attributed to Veblen).
 To accommodate this assertion, the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 includes items that are commonly understood to have exclusive signaling
 value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 In nascent modern economies of sub-Saharan Africa, however, we find that
 the bandwagon items such as electronics or cars pose obvious empirical
 concerns as they are hardly futile but also serve status needs due to the
 rapid and recent urbanisation in the economies.
 The futility assumption is not suitable for a model that is cognisant of
 wide differences in the long-term possessions of the consumers in a developing
 economy.
 We therefore use a different approach to status consumption that is based
 on the role that long-term durable goods may play towards status in an
 intertemporal setting.
 In an elaboration of the model with a varying cost of excess based on wealth
 levels, we also consider the conditions under which the substitution between
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 could be constrained.
 Such a model may be more generic to be applied across other developing
 economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the utility function we choose for long-term and short-term
 consumer goals does not view status consumption as futile but relates it
 with the attempts to alter a hierarchy of wealth and social identity -
 which we interpreted as clusters of long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 In this model, status cannot be changed by fulfillment of basic needs but
 is influenced both by long-term possessions and non-durable consumption
 of the consumer in an intertemporal setting.

Hierarchy of Consumer Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central claim that much of the model rests upon is that status is a
 part of the consumer's long-term utility.
 If not, the representative consumer in the model would have no reason to
 engage in status-related consumption.
 As there is something to be gained from non-durable status-consumption
 towards status (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a consumer
 can achieve a higher status in the model by the acquisition of durable
 goods through excess non-durable consumption relative to her social reference.
 While the non-durable consumption does not improve her ranking in the wealth
 order immediately, it may enhance social interactions, improve the consumer's
 self-image and is possible to achieve with an income lower than what may
 be required to acquire long-term durable items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The excess (non-durable consumption in excess of needs) thus provides both
 felicity and status advantage - since all else being the same, someone
 with a habit of a higher quality is likely to have more status than someone
 consuming a lower quality relative to her reference group.
 Status consumption thus fulfills both short-term and long-term goals of
 the consumer - the former with non-durable consumption and the later with
 ownership of durable goods.
 In fact the social characteristics such as residence, neighborhood or social
 class too could be viewed as cumulative long-term status items that are
 acquired over multiple generations.
 As long as one may assume that the rewards of status are passed on to the
 progeny, this view of social characteristics allows us to view the effect
 of a particular social reference group on status competitions.
 This temporal hierarchy of items allows us to view status consumption in
 the intertemporal framework - where some items are more temporary than
 others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Social identity may be the most permanent of all possessions, while the
 ownership of durable goods is more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 In an intertemporal substitution framework, the representative consumer,
 once having addressed her basic needs, therefore attempts to distribute
 her total (income) outlay into the three variables - needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and permanent ownership 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 does not change in her lifetime, a consumer may only be influenced by the
 characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (and not exercise her choice over it) - implying that all the consumers
 sharing the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would compete for status with both the durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 status-signalling through (non-durable) means (i.e.

 For example, having an urban residence opens up the access to a wider market
 for status goods.
 In household-related consumption, similarly, the high prices of housing
 may encourage a consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus

 However, she may improve the overall quality instead of buying a bigger

 Recall that the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\rho})$
\end_inset

 means that someone with a group that has a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 an urbanite or someone in a privileged social class) would be believed
 to be rich - even though her real wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 might be at same level with someone with a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 a rural person or someone with an underprivileged social class).
 What permits the decomposition of utility through

\end_inset

 into those through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the social observation (i.e.
 perception) of individuals in terms of identities that are established
 through long-term political or economic events.
 Thus an urbanite or someone with a privileged social class might not need

 someone from an under-privileged class who may have the same or even higher

 wealth.
 Yet since competitions for status matter within one's own social reference
 group and since inference of status is through social observation (perception),
 the individuals from respective social classes would continue to compare
 themselves within the same social reference group as well as those outside
 their social reference group - implying the relevance of both

An empirical analysis could follow with the above approach (see Appendix

 The additive utility imposes a particular structure on demand while permitting
 the consumer to simply substitute the lack of

 This is easily avoided with a cost-function approach (see Appendix I).

 An underlying assumption in the status consumption using excess and permanent

 This is an important claim for our model.
 While unexpressed differences in wealth may be the very cause of status
 consumption, it is also true that extremely wide differences in wealth
 or durable goods would segregate participation in status competitions across
 the groups of consumers having disparate levels of wealth.
 This condition which we refer to as separation is likely to occur in the
 severely unequal societies of the developing economies as well as the urban
 settings where various social groups are bound together through economic
 developments.
 For as long as wealth matters towards status and the consumers of disparate
 wealth levels participate in a common status competition, one can be assured
 that the higher wealth differences would segregate the status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical observations also confirm that the status items are tied to specific
 wealth levels - e.g.
 better food and beverages tend to indicate status at low wealth levels,
 luxury accessories at medium wealth levels and exclusive possessions (expensive
 watches, private jet access) at higher levels of wealth.
 There is evidence to the observation that the consumers with varied wealth-leve
ls often compete predominantly with those in their proximity (see Chai et
 al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Status competitions thrive because we are consciously averse to committing
 ourselves to the implications of a long-term wealth order.
 A psychological need to maintain a certain self-image and dismiss the role
 of known wealth differences to our near future necessitates the status
 consumption at varied wealth-levels.
 So while the differences in wealth drive the excess, it is also likely
 to be segregated based on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-levels i.e.
 the status item from someone else's 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band may not be of much value to oneself - a luxury watch may be worth
 only its sale value to someone who toils the earth for food.
 We can thus establish that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 are always associated with an asset-band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

To illustrate the separation more quantiatively, let's consider a simple
 example where consumers 1 and 2 with wealth measures 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 compete for status.
 Given that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

, let's also assume at first that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=0$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 they are individuals with the same basic needs and there are no new durable
 goods to be purchased).
 With the same set of basic needs, the outlay for excess would be higher
 for consumer 1 if

\end_inset

 .
 So while as such consumer 2 has higher status 1 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

, the consumer 1 might have a higher status than consumer 2 in the competition.
 While 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 are comparable it is also possible that the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}-A_{1}$
\end_inset

 is so high than consumer 2 may never have a status higher than consumer
 1.
 More formally, there is a critical difference in wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

 between the consumers 1 and 2 so that any difference in wealth for the
 poorer consumer 1 beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

 would be insurmountable with excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu'$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda=A_{2}-A_{1}$

\end_inset

The market for status through excess thus exists for wealth differences
 within 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If one could view 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 as the price of items that indicate status through excess, their demand
 would be lower when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda>\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 when there is no market for status through excess.
 Put differently, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 It follows that excess is optimal only within the range

Notice that the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 - which correspond to the asset band are of commodities rather than goods
 (we consider combined excess in food, quality of entertainment etc.
 and associated prices with it rather than the items).
 As an example, consider how unavailability of items of higher quality -
 which evidently separate status competitions - can be viewed in terms of
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 .
 The opportunities for excess are necessarily lower in areas with no availabilit
y of higher quality items.
 Since prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 are associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

, there are two possibilities for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 in the two two regions - first is that the region with lower excess opportuniti
es corresponds the same band
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 as the region with higher excess opportunities (i.e.
 if the consumer in both regions have the largely same set of durable goods).

is same for the two regions, the region with less excess opportunities would
 necessarily have lower 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

.
 The second (more likely) possibility is that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 are different across the regions.
 In such a case, the overall quality of life in the two region can be compared
 only when considering all of

Conditions for Separation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status competitions comprise both of excess and wealth, we look at
 the constraints on excess 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 could cause (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Pnu_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 To illustrate these constraints let us consider two consumers in the urban
 and rural areas where

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (more assets need more maintenance).
 Assuming that the cost of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the same for the two consumer and the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{rural}(A)$
\end_inset

 change as functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in the same way, the excess consumption for the urban and rural consumers
 would depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{rural}(A)$
\end_inset

 are the same, an urban consumer who is poorer in absolute terms i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $A_{urban}<A_{rural}$
\end_inset

 would have a excess budget (
\begin_inset Formula $\because x-\Psi(A_{rural})-\delta<x-\Psi(A_{urban})-\delta$
\end_inset

).
 Also, given richer residents in the urban area, the rural consumer's relative
 position is higher than that of urban consumer.
 Since both 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 matter towards status consumption, separation is likely since the rural
 consumer has both a higher relative position and a higher budget for excess.
 The separation is in fact certain if the rural consumer also faces a lower
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 than the urban consumer.
 Similarly, when 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{urban}>A_{rural}$
\end_inset

the excess budget of the rural consumer is higher (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A_{urban})>\Psi(A_{rural})\Rightarrow x-\Psi(A_{urban})-\delta<x-\Psi(A_{rural})-\delta$
\end_inset

.
 Since the urban consumer now may or may not have a higher relative position
 than the rural consumer, a separation condition is avoided only if the
 rural consumer has a lower cost 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 than the urban consumer.
 With the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 (which is observed in the consumption diary as costs associated with assets)
 for the urban and rural consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 thus determines whether separation may exist in for urban and rural consumers
 or not.

Separation is the condition where competitions with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 are diminished due to differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 Our empirical goal is to find out the degree to which they are diminished
 across wealth hierarchies.
 Based on the Equation

, extreme differences in

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 or
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 could all result in separation.
 We now detail how each of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 could result in a separation.
 Viewing the separation due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 first, consider two consumers in successive bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 who both have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 .
 Extreme differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 evidently segments the status goods across 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

) and allows the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 to dominate the comparisons between consumers from band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Second, the separation is caused by 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 differences - which directly influence the excess consumption.
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 does not change for two consumers having the same total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the successive bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\mathscr{A}}=\Psi_{\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}}=\Psi$
\end_inset

, consider that how a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})>P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 prevents a separation due to
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})}<\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})}$
\end_inset

 (since the indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})},\mathscr{A})=u(\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})},\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 is possible for the two consumers)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The consumers outside of their

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In other words, the consumers could exchange places with each other if
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})>P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that if we find a substitution in the successive bands i.e.
 consumers reducing the excesses (facing the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

 across the band) as they move to the band

 we could dismiss a separation.
 Similarly when

\end_inset

 , we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})}>\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})}$
\end_inset

 and a necessarily implied separation would be observed as a lack of substitutio
n in data i.e.
 consumers increasing excess as they move to the higher band.
 Third, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 in certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 could also cause separation through similar constraints (e.g.
 with utilities that are only available within the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 Assuming that we have 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})=P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 for two consumers having total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the successive bands, separation is ensured when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}}<\Psi_{\mathscr{A}}$
\end_inset

 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{x-\Psi_{\mathscr{A}}-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})},\mathscr{A})=u(\frac{x-\Psi_{\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}}-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})},\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})$

 Thus the cost-function

 we rewrite the consumer budget as:

The subsistence costs therefore correspond to

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Delta_{t}=0$

 due to our assumption of subsistence level not requiring any long-term
 possessions).
 A higher budget in the specification could be thus either spent on excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu\psi$

 or more long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 As the consumer acquires more durable goods her outlay could fall if the

 rise.
 Notice that

 by assumption and that the life-cycle effects are already part of the model

-group having the higher subsistence costs would have lower outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards status consumption.
 For a consumer closer to the subsistence level, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 would be low and a rise in subsistence costs would mean a minimal outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 (see Equation

).
 On the other hand, a consumer further from subsistence i.e.
 with an outlay higher than subsistence level may substitute between owning
 more durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 more comfortably.
 The rise in subsistence prices for such a consumer lowers her budget for
 excess but not as much compared to a consumer who survives closer to subsistenc
e levels.
 That lowering the outlay at higher levels of the outlay does not drop the
 bliss (utility) as sharply as closer to the subsistence is evident from
 the shape of the PIGLOG curve as well (see Appendix).

Status competitions are spurred as subsistence becomes cheaper and bliss
 becomes expensive in the PIGLOG formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of this claim is proven trivially.
 Subsistence becoming cheaper makes sure that more consumers participate
 in the status consumption.
 With the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we can see that rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
reduce the outlay for excess as well as permanent goods and thus discourage
 status competition.
 To explain how price-rises in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) could affect the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) for the second part , recall that the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is only with respect to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is subject to the demand from consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 , the consumers within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 competing with excess would drive the price for excess
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

.
 Since the demand for status goods is limited to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 the substitution between permanent-ownership and excess is not as if every
 individual has a fixed demand for  excess which she adjusts as the price
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rise and fall.
 Instead, when 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is driven by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 alone, then a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may create more competition for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods leading to a rise in the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 The rise of prices of assets for consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 thus raises the price of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 On other other hand, too much of a drop in prices of assets could make
 the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 .
 This is because if the rise in prices of assets is so much that a redistributio
n of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (wealth) ensues i.e.
 the consumers may sell their 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and move to the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, then the significant rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could lower the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 goods.
 Equivalently, when there is a small drop in price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, more consumers within the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band would stock 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 would fall.
 Once agains, the fall in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could be so much that there would be a lot many consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band and the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods would rise.
 This dynamics exists because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is specific to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and prices of assets as well as excess are associated with competitions
 for status (see Bilancini et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BILANCINIStatusRanking2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for similar arguments).
 One could say, loosely speaking, that the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 due to price is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lumpy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that it occurs only for big changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and is irrelevant for small changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 where it's actually the positional demand that dominates the price dynamics
 - ensuring that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for a particular band would not change is insensitive to small changes
 in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To consider the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 as the price for excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 changes, now consider how a rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 through introduction of new quality goods (newer technology, products etc.)
 could affect the prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Once again the price of excess increases the status of only a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
 As a newer item is introduced, all other items might not have as much value
 towards status any more and the new item - having a higher price - would
 raise the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 slightly.
 If the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands are intact, the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would drop as 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rises due to a new item.
 Here, since excess is always tied to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, a significant rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 through introduction of new items would make it worthwhile to downgrade
 or upgrade one's 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and enjoy a less intense 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in another 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band .
 The association of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 implies that the changes in price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 may never cause a redistribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the help of above dynamics we can now explain how bliss becoming more
 expensive through rise of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 amounts to the intensification of status competitions.
 Specifically, as small rises of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 move together, a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for consumer above subsistence does little to end the need for status competiti
ons as long as wealth or asset hierarchies stay the same.
 Without changes that transform the asset hierarchies, we can argue that
 bliss becoming more expensive amounts to more intense status competition.

Empirical Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clear limitation of the excess approach is that it does not differentiate
 an excess in food items from an excess in clothes.
 While in an itemwise analysis one considers the elasticities of status
 goods explicitly, excess treats a rural overspending on a wedding ceremony
 the same as the urban spending on cable TV subscriptions.
 The excess approach is favoured nevertheless since it solves two key measuremen
t error issues.
 First is the lack of observed prices for categories such as clothing or
 entertainment in the survey data.
 Due to severe measurement errors in measure elasticities caused by using
 unit prices (i.e.
 using average expenditure on clothing as prices in the respective areas)
 we use the excess approach to limit ourselves to testing only to test if
 excesses are separated across levels of asset-ownership hierarchies or
 not (see Gibson et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for measurement errors with unit prices).
 The second issue is the mixing of daily-diary and monthly diary which may
 also results in measurement errors with calibration of item elasticities
 (see Deaton-Dreze 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who note this problem and use the ownership levels of the various durable
 goods as a proxy for living standards to get around measurement error problems).
 The excess approach avoids this issues by separating the needs from quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An empirical concern can also be raised due base level of (basic) needs
 that we use to determine excess.
 One could argue against the notion of excess by saying that the needs vary
 significantly within an economy e.g.
 urban expenditures - transportation or entertainment - are needs in the
 urban area in a way that they aren't in a rural area.
 Such perceived differences in needs are handled in the model with either
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 or a part of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})\times\nu$
\end_inset

 .
 When the urban expenditures in the example are part of

e.g.
 transportation ), the urban consumer - who has the same total expenditure
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as the rural consumer - has a less excess outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})\times\nu$
\end_inset

 due to a higher needs (inclusive of transportation).
 The urban consumer with a lower excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 therefore is set to balance the utility from the trait of being urban (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{urban}$
\end_inset

) with having less excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 than the rural consumer.
 This is possible since use both 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the context of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to compare status for two consumers.
 Therefore for needs such as entertainment - which are always considered
 part of excess - one considers the asset ownership for comparison of status
 as well.
 Since the urban areas are always richer on the whole than rural areas,
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})$
\end_inset

 is necessarily different from 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{rural})$
\end_inset

 and the higher excess for the urban consumer availing more entertainment
 is always viewed in relation to the asset hierarchy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 which the urban and rural consumer belong to.
 Given our empirical goal to test whether excess is different across asset
 hierarchies, we represent the consumers' environment with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 and avoid relying on the varying notions of subjective needs .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our reluctance towards using a environment-adjusted notion of needs is for
 two reasons - first because there are no universal set of needs other than
 basic needs that we may agree upon.
 The notion of subjective needs always carries a certain bias in the classificat
ion of items - evidently since a rich person's needs must always appear
 futile to the poorer individual.
 Second, while it is true that an urban consumer having the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as the rural consumer may “feel” that her entertainment needs are higher
 due to peer effects, it is not consumption data itself that tells us whether
 the consumers move to urban areas to achieve a higher status or that the
 residents of the urban areas feel more pressures which represent a higher
 entertainment need (this is the core of the debate between habit and quality
 in the demand literature).
 We prefer not to make either of the assertions and treat lifestyle differences
 in the rural area and the urban area with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

-dependent excess prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, instead of arguing that certain needs are more important in
 the urban area, we argue only that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 in the urban area is different and could create a separation from the rural
 area - in the sense that the status competitions in the urban area may
 become independent of the status competitions in the rural area - leading
 most rural consumers to have either a higher status than the urban consumers
 (or vice versa).
 Here, it is worth emphasising also that we remove fixed-effects in the
 recorded excess budget through a fixed effects analysis.

 (which depends on

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (within or across

) vary in a population.
 If one were to elicit a function 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

 depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 , a weaker economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would imply a weak 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-based separation.
 Stronger dependence of excesses on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 -ownership bands would similarly imply a strong separation.
 This is simply because separation in empirical data amounts to substitution
 of excesses between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands.
 Therefore if there is no separation across identified bands 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$

 , one would observe that for a significant number of consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\nu,A)=u(\nu',A')$
\end_inset

 for the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of the cost-function approach, the consumers in bands

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 paying the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,P_{\nu}(A))$

We therefore use two metrics representing the local and national level of
 hierarchies for our tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The local hierarchy is represented with a 
\series bold
relative-position (RP)
\series default
 score - which is the ratio of wealth of the higher band to that of the
 consumer.
 We infer the logarithm wealth of the higher band for a consumer as 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{th}$
\end_inset

 quantile of the logarithm of assets-value (AV) in the local area (determined
 with region and district) where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 higher than the consumer's own logarithm AV rank.
 Thus with 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.1$
\end_inset

 in a group of 100 consumers in a given area, a higher-band wealth for a
 consumer having 20% percentile rank in log-AV would be the wealth 30% quantile
 wealth in the area.
 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 score effectively serves as a local relative assert poverty metric - a
 higher RP means that the person is poorer relative to the richer neighbour.
 Being rich in a predominantly rich area would result in a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 for a consumer than being poor in a rich neighbourhood.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The sectorial poverty (
\begin_inset Formula $SP$
\end_inset

) metric looks at the log difference in median wealth of the band richer
 district than the consumer's own district.
 All consumers in the same district have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $SP$
\end_inset

 score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above metrics are used to comment on whether the local peer effects
 are more important to the consumer than the wider-level wealth differences
 or not.
 More specifically, a comparison of the dependence of excesses on local
 asset-difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 vs national asset-differences 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 helps us comment whether the differences at local levels may be more important
 to the consumer than at national levels.
 If excesses depends weakly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 but strongly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

, status competitions are limited to the local region and the region is
 relatively separated from other regions.
 Local peer effects 
\bar under
can be said to 
\bar default
dominate the differences in wealth at higher levels when excesses depend
 weakly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 but strongly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 (this could happen either if the consumer  resides in a relatively rich
 region or in a relatively poor region).
 On the other hand, if we find a weak significance on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 but a stronger dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

, then local separation exists and the rich consumer may be competing at
 a wider (national) level.
 It is indeed also possible that there is weak significance across both
 hierarchies (implying that excesses are not particularly separated at either
 levels) or that there is strong dependence across both hierarchies (the
 consumers have their excesses within the limits the position in the local
 hierarchies and are then also separated by regional wealth at the wider
 level).
 The empirical results from the Tanzanian have been interpreted using these
 arguments.

Cost of Needs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each wave of the survey, we use both the consumption diary of food items
 and the recall diary of non-food items to compute the cost of needs of
 the consumer - summing up the expenditure on the items that are considered
 necessities.
 The necessities are gathered from the four categories of consumption identified
 in the LSMS data - food, household, energy and transport.
 The cost of basic needs is therefore simply the cost of minimal requirements
 in every category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this interpretation of basic (internal) needs, we rely on the market-prices
 available in the survey for each locality.
 For example, under food category, we obtain the minimum requires for carbohydra
tes, fat, protein and fruits-vegetables categories and the prices of the
 cheapest item in each sub-category of food.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - is calculated at the level using the prices of the
 items recorded in the survey (the prices are recorded at the district level
 as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket is a diet of
 cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - these being the cheapest items
 in most regions.
 The cost of the basket thus calculated is much higher in the urban areas
 than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 This cost of baskset is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the basic cost of needs per household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LamSmith2012Kerosene"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and https://energypedia.info/ for data on typical energy usage in the developing
 countries).
 For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 Under transport category, the public-transport costs and petrol consumption
 costs (which in turn depend on whether a consumer owns a motor-bike or
 a car) are considered not as part of basic needs but as part of the costs
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-level including the means of transport (see Table

\begin_layout Subsection

Excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In empirical terms, excess is a measure of how far in value the consumption
 is from the local cost of reference level needs.
 For food commodities, standardising a set of needs general across the populatio
n is relatively easy - as the cost of needs in food would simply be the
 cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area for the total number
 of households in the family.
 But when the context of consumption is not limited to food and employment,
 the ideas of health and autonomy (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and Doyal-Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) require some justification based on the consumer's environment.
 In the particular context of Tanzania, the differences between urban or
 rural settings drive our consideration of subsistence costs 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

.
 The measurement error for the cost of internal needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 of the household - i.e.
 the product of the number of units in the family and observed price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 - is minimal due to the availability of market prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 at the district level in the survey and the detailed record of the members
 of the households (including their cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - which we use to measure the needs of the household).
 Notice that we observe excess not at the level of the individual but at
 the level of a group of individuals with characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (which could also be associated with an 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that all costs incurred due to maintenance, usage and upkeep of the
 long-term durable goods are included in the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and would thus bear a higher non-durable
 consumption level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical goods would not have
 the same non-durable consumption).
 Revisiting the earlier example, consider a consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 with a refrigerator and another consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 without a refrigerator who both have the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and the same set of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 .
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{E_{L}}<\Psi_{E_{H}}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{E_{L}}>c_{t}-\Psi_{E_{H}}$
\end_inset

) .
 But does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 While the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity groups
 (over energy or durable goods for example).
 Strictly speaking, the quality in one commodity can be hardly substituted
 with the quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality can be meaningful in the setting only as long
 as a total cost of basic needs level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is considered.
 The notion of excess - subject to such a level - is a way to assess overall
 quality in non-durable consumption.
 If having a refrigerator is not considered a basic need, we can say nothing
 more for a comparison of quality than that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

.

Durable goods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the durable goods in the recall diaries (see items with category
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

assets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{itemsclassification}
\end_layout

\end_inset

), a particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey ranges from short-term
 durable items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets
 such as land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 Our classification of long-term durable goods is based on intergenerational
 transfers - so an item is included in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and thus its cost of maintenance are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) only if it can be passed on through generations
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An empirical criterion for consideration of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is also that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 should increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (there are no assets that can be maintained without any costs).
 This avoids an assets-interpretation of certain social characteristics
 such as education or club-membership - which may be acquired over a life-time,
 require some investment (fees for education or club membership) and even
 have a definite value in the market (e.g.
 employment market).
 Such personal characteristics (e.g.
 education) are not considered as assets simply because they don't carry
 any maintenance costs.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The details of records include the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 the household expects by selling the durable good in the market at the
 time of the survey.
 We refer to the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 that the household expects by selling the durable good in the market as
 marked-to-market average or simply mtm average in the foregoing discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that as a recall value, the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 is particularly sensitive to measurement errors.
 Recorded by the survey at two different time-points spread across two years
 (let's call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs can change over the period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) may be significantly different from the cost reported in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 This could simply be because of a different member of the same household
 providing the estimate in the two different years.
 The problem could also get worsened due to two further issues - first the
 waves are not a panel-data set in the true sense - the household visited
 in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is likely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 but very unlikely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-2$
\end_inset

.
 Second - a significant number of households are split in multiple households
 - thus permitting more measurement errors as the new household members
 recall the cost of owned items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to above issues with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

, we use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods (i.e.
 the mtm average) as it is not recalled from consumer's memory but instead
 reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time - an
 issue can be handled by averaging over 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets is achieved by multiplying th number of assets
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Around 10% of the households that were split in the periods 2010-2012 and
 in 2012-2014 have been ignored for our analyses.

To establish that observing budget ratio
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$

 is an measure for excess as appropriate as the amount spent towards excess
 - which the consumers compete with - let’s consider three consumers who
 are rich (with assets valued at 4,000,000), middle-income (assets valued
 at 900,000) and poor (assets valued at 10,000).
 If the maintenance costs was simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A}$
\end_inset

 (for the value of asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) we observe basic needs costs and total expenses, the excess can be calculated
 as shown in the tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The consumer spending more on assets in Table

\end_inset

 as a lower expenditure on excess and thus a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Consider now that if the rich in the example has both a higher excess and
 higher asset value then there the separation condition applies and there
 can be no competition among the consumers.
 This is the state of the status competition in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Lowwnu"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, if per-head excess of rich and poor consumers overlap
 we have less separation - as is the case in Table

\begin_layout Standard
[Robustness Subjective Well-being] To test the robustness of our measure
 of excess, we use the subjective well-being data from the survey.
 If excesses are used to offset existing wealth hierarchies, we should find
 that those who are not satisfied with their financial status would have
 higher excess.
 Our finding is that after accounting for wealth levels (durable goods ownership
) those who are satisfied have less recorded excess.
 That said, we cannot use this data to conclude whether a consumer has higher
 excess due to not having a any options to purchase long-term assets or
 due to extreme peer pressures in her asset-band.
 What we can ascertain however is that for the same total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, those with less assets consistently feel dissatisfied and have higher
 excess levels.
 The exception are the indeed the extremely unsatisfied consumers who are
 also often extremely poor and have low excess.
 Similarly extremely satisfied consumers in the higher asset band also have
 less excess.
 Here, too one must not rely on how excess is being spent the different
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands.

, the main goal of the empirical analysis is to understand to what extent
 the separation condition has a role to play in the status consumption.
 If a poor consumer who is out of place in a rich area (thus with a high
 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$

\begin_inset Formula $A$

 excess.
 If there is a separation on the other hand, this would either be futile

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This distinction cannot be made by looking at the consumption data alone.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - thus leading to a poor significance of the 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 score.
 The BW score similarly explains if the separation may apply to the entire
 region (district) the consumer is a part of.
 Assuming the same distribution of assets, an economically poorer regions
 might see a different pattern for excess consumption than the rich region.

[Conclusions] If excess is lower for out-of-place consumers (with asset
 differences in the neighborhood) then there is separation.
 We find no evidence of that.
 Being in a rich area suppresses w_nu and being out of place has a positive
 effect.
 The separation is therefore limited in urban areas - more out of place
 consumers (who are more encouraged to stay within there own level) have
 a strong positive economic significance on w_nu.
 Here it is worth noting that when extremely unequal communtiies are being
 compared – the opportunities of quality would be extremely limited.
 So individual care more about their local circumstances because they really
 can’t care about quality.
 If I live in a neighborhood where the asset-neighbors are richer in compared
 to asset-neighbours in the entire country, excess is actually lower.
 It can’t be because quality is lower in the richer areas – it must be because
 demand for quality is less and individuals are spending more on assets
 – that are available in the relative rich areas (this is sensitive to how
 assets are classified).
 The main observatioin is that despite not as high A, we see higher Psi
 in the middle-A individuals – likely among urban individuals.
 Putting both together, the out of place is actually more dominant – meaning
 that competing with the rich the dominant trend – solely because of how
 the economy is structured.
 We also test with the additional metric of individual who are aware of
 the same language (we look at the ratio of people who speak English in
 the band to the total number of people in the band – this effects needs
 to be taken together with others control variables) – but social differences
 based on language do not seem significant.

An issue that may be raised with the above conclusions is that the basic
 needs of the consumer may not be reliably determined with the price of
 a needs basket alone.
 To detail this issue further, consider an example where we have expenditure
 data on phones for a 1000 families and we know that the 200 of the 100
 consumers are rich, 400 are middle-income and 400 are poor.
 Assume that we also have the data on age and composition of the families.
 If we observe that some of them have much higher monthly expenditure on
 phones than others, then choosing

basic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 expenditure on phone as the fees for landline, we may declare all expense
 higher than the landline costs as the excess.
 An issue could be raised by arguing that the individual’s needs are not
 down to landline costs – as a consumer might have more family members living
 away, she may be conducting occupational calls using her phone, have her
 partner living far away from her or she may be might just too talkative.
 Such effects however are always either observed in data (such as the number
 of family members, the regional effects etc.) or can be removed with differencin
g observations spread over time (e.g.
 with a fixed effects estimation).
 That is the reason why prices being observed locally is key to our analysis
 of excess.
 The notion of excess only makes sense at the level of district since the
 market-observed prices are local prices.
 National level prices cannot be used to calculate excess at local levels.
 As long as we can assume as that landline is indeed the basic expense,
 we know how the excess varies in the population without a knowledge of
 the prices of every expensive phone variety.
 It can also be said whether separation exists or not in the population
 of 1000 families, by observing if the excess could is aligned with the
 observed A-band (i.e.
 if the consumers in the poorer band P have consistently a different excess
 from those in the richer band R).
 The analysis is equivalent to the one where expenditure on particular types
 of phones is available in the survey.

WHAT DOES THAT TELL ME ABOUT STATUS CONSUMPTION IN TANZANIA? Are we talking
 about separation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, the differences in urban and rural lifestyles play a major
 role in the difference in durable good purchases as well as excess.
 This is in particular due to the availability of electricity being limited
 to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for - thus are more likely
 to deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption in an environment of uneven prices for excess consumption.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived upside risk in future wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the consumers competing with those with higher
 wealth than themselves.
 Extreme wealth differences mean a crystallisation of socio-economic differences
 and an evident separation of quality and visible consumption.

[SEPARATION THERE OR NOT THAT IS THE QUESTION]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in wealth and the segregation of quality of life in the
 developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they may be in the
 segregated societies in developed economies).
 Therefore there is a need to be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries - if the distribution of durable
 goods in the economy have not been considered.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, it cannot be denied that visible consumption is of importance
 in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption and is worth exploring in its own right - but the
 considerations of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership are
 also appropriate not only in the context of marriages but in a generalised
 context of status consumption across economies.
 Marriages - like much of visible consumption - are both an indication of
 one's social status as well as a potential for advancement in social ranking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rural and urban differences in the developing world also fit into the
 model for permanent ownership and excess that we have used in the empirical
 analyses.
 The differences in wealths and consumer's futility of status consumption
 in presence of wide differences allow us to understand how status competitions
 could work under severe inequalities.
 Standardising demand in the market for status using the model may thus
 help us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across various economies.
