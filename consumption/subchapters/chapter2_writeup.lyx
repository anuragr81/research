\begin_layout Title
Status consumption under wealth inequalities

- a case study in Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role played by wealth
 inequalities in the varied contexts of developing economies has been explored
 less often.
 We use a model for status consumption that view the expenditure in excess
 of needs relative the permanent ownership as non-durable status consumption
 and comment on the opposing effects of peer influences and extreme wealth
 differences in the developing countries.
 Using the consumption data from the Tanzanian LSMS survey we discuss how
 a segregation of status competition based on extreme wealth differences
 and price heterogeneity could characterise status consumption in a developing
 economy.
 
\shape default
We believe that the model may be more generic to be applied across other
 developing economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical studies in both developed and developing economies have associated
 social segmentation in an economy with disproportionate spending on conspicuous
 items

.
 While such disparities are often explained with social-reference groups,
 the ways in which status consumption differ under the environment of extreme
 poverty in developing countries has been explored less often.
 Noting the prevalent wealth inequalities, we reexamine the notion of status
 in developing economies with a particular focus on the opposing direction
 of peer effects and the effects of wealth differences on status consumption.
 On one hand, status consumption is enhanced with peer effects but on the
 other, it would be discouraged under extreme wealth differences that the
 consumer may not overcome.
 The very ideas of pecuniary emulation - i.e.
 the notion that the habits of the rich are emulated by the poorer consumers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 - must therefore reconsidered since extreme wealth differences may have
 the effect of making status consumption appear futile to the poor consumers.
 Seeking conditions under which the demand for status goods is reduced in
 spatially or economically separated reference groups

\end_layout

\end_inset

 we use a model for status consumption that views status in a context of
 wide wealth-band differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Treating wealth bands as relevant reference points in the empirical data,
 we argue that a consumer both compares herself with reference consumption
 of other groups which she doesn't belong and to those within her own group.
 Status consumption is thus observed relative to a particular wealth bands
 the consumers belong to in the economy.
 This role of status consumption derives from a social-deference view of
 status that has been embraced in many economic studies
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Status consumption in such a view is an attempt to offset the effects of
 existing wealth hierarchies towards status.
 Any two consumers in the model must compete with each other for status
 using both the permanent ownership of items and the excess non-durable
 consumption (i.e.
 consumption above the cost of needs) .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical measurement of the permanent ownership of items uses the long
 term durable goods data available for every household in the survey.
 The excess non-durable consumption - which is defined with respect to a
 particular asset band (assessed with permanent ownership data) - is measured
 as excess over the cost of needs.
 The cost of needs used for excess in turn comprises of the cost of basic
 needs varying across regions and the cost of owning long-term goods that
 define the asset-band (costs associated with maintenance of long-term durable
 goods are also available in the survey).
 After adjusting for her needs, a consumer is meant to optimise the utility
 she obtains from both excess and long-term possessions.
 Social or spatial characteristics matter to the consumer in the model through
 both the durable goods cluster which the consumer belongs to and the price
 of needs that the consumer is exposed to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In popular culture, status consumption often evokes images of wasteful expenditu
re and exclusive possessions that provide no economic value other than an
 attraction to people of equal affluence.
 We find this view rather inadequate for the utility provided by status
 consumption - which we believe is necessarily tied with social ranking.
 The view of status consumption as a waste presents an obvious issue with
 deciding whether a consumer's newly acquired wealth - whether it be jewelry
 of acquisition of undervalued land or property - is to be considered a
 part of her high-status necessities or wasteful conspicuous consumption.
 Since we have no way of knowing the intentions of consumers by evaluating
 their consumption diaries, we can focus only on the measurements of existing
  wealth and a notion of basic necessities instead of using a normative
 definition of the level of status needs for the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the model we specify, the dependence of a measure of excess
 relative to a wealth band on basic needs and costs of assets in the band
 – implies that the rich in an economy do not inherently have needs different
 from the poor - instead only disparate costs of assets and different levels
 of excess.
 Notice also that our notion of excess excludes any maintenance costs for
 the long-term possession the role of which towards status is considered
 explicitly.
 Thus if one owns a car, the petrol used up for driving is not an excess
 and contributes only to the cost of bearing assets.
 As consumer are meant to use both excess and long-term ownership for status
 competitions excess and since excess vary according to a particular asset-clust
er (band)
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 one belongs, the idiosyncratic habits average out for the notion of excess
 with respect to a wealth band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 This is admissible since the empirical claim that we wish to test is whether
 non-durable status consumption - viewed as excess over needs - is dominated
 by status competition in the local wealth hierarchy or those among the
 consumers of similar wealth in a spatial proximity.
 The significance of the metrics related to wealth at local and national
 levels help us comment if local peer effects are more important for the
 consumer than the differences in wealth at observed the higher level in
 the wider economy.
 We believe that this detail of non-durable status consumption is more relevant
 to how status motivations influence urban migration or demand for industrial
 items than the analysis of visible items in the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key appeal of the above approach is that unlike with the studies in
 visible consumption, one need not rely on the assumption that status goods
 are futile.
 While the futility assumption implicitly ensures the separability of demand
 for visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004,ireland_signals"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in an empirical analysis, it neither encompasses status consumption fully
 nor does it satisfy a desired criterion for visibility in bandwagon items
 such as electronics or cars that have clear utility in the regular sense
 apart from providing relative status advantage.
 We feel therefore that the futility assumption may be inadequate for the
 representation of status consumption in a developing economy where both
 wealth differences and disparate economic conditions have a more conspicuous
 role to play.
 The notion of status using the permanent ownership and a more general notion
 of quality (which includes any high-price non-durable consumption) allows
 us to move beyond proxies of cultural contexts (e.g.
 using visibility surveys
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen has explored the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 - but Veblen hardly dwells upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

Assisted with the developments in game theory and an improvement in the
 quality of microdata from consumption surveys, an interest in Veblen's
 observations has been revived in the recent years (see Frank

 We argue that this recent attention to status consumption need not to be
 viewed asunder from the consumer demand literature on habit-formation (see
 for example Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The empirical literature on quality in consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

could be extended to view status consumption if a suitable relation between
 consumption and status can be established.
 This relationship may allow us to investigate status consumption in the
 context of developing countries where it is less likely to be observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of status most commonly used in literature is one where it is
 seen as a static long-term characteristics of the consumer.
 The view presents an obvious paradox with respect to consumption as there
 cannot be any utility from status-consumption if status were only accumulated
 over a long-term.
 One can easily resolve the paradox by considering that status is subject
 to change with consumption - just the way it is shaped by income or education
 (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 where status - like in many studies in sociology and health sciences -
 is used as a vector education or income ).
 We thus use a dynamic view of status provided by Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Having been widely embraced in the economic studies, this approach views
 status as a wealth-based ranking order that can be altered by the consumer
 with consumption.
 A consumer achieves status utility through status consumption by moving
 herself up in a ranking order that is otherwise determined by wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wealth bands form the immediate reference group of the consumer where
 status consumption is observed.
 The context of wealth differences has been explored less often in the literatur
e on status consumption (except for some studies that explore the effect
 of income inequality on conspicuous consumption e.g.

).
 The wealth-band based approach differs from the studies on visible consumption
 that explore the role of social identities in status consumption (see Chao

 More specifically, we do not assume that the status-indicating goods in
 a developing country must be the same as those that are considered

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We argue that the wealth differences - which are the necessary context
 of status consumption - may be far too wide for the limited visible items
 available in the developing economies where industrial development is concentra
ted into few urban areas.

).
 The treatment of social identities as wealth bands however requires us
 to validate empirically that social identities are indeed aligned with
 wealth inequalities - as there is enough evidence to suggest that the reference
 groups defined by social identities limit the status consumption within
 themselves (see Chai et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Treating social characteristics as separate wealth band allow us to test
 if the non-durable status consumption - viewed as consumption in excess
 of one's needs relative to one's reference wealth band - responds to consumptio
n level of the own wealth band or to that of the neighbouring wealth-bands.

\series bold
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical analysis of excess relative to wealth band relies on two key
 measurements - the long-term 
\series bold
possessions
\series default
 of a consumer (proxied with the stock of durable goods possessed by consumer
 - inclusive of housing, land and other long-term assets) and the non-durable
 consumption in excess of needs - which we hereforth refer to as 
\series bold
excess
\series default
.
 Notice that the fulfillment of basic needs does not offer an advantage
 to the consumer in a status competition.
 A consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) measured as excess would have a higher status than another consumer
 with same needs who consumes less quality (excess).
 So long as the basic needs of the two consumers being compared are the
 same and their difference in needs arise only out of their long-term possession
s, the addressing of needs alone does not provide any status utility to
 the consumers.
 It follows that if there is any status related utility to be derived from
 non-durable consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from excess.
 Conversely, any status in a particular reference group that is not signaled
 with excess must come out of the possession of the long-term possessions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement of excess from empirical data requires i) the costs associated
 with the durable goods and ii) higher-than-required consumption based on
 a minimum necessary consumption.
 The costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of durable goods are
 easy to obtain as they are often available as part of the consumer diary.
 Similarly, the variation in the cost of a standard basket of basic needs
 across the regions and districts is often available with the market prices
 in a survey.
 Therefore, as long as the basic needs of the consumer and the possession
 of the long-term durable goods can be determined in an economy, the 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
can be readily estimated for every consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The caveat with this needs-based approach is that our empirical measurement
 of excess becomes dependent on what is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the consumer (at least as much as it is for the very definition of

).
 The very idea of basic needs can be controversial when on one hand, we
 have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective preferences
 (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, a commonly-understood set of needs could supersede
 a consumer's subjective wants.
 To fix a particular definition of needs for own empirical analyses, we
 rely on both internal needs and external needs and lean towards an objective
 middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy - in addition to health - as basic needs of the consumer.
 Thus the internal needs of the consumer can be fixed without shunning the
 idea that the needs should vary across cultural contexts.
 We view basic (internal) needs of the consumer are requirements not meeting
 which would lead to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory
 argued for by Doyal and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Such basic needs are easy to identify in the consumer dairy and are distinguish
ed from the costs (maintenance, fees etc.) associated with durable goods
 possessed by the consumer.
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite.
 A starch diet fulfilling the set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

basic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dietary needs can thus be ruled out.
 The role of basic needs in our empirical analysis designate the requirements
 the internal needs are common across all consumers regardless of their
 social context.
 The price of such basic needs is then calculated based on the market observed
 prices available in the survey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the ideas of health and autonomy define the basic (or internal) needs
 of the consumer in a given cultural setting, the non-durable status consumption
 is hardly limited to one's basic needs.
 While the former can be determined with the biological needs of the household
 alone (represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - the number of household-members, number of children, individual age,
 body weight etc.), the latter is viewed as a notion of excess that must
 encompass what the consumer feels important rather than what she is supposed
 to feel important.
 For example, the question of whether lodging/home-ownership or the primary
 education of children in the area where a consumer resides is to be considered
 a need for the consumer or not requires a judgment on whether a certain
 level of consumption is absolutely necessary for one's social reference
 group.
 We can neither assert the education from a certain elite school as a basic
 needs driven by biology, nor can we ignore the peer effects towards status
 consumption that are implied by the consumer preferring to choose an elite
 school.
 In the context of status consumption, it is thus necessary to consider
 the external needs of the consumer.In the model that we specify, these peer
 effects are defined by the external needs corresponding to the consumer's
 possessions which necessitate a certain maintenance/upkeep costs
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Evidently, status is not an internal need using our approach.
 Instead, it is constituted in the consumer's demand for excess and the
 level of durable goods ownership while her internal needs remain independent
 of her wealth .
 In other words, there are no high-class or low-class internal needs of
 the consumer, the difference between the status of a rich and that of a
 poor family through a disparate demand for excess (in education).

In summary, the basic-needs basket - whose cost 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 varies with observed prices in a given region - proxies the internal needs
 of the consumer while the cost of possessions 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 proxy the external needs that account for the social or spatial context
 of the consumer.
 In the basic needs basket, we use food and energy as the categories that
 encompass internal needs of the consumer and the cost of maintenance for
 assets 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 which encompasses the external needs of the consumer.
 The total cost of needs of a consumer are therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi+\Psi$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is measure of the basic needs of a consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 the observed cost of long-term assets and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 the cost of needs in a particular locality.
 All consumption that is neither part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 nor 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 counts towards consumer's excess relative to the asset-band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, a consumer obtains status through 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which determines 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

and the excess-relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 (which depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 ).
 Thus if the total expenditure on non-durable consumption is represented
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 the excess is related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu\psi P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})+\Psi+P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

.
 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 is the price of excess relevant in the respective reference

In a direct utility function that the consumer maximises to rank (compare)
 herself, the consumer must get some utility her wealth-band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
 This is necessary for there to be a point of indifference at which a consumer
 in a poor wealth band may trade places with another in a richer (higher)
 wealth band.
 It is only when both relative-social positioning and absolute possessions
 have utility for the consumer, when a rich consumer with low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 relative to a higher asset-band may trade places with someone in the poor
 neighborhood who has a higher (local) social-positioning.
 To illustrate this further, consider the consumers

\begin_inset Formula $R$

 who live in a poor and a rich region respectively so that their non-durable

 The cost of needs

 would evidently be lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P}<\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 and therefore the per-head excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 values are 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=\frac{c_{P}-\Psi_{P}}{\psi_{P}}$

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

 respectively.
 If we assume that

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 have the same basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{P}=\psi_{R}$
\end_inset

, a status comparison through excess alone would imply that there may never
 be any two values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}\sim\nu_{R}$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 could trade places with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

 as long as utility is a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 The utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

 a small pond - so to speak - to trade places with the small fish in a big

 The 
\series bold
empirical concerns related with the appropriate size of the asset band
\series default
 - which we use as reference level for status consumption are also discussed.
 It is worth pointing out how the visibility survey methods infer the reference
 levels for inferences related to status.
 Often this is accomplished with through direct questionnaires (see Heffetz
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) - thus building a reference through a visibility index of various commodities.
 While the visibility approach (see Ireland 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

, Hopkins-Kornienko 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) permits a separability of necessary items from conspicuous item, it also
 assumes status items to be futile in the regular sense (an argument attributed
 to Veblen).
 The assumption that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular
 sense allows the visible consumption to be treated separable (additively)
 from the non-visible consumption utility - permitting us in turn to lump
 together the demand for conspicuous items into one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commodity.
 The tractability of models based on the visibility approach however comes
 at a cost since the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption must only
 include items that are commonly understood to have exclusive signaling
 value (see Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a discussion of the criteria).
 In the nascent modern economies of sub-Saharan Africa, we find this definition
 to be somewhat limiting since the bandwagon items such as electronics or
 cars pose obvious empirical concerns are hardly futile but serve status
 needs in the environment of recent urbanisation in developing economies
 (see Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for criticism of rather belle epoque views of status consumption).
 Instead of the relying on the futility assumption therefore we prefer the
 notion of excess relative to one's asset-band
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 - where relevant wealth differences in an economy have a direct role to
 play.
 The formulation allows us to focus on how a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 towards status could be constrained due to extreme wealth differences.
 We believe that the model adds to a generic understanding of status consumption
 that is applicable to other developing economies.

Hierarchy of Consumer Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central claim that much of the model can be derived from is that status
 is a part of the consumer's long-term utility.
 If not, the representative consumer in the model would have no reason to
 engage in status-related consumption.
 As there is something to be gained from non-durable status-consumption
 towards status (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a consumer
 can achieve a higher status in the model by the acquisition of durable
 goods through excess non-durable consumption relative to her social reference.
 While the non-durable consumption does not improve her ranking in the wealth
 order immediately, it may enhance social interactions, improve the consumer's
 self-image and is possible to achieve with an income lower than what may
 be required to acquire long-term durable items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The excess (non-durable consumption in excess of needs) provides both felicity
 and status advantage to the consumer - since all else being the same, someone
 with a habit of a higher quality is likely to have more status than someone
 consuming a lower quality relative to her reference group.
 Status consumption fulfills both short-term and long-term goals of the
 consumer - the former being fulfilled with non-durable consumption and
 the later with ownership of durable goods.
 It is possible to view the social characteristics such as residence, neighborho
od or social class as cumulative long-term status items that are acquired
 over multiple generations.
 As long as one may assume that the rewards of status are passed on to the
 progeny, and social characteristics aligned with wealth differences, a
 social reference group relevant for status consumption can be viewed as
 a wealth band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this temporal hierarchy of needs, social and wealth-band identities could
 be seen as the most permanent of all possessions - while the ownership
 of durable goods is more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 The representative consumer, once having addressed her basic needs, therefore
 attempts to distribute her total (income) outlay into the three variables
 - needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and permanent ownership 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Consumers within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 The choice between

 Given such a substitution between

 we prefer a cost-function approach for two reasons.

 Second is the heterogeneity of excess prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 implied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 which are not addressed sufficiently with the direct utility approach above.
 This limitation could be severe because the costs of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 differ significantly across regions in a developing economy due to the
 disparities in urban and rural areas (owing to structural issues such as
 high transportation costs etc.) or the differences in the market for status
 goods across wealth levels 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

 is neither lexicographic but nor additive.
  We therefore look a more quantitative look at how

 it follows that a consumer may not compete for status using 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 if the differences in their asset-levels 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 are too wide apart.
 In other words, the excess competition only occurs within the neighborhood
 of a given

 As such a consumer in the band

 Still the two bands could be so wide - that a consumer does not compare

 Thus while unexpressed differences in wealth may be the very cause of status
 consumption, it is also true in our model that extremely wide wealth difference
s segregate participation in status competitions.
 This defines the context of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 both in the severely unequal societies of the developing economies and
 the urban settings where various social groups are bound together through
 economic developments.
 For as long as wealth matters towards status and the consumers of disparate
 wealth levels participate in a common status competition, one can be assured
 that the higher wealth differences would segregate the status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical observations also confirm that the status items are tied to specific
 wealth levels - e.g.
 better food and beverages tend to indicate status at low wealth levels,
 luxury accessories at medium wealth levels and exclusive possessions (expensive
 watches, private jet access) at higher levels of wealth.
 There is evidence to the observation that the consumers with varied wealth-leve
ls often compete predominantly with those in their proximity (see Chai et
 al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 Status competitions thrive because we are consciously averse to committing
 ourselves to the implications of a long-term wealth order.
 A psychological need to maintain a certain self-image and dismiss the role
 of known wealth differences to our near future necessitates the status
 consumption at varied wealth-levels.
 So while the differences in wealth drive the excess, it is also likely
 to be segregated based on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 To illustrate the implied structure of

 One can think of a critical difference in wealth

 Empirically, we evaluate the subsistence level in the context of sub-Saharan
 Africa using a basket of minimum food and energy requirements for an individual
 at the local market prices available in the survey.
 The exclusion of durable goods from subsistence and the view of excess
 as non-durable consumption in excess of one's needs together imply that
 the price of long-term durable goods cannot vary with

 This is because there is no sense of

 on excess we consider two consumers with the same outlay (total expenditure)

 (thus more assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

/ 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 mean more maintenance costs).
 Assuming also that the cost of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the same for the two consumers, the excess consumption for the urban
 and rural consumers would depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 how far apart the urban and rural wealth bands are.
 Thus an urban consumer who is poorer in absolute terms i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}<\Psi_{rural}$
\end_inset

 may enjoy a higher excess budget (
\begin_inset Formula $\because x-\Psi_{rural}-\delta<x-\Psi_{urban}-\delta$
\end_inset

) and a better position due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 (more rich residents reside in the urban area and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{urban}>\mathscr{A}_{rural}$
\end_inset

 ) but her excess relative to her band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{urban}$
\end_inset

 faces a different price from that of the rural consumer (who belongs to
 the band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{rural}$
\end_inset

) .
 Despite the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 therefore , the rural consumer's relative position in her respective band
 depends on the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{{A}}$
\end_inset

i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{rural})$

 and the overall position of the consumer is a combination of her relation
 position as well as the effect of

\end_inset

 (the trait of being urban).
 If the rural consumer also faces a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 than the urban consumer, excess would help the rural consumer feel to be
 of the same status as that of the urban consumer.
 Similarly, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}>\Psi_{rural}$
\end_inset

 the excess budget of the rural consumer is higher (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}>\Psi_{rural}\Rightarrow x-\Psi_{urban}-\delta<x-\Psi_{rural}-\delta$
\end_inset

.
 The status of urban and rural consumers would be far apart unless the rural
 consumer has a lower cost 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 than the urban consumer.

 A substitution is thus possible between two bands

 only if

 a consumer is much further to her peers in the band

 than she would be in

 The goal of our econometric analysis is thus to find to what extent such

We can therefore assess the extent to which the status competitions through

 The Equation

 shows that extreme differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 or
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 could all result in weakening of competitions (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

).
 Revisiting the previous example of the urban and rural consumers, consider
 the two consumers in successive bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 who both have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 .
 Extreme differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 evidently segments the status goods across 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

) and allows the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 to dominate the comparisons between consumers from band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
 A segregation can similarly be caused also by 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 differences - which directly influence the excess consumption.
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 does not change for two consumers having the same total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the successive bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\mathscr{A}}=\Psi_{\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}}=\Psi$
\end_inset

, consider how a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})>P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 allows competititons with excess separation due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})}<\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})}$
\end_inset

 (the indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})},\mathscr{A})=u(\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})},\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 is made possible for the two consumers).
 The two consumers could thus exchange places with each other if 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})>P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

.
 If one finds a substitution in the successive bands empirically i.e.
 consumers reducing the excesses (facing the same

 is weak.
 Similarly when

 , we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})}>\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})}$
\end_inset

 and a segregation of excess

 would be observed due to lack of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{{A}}$
\end_inset

 substitution i.e.
 consumers would increase excess as they move to the higher band.
 On similar lines, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 in certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 to adjust their status consumption i.e.
 excess and newer durable goods purchases based on their particular position

The other less straightforward option - which does not require the consumer

\end_layout

\end_inset

 we rewrite the consumer budget as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
x_{t} & \equiv\Delta_{t}+c_{t}-\Psi-P_{\psi}\psi_{t}=\Delta_{t}+P_{\nu}\psi_{t}\nu_{t}\label{eq:x_t_definition}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subsistence costs therefore correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 (a zero outlay means the subsistence level expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Delta_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 due to our assumption of subsistence level not requiring any long-term
 possessions).
 A higher budget in the specification could be thus either spent on excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu\psi$
\end_inset

 or more long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 As the consumer acquires more durable goods her outlay could fall if the
 costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 rise.
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 by assumption and that the life-cycle effects are already part of the model
 since the effective outlay for excess decreases with increases in needs
 (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

).
 Two important claims are implied by the formulation that would our discussion

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Claim

\shape italic
Higher subsistence costs would suppress consumption on excess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a straightforward implication given the definition of the outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Higher subsistence prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 have the same effect as that of reducing the disposable outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 (relevant for excess) .
 It is implied also that of the two consumer wealth bands facing different
 subsistence costs, the band having the higher subsistence costs would have
 lower outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards status consumption.
 For a consumer closer to the subsistence level, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 would be low and a rise in subsistence costs would mean a minimal outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, a consumer further from subsistence i.e.
 with an outlay higher than subsistence level may substitute between owning
 more durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 more comfortably.
 The rise in subsistence prices for such a consumer lowers her budget for
 excess but not as much compared to a consumer who survives closer to subsistenc
e levels.
 That lowering the outlay at higher levels of the outlay does not drop the
 bliss (utility) as sharply as closer to the subsistence is evident from
 the shape of the PIGLOG curve as well (see Appendix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Claim

\shape italic
Status competitions are spurred as subsistence becomes cheaper and bliss
 becomes expensive in the PIGLOG formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of this claim is proven trivially.
 Subsistence becoming cheaper makes sure that more consumers participate
 in the status consumption.
 With the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we can see that rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
reduce the outlay for excess as well as permanent goods and thus discourage
 status competition.
 To explain how price-rises in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) could affect the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) for the second part, recall that the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is only with respect to a certain wealth band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is subject to the demand from consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 , the consumers within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 competing with excess would drive the price for excess
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

.
 Since the demand for status goods is limited to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 the substitution between permanent-ownership and excess would not be as
 if every consumer had a fixed demand for  excess which she adjusts as the
 price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rise and fall.
 Instead, when 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is driven by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

, a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may create more competition for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods leading to a rise in the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 The rise of prices of assets for consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 thus raises the price of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 On other other hand, too much of a drop in prices of assets could mark
 a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 .
 This is because if the rise in prices of assets is so much that a redistributio
n of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (wealth) ensues i.e.
 the consumers may sell their 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and move to the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, then the significant rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could lower the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 goods.
 Equivalently, when there is a small drop in price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, more consumers within the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band would stock 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 would fall.
 Again, the fall in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could be so much that there would be a lot many consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band and the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods would rise.
 This dynamics exists because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is specific to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and prices of assets as well as excess are associated with status competitions
 (see Bilancini et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BILANCINIStatusRanking2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for similar arguments).
 The substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 due to price is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lumpy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a sense so that it occurs only for big changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and is irrelevant for small changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The positional demand dominates the price dynamics for small changes in
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
To consider the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 as the price for excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 changes, now consider how a rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 through introduction of new quality goods (newer technology, products etc.)
 could affect the prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The price of excess increases the status of only a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band and as a newer item is introduced, all other items may not have as
 much value towards status any more.
 The newly introduced item - which has a higher price - would thus slightly
 raise the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 .
 If the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands are intact, the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 should drop as 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rises due to a new item.
 Since excess is always tied to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, a more significant rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 through introduction of new items would make it worthwhile to downgrade
 or upgrade one's 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and enjoy a less intense 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in another 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band .
 The association of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 implies that the changes in price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 may never cause a redistribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the help of above dynamics we can now explain how bliss becoming more
 expensive through rise of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 amounts to the intensification of status competitions.
 Specifically, as small rises of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 move together, a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for consumer above subsistence does little to end the need for status competiti
ons as long as wealth or asset hierarchies stay the same.
 Without changes that transform the asset hierarchies, we can argue that
 bliss becoming more expensive amounts to more intense status competition.

Empirical Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A limitation of the excess approach we have adopted is that it does not
 differentiate an excess in food items from an excess in clothes.
 While in an itemwise analysis one considers the elasticities of status
 goods explicitly, excess treats a rural overspending on a traditional wedding
 ceremony the same as the urban spending on cable TV subscriptions.
 The excess approach is favoured nevertheless since it solves two key measuremen
t error issues for us.
 First is the lack of observed prices for categories such as clothing or
 entertainment in the survey data.
 Due to severe measurement errors in measure elasticities caused by using
 unit prices (i.e.
 average expenditure on clothing in lieu of clothing prices in the estimation)
 we limit ourselves to testing if excesses are separated across levels of
 asset-ownership hierarchies or not with the excess approach (see Gibson
 et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for measurement errors with unit prices).
 The second issue is the mixing of daily-diary and monthly diary which also
 is noted to result in measurement errors in calibration of item elasticities
 (see Deaton-Dreze 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who note this problem and use the ownership levels of the various durable
 goods as a proxy for living standards to get around measurement error problems).
 The excess approach avoids this issues by separating the needs from quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A concern can also be raised due to our of use of food and energy needs
 as the base level to determine excess.
 Against the notion of excess, one could argue that the needs vary significantly
 within an economy.
 For example, urban expenditures - such as transportation and entertainment
 - are needs in an urban area but not in a rural area.
 The specified model only handles such perceived differences in needs with
 either

e.g.
 with transportation ), the urban consumer - who has the same total expenditure
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as the rural consumer - has a less excess outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})\times\nu$
\end_inset

 due to higher transportation expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Psi)$
\end_inset

.
 The urban consumer with a lower excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 therefore is set to balance the utility from the trait of being urban (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{urban}$
\end_inset

) with having less excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 than the rural consumer.
 This is possible since the consumer uses both 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 to compare status.
 When the urban expenditure are a part of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})\times\nu$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 with entertainment which is always considered part of excess), a comparison
 of excess accompanies with comparison of asset ownership for status comparisons.
 Since the urban areas are always richer on the whole than rural areas,
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})$
\end_inset

 is necessarily different from 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{rural})$
\end_inset

 and the higher excess for the urban consumer availing more entertainment
 is always viewed in relation to the asset hierarchy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 which the urban and rural consumer belong to.
 The differences in urban and rural needs are thus interpreted in the model
 as differences in wealth band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our reluctance towards using a definition of needs driven by social context
 is for two reasons - first is that there are no universal set of needs
 other than basic needs that we can agree upon.
 A rich person's needs must always appear futile to the poorer individual
 and therefore a certain bias is inherent in the classification of status-items.
 The identification of subjective necessities for a consumer can itself
 be a task open to subjectivity.
 The second reason is the limitation implied by the empirical data.
 While it is true that an urban consumer having the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as the rural consumer may “feel” that her entertainment needs are higher
 due to peer effects, it is not consumption data itself that tells us whether
 the consumers move to urban areas to achieve a higher status or that the
 residents of the urban areas feel more pressures which represent a higher
 entertainment need (this is the same issue that one finds in the empirical
 identification of habit and quality in the demand literature).
 We prefer to not make either of such assertions and represent lifestyle
 differences in the rural area and the urban area - for example - only through
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

-dependent excess prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of arguing that certain needs are more important in the urban area,
 we argue only that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 in the urban area is different and could create a segregation in status
 items from the rural area.
 In other words, the status competitions in the urban area may become independen
t of the status competitions in the rural area and lead most rural consumers
 to have either a higher status than the urban consumers (or vice versa).
 Any other fixed-effects in excess budget can easily removed in the analysis
 as well.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the conditions for segregation of status competitions is driven by how
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

 and

 vary in an economy.
 If one were to elicit a function

 Stronger dependence of excesses on

 Therefore if there is no separation across identified bands 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $u(\nu,A)=u(\nu',A')$

 for the same

\end_inset

 In terms of the cost-function approach, the consumers in bands

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 paying the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,P_{\nu}(A))$
\end_inset

 could be said to face different prices in the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

We use two metrics to represent the local and national level of hierarchies
 the dependence of status consumption on which is of particular interest
 to us:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The local hierarchy is represented with a 
\series bold
local relative-position 
\series default
(
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

) score - which is the ratio of wealth of the higher band to that of the
 consumer.
 We infer the logarithm wealth of the higher band for a consumer as 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{th}$
\end_inset

 quantile of the logarithm of assets-value (AV) in the local area (determined
 with region and district) where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 higher than the consumer's own logarithm AV rank.
 Thus with 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.1$
\end_inset

 in a group of 100 consumers in a given area, a higher-band wealth for a
 consumer with 20% percentile local rank in log-AV would be the 30% quantile
 wealth in the area.
 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 score serves as a local relative assert poverty metric - a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 means that the consumer is poorer relative to the richer neighbour.
 Being rich in a predominantly rich area would result in a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 for a consumer than being poor in a rich neighbourhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\series bold
sectorial-position 
\series default
(
\begin_inset Formula $SP$
\end_inset

) metric looks at the same metric at the top-level i.e.
 across all consumers in the economy.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $SP$
\end_inset

 metric is meant to represent the consumer's position in the national wealth
 hierarhcy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
We use the above metrics to comment on whether the local peer effects are
 more important to the consumer than the wider-level wealth differences
 or not.
 More specifically, a comparison of the dependence of excesses on local
 asset-difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 vs national asset-differences 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 helps us comment whether the differences at local
\bar default
 levels may be more important to the consumer than at national levels.
 If excesses depends weakly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 but strongly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

, status competitions are limited to the local region and the region is
 relatively separated from other regions.
 Local peer effects 
\bar under
can be said to 
\bar default
dominate the differences in wealth at higher levels when excesses depend
 weakly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 but strongly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 (this could happen either if the consumer  resides in a relatively rich
 region or in a relatively poor region).
 On the other hand, if we find a weak significance on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 but a stronger dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

, then local separation exists and the rich consumer may be competing at
 a wider (national) level.
 It is indeed also possible that there is weak significance across both
 hierarchies (implying that excesses are not particularly separated at either
 levels) or that there is strong dependence across both hierarchies (the
 consumers have their excesses within the limits the position in the local
 hierarchies and are then also separated by regional wealth at the wider
 level).
 The empirical results from the Tanzanian have been interpreted using these
 arguments.

Cost of Needs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each wave of the survey, we use both the consumption diary of food items
 and the recall diary of non-food items to compute the cost of needs of
 the consumer - summing up the expenditure on the items that are considered
 necessities.
 The necessities are gathered from the four categories of consumption identified
 in the LSMS data - food, household, energy and transport.
 The cost of basic needs is therefore simply the cost of minimal requirements
 in every category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this interpretation of basic (internal) needs, we rely on the market-prices
 available in the survey for each locality.
 For example, under food category, we obtain the minimum requires for carbohydra
tes, fat, protein and fruits-vegetables categories and the prices of the
 cheapest item in each sub-category of food.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - is calculated at the level using the prices of the
 items recorded in the survey (the prices are recorded at the district level
 as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket is a diet of
 cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - these being the cheapest items
 in most regions.
 The cost of the basket thus calculated is much higher in the urban areas
 than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 This cost of baskset is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the basic cost of needs per household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LamSmith2012Kerosene"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and https://energypedia.info/ for data on typical energy usage in the developing
 countries).
 For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 Under transport category, the public-transport costs and petrol consumption
 costs (which in turn depend on whether a consumer owns a motor-bike or
 a car) are considered not as part of basic needs but as part of the costs
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-level including the means of transport (see Table

\begin_layout Subsection

Excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In empirical terms, excess is a measure of how far in value the consumption
 is from the local cost of reference level needs.
 For food commodities, standardising a set of needs general across the populatio
n is relatively easy - as the cost of needs in food would simply be the
 cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area for the total number
 of households in the family.
 But when the context of consumption is not limited to food and employment,
 the ideas of health and autonomy (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and Doyal-Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) require some justification based on the consumer's environment.
 In the particular context of Tanzania, the differences between urban or
 rural settings drive our consideration of subsistence costs 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

.
 The measurement error for the cost of internal needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 of the household - i.e.
 the product of the number of units in the family and observed price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 - is minimal due to the availability of market prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 at the district level in the survey and the detailed record of the members
 of the households (including their cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - which we use to measure the needs of the household).
 Notice that we observe excess not at the level of the individual but at
 the level of a group of individuals with characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (which could also be associated with an 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that all costs incurred due to maintenance, usage and upkeep of the
 long-term durable goods are included in the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and would thus bear a higher non-durable
 consumption level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical goods would not have
 the same non-durable consumption).
 Revisiting the earlier example, consider a consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 with a refrigerator and another consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 without a refrigerator who both have the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and the same set of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 .
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{E_{L}}<\Psi_{E_{H}}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{E_{L}}>c_{t}-\Psi_{E_{H}}$
\end_inset

) .
 But does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 While the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity groups
 (over energy or durable goods for example).
 Strictly speaking, the quality in one commodity can be hardly substituted
 with the quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality can be meaningful in the setting only as long
 as a total cost of basic needs level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is considered.
 The notion of excess - subject to such a level - is a way to assess overall
 quality in non-durable consumption.
 If having a refrigerator is not considered a basic need, we can say nothing
 more for a comparison of quality than that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

.

), a particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey ranges from short-term
 durable items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets
 such as land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 Our classification of long-term durable goods is based on intergenerational
 transfers - so an item is included in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and thus its cost of maintenance are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) only if it can be passed on through generations
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An empirical criterion for consideration of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is also that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 should increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (there are no assets that can be maintained without any costs).
 This avoids an assets-interpretation of certain social characteristics
 such as education or club-membership - which may be acquired over a life-time,
 require some investment (fees for education or club membership) and even
 have a definite value in the market (e.g.
 employment market).
 Such personal characteristics (e.g.
 education) are not considered as assets simply because they don't carry
 any maintenance costs.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The details of records include the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 the household expects by selling the durable good in the market at the
 time of the survey.
 We refer to the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$

 that the household expects by selling the durable good in the market as
 marked-to-market average or simply mtm average in the foregoing discussion.

[WE IGNORE SPLIT HOUSEHOLDS]

\begin_layout Standard
We find that as a recall value, the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 is particularly sensitive to measurement errors.
 Recorded by the survey at two different time-points spread across two years
 (let's call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs can change over the period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) may be significantly different from the cost reported in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 This could simply be because of a different member of the same household
 providing the estimate in the two different years.
 The problem could also get worsened due to two further issues - first the
 waves are not a panel-data set in the true sense - the household visited
 in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is likely to have been visited in the year

 Second - a significant number of households are split in multiple households
 - thus permitting more measurement errors as the new household members
 recall the cost of owned items.

Due to above issues with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

, we use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods (i.e.
 the mtm average) as it is not recalled from consumer's memory but instead
 reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time - an
 issue can be handled by averaging over 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets is achieved by multiplying th number of assets
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Around 10% of the households that were split in the periods 2010-2012 and
 in 2012-2014 have been ignored for our analyses.

 The budget 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is used as the dependent variable in a fixed effects estimation where disposabl
e income 
\begin_inset Formula $log(c_{t}-\Psi_{t}-P_{\psi}\psi+\Delta_{t}$
\end_inset

) (variable 
\family typewriter

) is used as one of control variables.
 The budget ratios 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\Delta A}$
\end_inset

 are defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
w_{\nu}=\frac{\nu_{t}\psi_{t}P_{\nu,t}}{\nu_{t}\psi_{t}P_{\nu,t}+\Delta A_{t}}=\frac{c_{t}-\Psi_{t}-P_{\psi}\psi}{c_{t}-\Psi_{t}-P_{\psi}\psi+\Delta A_{t}}\label{eq:BudgetMeasure_nu}\\
w_{\Delta A}=\frac{\Delta A_{t}}{\nu_{t}\psi_{t}P_{\nu,t}+\Delta A_{t}}=\frac{\Delta A_{t}}{c_{t}-\Psi_{t}-P_{\psi}\psi+\Delta A_{t}}\label{eq:BudgetMeasure_A}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We interpret
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 as the demand for excess while 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the price associated with a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
 Apart from the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

, the price of needs is also used as a control variable for the excess budget
 ratio - since a higher cost of needs could also cause the consumer to save
 more (due to the intertemporal setting)

If not for the market observed prices, this would introduce a serious measuremen

To establish that observing budget ratio
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is an measure for excess as appropriate as the amount spent towards excess
 - which the consumers compete with - let’s consider three consumers who
 are rich (with assets valued at 4,000,000), middle-income (assets valued
 at 900,000) and poor (assets valued at 10,000).
 If the maintenance costs was simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A}$
\end_inset

 (for the value of asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) we observe basic needs costs and total expenses, the excess can be calculated
 as shown in the tables

 The consumer spending more on assets in Table

 as a lower expenditure on excess and thus a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Consider now that if the rich in the example has both a higher excess and
 higher asset value then there the separation condition applies and there
 can be no competition among the consumers.
 This is the state of the status competition in the Table

 we have less separation - as is the case in Table

[Robustness Subjective Well-being] To test the robustness of our measure
 of excess, we use the subjective well-being data from the survey.
 If excesses are used to offset existing wealth hierarchies, we should find
 that those who are not satisfied with their financial status would have
 higher excess.
 Our finding is that after accounting for wealth levels (durable goods ownership
) those who are satisfied have less recorded excess.
 That said, we cannot use this data to conclude whether a consumer has higher
 excess due to not having a any options to purchase long-term assets or
 due to extreme peer pressures in her asset-band.
 What we can ascertain however is that for the same total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, those with less assets consistently feel dissatisfied and have higher
 excess levels.
 The exception are the indeed the extremely unsatisfied consumers who are
 also often extremely poor and have low excess.
 Similarly extremely satisfied consumers in the higher asset band also have
 less excess.
 Here, too one must not rely on how excess is being spent the different

 The BW score similarly explains if the separation may apply to the entire
 region (district) the consumer is a part of.
 Assuming the same distribution of assets, an economically poorer regions
 might see a different pattern for excess consumption than the rich region.

[Conclusions] If excess is lower for out-of-place consumers (with asset
 differences in the neighborhood) then there is separation.
 We find no evidence of that.
 Being in a rich area suppresses w_nu and being out of place has a positive
 effect.
 The separation is therefore limited in urban areas - more out of place
 consumers (who are more encouraged to stay within there own level) have
 a strong positive economic significance on w_nu.
 Here it is worth noting that when extremely unequal communtiies are being
 compared – the opportunities of quality would be extremely limited.
 So individual care more about their local circumstances because they really
 can’t care about quality.
 If I live in a neighborhood where the asset-neighbors are richer in compared
 to asset-neighbours in the entire country, excess is actually lower.
 It can’t be because quality is lower in the richer areas – it must be because
 demand for quality is less and individuals are spending more on assets
 – that are available in the relative rich areas (this is sensitive to how
 assets are classified).
 The main observatioin is that despite not as high A, we see higher Psi
 in the middle-A individuals – likely among urban individuals.
 Putting both together, the out of place is actually more dominant – meaning
 that competing with the rich the dominant trend – solely because of how
 the economy is structured.
 We also test with the additional metric of individual who are aware of
 the same language (we look at the ratio of people who speak English in
 the band to the total number of people in the band – this effects needs
 to be taken together with others control variables) – but social differences
 based on language do not seem significant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An issue that may be raised with the above conclusions is that the basic
 needs of the consumer may not be reliably determined with the price of
 a needs basket alone.
 To detail this issue further, consider an example where we have expenditure
 data on phones for a 1000 families and we know that the 200 of the 100
 consumers are rich, 400 are middle-income and 400 are poor.
 Assume that we also have the data on age and composition of the families.
 If we observe that some of them have much higher monthly expenditure on
 phones than others, then choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

basic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 expenditure on phone as the fees for landline, we may declare all expense
 higher than the landline costs as the excess.
 An issue could be raised by arguing that the individual’s needs are not
 down to landline costs – as a consumer might have more family members living
 away, she may be conducting occupational calls using her phone, have her
 partner living far away from her or she may be might just too talkative.
 Such effects however are always either observed in data (such as the number
 of family members, the regional effects etc.) or can be removed with differencin
g observations spread over time (e.g.
 with a fixed effects estimation).
 That is the reason why prices being observed locally is key to our analysis
 of excess.
 The notion of excess only makes sense at the level of district since the
 market-observed prices are local prices.
 National level prices cannot be used to calculate excess at local levels.
 As long as we can assume as that landline is indeed the basic expense,
 we know how the excess varies in the population without a knowledge of
 the prices of every expensive phone variety.
 It can also be said whether separation exists or not in the population
 of 1000 families, by observing if the excess could is aligned with the
 observed A-band (i.e.
 if the consumers in the poorer band P have consistently a different excess
 from those in the richer band R).
 The analysis is equivalent to the one where expenditure on particular types
 of phones is available in the survey.

WHAT DOES THAT TELL ME ABOUT STATUS CONSUMPTION IN TANZANIA? Are we talking
 about separation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, the differences in urban and rural lifestyles play a major
 role in the difference in durable good purchases as well as excess.
 This is in particular due to the availability of electricity being limited
 to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for - thus are more likely
 to deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption in an environment of uneven prices for excess consumption.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived upside risk in future wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the consumers competing with those with higher
 wealth than themselves.
 Extreme wealth differences mean a crystallisation of socio-economic differences
 and an evident separation of quality and visible consumption.

[SEPARATION THERE OR NOT THAT IS THE QUESTION]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in wealth and the segregation of quality of life in the
 developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they may be in the
 segregated societies in developed economies).
 Therefore there is a need to be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries - if the distribution of durable
 goods in the economy have not been considered.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, it cannot be denied that visible consumption is of importance
 in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption and is worth exploring in its own right - but the
 considerations of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership are
 also appropriate not only in the context of marriages but in a generalised
 context of status consumption across economies.
 Marriages - like much of visible consumption - are both an indication of
 one's social status as well as a potential for advancement in social ranking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rural and urban differences in the developing world also fit into the
 model for permanent ownership and excess that we have used in the empirical
 analyses.
 The differences in wealths and consumer's futility of status consumption
 in presence of wide differences allow us to understand how status competitions
 could work under severe inequalities.
 Standardising demand in the market for status using the model may thus
 help us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across various economies.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost-function formulation shows just how restrictive a loglinear direct
 utility function really is.
 The above direct utility form of the loglinear utility claims that the
 price derivatives of cost-functions (which are typically equated with the
 budget ratio in the econometric analysis i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial p_{i}}$
\end_inset

) are the same for both subsistence and bliss sub-utilities.
 This is a strong assumption if one were to consider status utility using
 the loglinear formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus for the consumer choice between consuming value 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 (which the consumer avails in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) and increasing asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, a general PIGLOG cost-function would allow the sensitivity of savings
 rate (choice between consuming in the current period vs saving for future)
 with respect to prices of excess and durable goods to be different at subsisten
ce and bliss levels.
 The cost-function can still be used to describe the dynamics of the model
 just equally well.
 Much the way a direct utility function under a budget constraint explains
 that a higher price makes it difficult to obtain the same utility (comprising
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{q}=\{q_{i}\}$
\end_inset

), the cost-function approach shows how a higher price causes a consumer
 to avail less utility for the same cost (
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

).
