\begin_layout Title
Status consumption under wealth inequalities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
While status consumption is assumed to be ubiquitous, the possibility that
 extreme wealth inequalities in an economy could discourage status consumption
 has been explored less often.
 Using the context of a developing economy, we use a model that views status
 consumption as non-durable consumption in excess of the consumer needs
 relative to her wealth band and explore the opposing effects of peer influences
 and extreme wealth differences.
 Using consumption microdata from the Tanzanian LSMS survey for years 2010,
 2012 and 2014, we discuss how a segregation of status competitions based
 on extreme wealth differences and heterogeneity of available commodities
 could characterise status consumption in a developing economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical studies in both developed and developing economies have associated
 social segmentation in an economy with disproportionate spending on conspicuous
 items

.
 While such disparities are often explained with social-reference groups,
 the ways in which status consumption differ under the environment of extreme
 poverty in developing countries has been explored less often.
 Noting the prevalent wealth inequalities, we reexamine the notion of status
 in developing economies with a particular focus on the opposing direction
 of peer effects and the effects of wealth differences on status consumption.
 On one hand, status consumption is enhanced with peer effects but on the
 other, it would be discouraged under extreme wealth differences which the
 poorer consumer may not overcome.
 The relevance of pecuniary emulation - i.e.
 the notion that the habits of the rich are emulated by the poorer consumers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 - must therefore be considered warily as extreme wealth differences may
 have the effect of making status consumption appear futile to the poor
 consumers.
 Seeking conditions under which the demand for status goods is reduced in
 spatially or economically separated reference groups

\end_layout

\end_inset

 we use a model for status consumption that views status in a context of
 wide wealth-band differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Treating wealth bands as relevant reference points in the empirical data,
 we argue that a consumer both compares herself with reference consumption
 of other groups which she doesn't belong and to those within her own group.
 Status consumption is relevant only to relative to a particular wealth
 band the consumers belongs to.
 This view of status consumption derives from a certain social-deference
 perspective for status that has been embraced in many economic studies
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Status consumption from such a perspective is an attempt to offset the
 effects of existing wealth hierarchies towards status.
 Any two consumers in the model compete with each other for status using
 both the permanent ownership of items and the excess non-durable consumption
 (i.e.
 consumption above the cost of needs).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of our empirical analysis is to understand the relative importance
 of differences in wealth at local levels to the wealth band differences
 observed at higher (national) levels.
 The empirical measurement of the permanent ownership of items uses the
 long term durable goods data available for every household in the survey.
 The excess non-durable consumption - which is defined with respect to a
 particular asset band (assessed with permanent ownership data) - is measured
 as excess over the cost of needs.
 The cost of needs used for excess in turn comprises of the cost of basic
 needs varying across regions and the cost of owning long-term goods that
 define the asset-band (costs associated with maintenance of long-term durable
 goods are also available in the survey).
 After adjusting for her needs, a consumer is meant to optimise the utility
 she obtains from both excess and long-term possessions.
 Social or spatial characteristics matter to the consumer in the model through
 both the durable goods cluster which the consumer belongs to and the price
 of needs that the consumer is exposed to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In popular culture, status consumption often evokes images of wasteful expenditu
re and exclusive possessions that provide no economic value other than an
 attraction to people of equal affluence.
 We find this view rather inadequate for the utility provided by status
 consumption - which we believe is necessarily tied with social ranking.
 The view of status consumption as a waste presents an obvious issue with
 deciding whether a consumer's newly acquired wealth - whether it be jewelry
 of acquisition of undervalued land or property - is to be considered a
 part of her high-status necessities or wasteful conspicuous consumption.
 Since we have no way of knowing the intentions of consumers by evaluating
 their consumption diaries, we focus only on a comparison of consumption
 in excess of needs for a given set of measurements for existing  wealth
 and consumer's necessities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This notion of excess excludes both the basic needs of the consumer as well
 as any maintenance costs for the long-term possession the role of which
 towards status is considered explicitly.
 Thus if one owns a car, the petrol used up for driving is not an excess
 and contributes only to the cost of bearing assets.
 As consumers are meant to use both excess and long-term ownership for status
 competitions and since excess varies according to a particular asset-cluster
 (band) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 one belongs, the idiosyncratic habits average out for the notion of excess
 with respect to a wealth band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
 This is admissible since the empirical claim that we wish to test is whether
 non-durable status consumption - viewed as excess over needs - is dominated
 by status competition in the local wealth hierarchy or those among the
 consumers of similar wealth in a spatial proximity.
 The significance of the metrics related to wealth at local and national
 levels help us comment if local peer effects are more important for the
 consumer than the differences in wealth observed at a higher level in the
 wider economy.
 This perspective towards non-durable status consumption may be more relevant
 to how status motivations influence urban migration or demand for industrial
 items than the analysis of visible items in the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key appeal of the above approach is that unlike with the studies in
 visible consumption, one need not rely on the assumption that status goods
 are futile.
 While the futility assumption implicitly ensures the separability of demand
 for visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004,ireland_signals"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in an empirical analysis, it neither encompasses status consumption fully
 nor does it satisfy a desired criterion for visibility in bandwagon items
 such as electronics or cars that have clear utility in the regular sense
 apart from providing relative status advantage.
 The futility assumption may thus be inadequate for the representation of
 status consumption in a developing economy where both wealth differences
 and disparate economic conditions have a more conspicuous role to play.
 The notion of status using the permanent ownership and a more general notion
 of quality (which includes any high-price non-durable consumption) allows
 us to move beyond proxies of cultural contexts (e.g.
 using visibility surveys
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility,ZahraIndia"

 etc.) or a focus on historically restricted goods (e.g.
 ownership barriers for African American sub-population in the U.S., racial
 segregation in South Africa or religion-caste barriers in India

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen seems interested in the psychologica

 At times his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen does not dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 The symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assisted with the developments in game theory and an improvement in the
 quality of microdata from consumption surveys, an interest in Veblen's
 observations has been revived in the recent decades (see Frank

 and Koustobinas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 This recent attention to status consumption need not to be viewed asunder
 from the consumer demand literature on habit-formation (see for example
 Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for the classical treatment of quality and cost-of-living indices).
 One could extend the notion of quality in consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to view status consumption within the framework of consumed demand - as
 long as a suitable relation between consumption and status can be established.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of status most commonly used in literature - where it is seen
 as a static long-term characteristics of the consumer - however presents
 an obvious paradox with respect to consumption since there cannot be any
 utility from status-consumption if status were only accumulated over a
 long-term.
 The admission that status is subject to change with consumption - just
 the way it is shaped by income or education - trivially resolves the paradox
 (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 where status - like in many studies in sociology and health sciences -
 is used as a vector education or income ).
 We therefore use a dynamic view of status provided by Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that has been widely embraced in the economic studies.
 The dynamic approach views status as a wealth-based ranking order that
 can be altered by the consumer with consumption.
 Thus a consumer achieves status utility through consumption with the hope
 and display of moving upwards in a ranking order that is otherwise determined
 by wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider wealth bands the immediate reference group of the consumer where
 status consumption is observed.
 The context of wealth differences in status consumption has been explored
 less often in the literature on status consumption (except for some studies
 that explore the effect of income inequality on conspicuous consumption
 e.g.

).
 The wealth-band based approach differs from the studies on visible consumption
 that explore the role of social identities in status consumption (see Chao
 et al.

]).
 Particularly in the context of a developing country, we argue that the
 status-indicating goods need not be the same as those that are considered
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed economies.
 Instead the wealth differences - the necessary context of status consumption
 - may be far too wide for the limited visible items in the developing economies
 to matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the ranking of social characteristics is often a result of long-term
 asset inequalities, the role played by social identities towards status
 can also be viewed as part of wealth band hierarchy (see Timothy

\end_inset

, Bilancini et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BILANCINIStatusRanking2012"

\end_inset

).
 However, such a treatment of social identities as wealth bands requires
 an empirical validation of the alignment of social identity difference
 with wealth inequalities.
 This is because the reference groups defined by social identities tend
 to limit the status consumption within themselves (see Chai et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 If aligned, the relevance of social characteristics for status consumption
 could also be understood in terms of the respective wealth bands that the
 consumers are a part of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a given wealth band a consumer belongs to, status consumption consists
 of the consumer's long-term durable goods purchases and the excess non-durable
 consumption relative to her wealth band.
 The wealth bands are defined using the
\shape italic
 long-term possessions
\shape default
 of the consumer (the stock of durable goods possessed by consumer - inclusive
 of housing, land and other long-term assets) while the 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
non-durable consumption which help the perception of higher status is simply
 consumption in excess of needs in the wealth band.
 Evidently the fulfillment of basic needs itself does not offer an advantage
 to the consumer in a status competition - and a consumer with a habit of
 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) measured as excess would have a higher status than another consumer
 with same needs who consumes less quality (excess).
 It follows that any status utility to be derived from non-durable consumption
 is constituted in the felicity from excess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use the costs associated with the durable goods and consumption in excess
 of a minimum necessary consumption to arrive at the empirical measurement
 of excess.
 The costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of durable goods are
 easy to obtain as they are often available as part of the consumer diary.
 Similarly, the variation in the cost of a standard basket of basic needs
 across the regions and districts is often available with the market prices
 in a survey.
 Therefore, as long as the basic needs of the consumer and the possession
 of the long-term durable goods can be determined in an economy, the

excess

can be readily estimated for the wealth band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

\end_layout

A necessary requirement of this needs-based approach is that the empirical
 measurement of excess relies on the notion of what is

 for the consumer (at least as much as it is for the very definition of

 The very idea of basic needs can be controversial when on one hand, we
 have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective preferences
 (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, a commonly-understood set of needs could supersede
 a consumer's subjective wants.
 To fix a particular definition of needs the analyses, we rely on both internal
 needs and external needs and lean towards an objective middle-path proposed
 by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy - in addition to health - as basic needs of the consumer.
 The needs of the consumer can thus be fixed without shunning the idea that
 the needs should vary across cultural contexts.
 We view basic (internal) needs of the consumer are requirements not meeting
 which would lead to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory
 argued for by Doyal and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Such basic needs are easy to identify in the consumer dairy and are distinguish
ed from the costs (maintenance, fees etc.) associated with durable goods
 possessed by the consumer.
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite.
 A starch diet fulfilling the set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

basic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dietary needs can thus be ruled out.
 The role of basic needs in our empirical analysis designate the requirements
 the internal needs are common across all consumers regardless of their
 social context.
 The price of such basic needs is then calculated based on the market observed
 prices available in the survey.
 The costs associated with upkeep and maintenance of owned permanent assets
 are obtained directly from the survey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external needs of the consumer are included in the latter set of costs
 of associated with owned permanent goods.
 While the internal needs can be determined with the biological needs of
 the household alone (represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - the number of household-members, number of children, individual age,
 body weight etc.), the latter also encompasses what the consumer feels important
 due to her wealth band.
 As an example, consider the needs of lodging/home-ownership or the primary
 education of children in the area where a consumer resides.
 The costs incurred by living a particular area consists of costs that are
 associated with owned goods and costs that aren't.
 In terms of our model, it is only the former costs for assets - as well
 as from the costs of basic internal needs - that is absolutely necessary
 for one's social reference group.
 Thus we can say that the peer effects influence the consumer's choice of
 excess relative to asset-band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset


\series bold

and that the external needs of the consumer's reference group comprise both
 of costs associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and the excess
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Status is not an internal need using the excess approach and is constituted
 in the consumer's demand for excess as well as the level of durable goods
 ownership while her internal needs remain independent of her wealth .
 In other words, there are no high-class or low-class internal needs of
 the consumer, the difference between the status of a rich and that of a
 poor family through a disparate demand for excess (in education).

 The total cost of needs of a consumer are therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi+\Psi$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is measure of the basic needs of a consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 the observed cost of long-term assets and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 the cost of basic (internal) needs in a particular locality.
 All consumption that is neither part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 nor 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 counts towards consumer's excess relative to the asset-band  
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, a consumer obtains status through 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which determines 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

and the excess-relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 (which depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 ).
 Thus if the total expenditure on non-durable consumption is represented
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 , the excess is related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu\psi P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})+\Psi+P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 While it is possible to explain the variation in

\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

\end_inset

 after eliminating the minimum costs of common internal needs of the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 to the consumer's status is worth reiterating in a formulation of a direct
 utility function.
 In other words, the consumer must get a utility from her wealth-band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 apart from excess in consumption.
 This is necessary also for there to be a point of indifference at which
 a consumer in a poor wealth band may trade places with another in a richer
 (higher) wealth band.
 It is only when both relative-social positioning and absolute possessions
 have utility for the consumer, when a rich consumer with low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 relative to a higher asset-band may trade places with someone in the poor
 neighborhood who has a higher (local) social-positioning.
 There would be no utility from status consumption in absence of this substituti
on.
 To illustrate this further, consider the consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 who live in a poor and a rich region respectively so that their non-durable
 consumption levels are 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{P},c_{R}$
\end_inset

 and the long-term durable goods owned by the richer consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is higher than those owned by the poorer consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 i.e.

 The cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P}$
\end_inset

 would evidently be lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P}<\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 and therefore the per-head excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 values are 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=\frac{c_{P}-\Psi_{P}}{\psi_{P}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{R}=\frac{c_{R}-\Psi_{R}}{\psi_{R}}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 If we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 have the same basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{P}=\psi_{R}$
\end_inset

, a status comparison through excess alone would imply that there may never
 be any two values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}\sim\nu_{R}$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 could trade places with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 as long as utility is a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

).
 The utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 is therefore of key importance in the model as it allows a big fish in
 a small pond - so to speak - to trade places with the small fish in a big
 pond.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the econometric analysis using the model we use a cost-function approach
 where the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

 towards utility is accounted for.
 The empirical concerns related with the appropriate size of the asset bands
 that serve as the reference point for status consumption are discussed

\end_inset

 that follows, it is worth pointing out how the visibility survey methods
 also infer the reference levels for inferences of status.
 This has often been accomplished through direct questionnaires (see Heffetz
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) - thus building a reference through a visibility index of various commodities.
 While the visibility approach (see Ireland 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

, Hopkins-Kornienko 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) permits a separability of necessary items from conspicuous item, it also
 assumes status items to be futile in the regular sense (an argument attributed
 to Veblen).
 The assumption that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular
 sense allows the visible consumption to be treated separable (additively)
 from the non-visible consumption utility - permitting us in turn to lump
 together the demand for conspicuous items into one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commodity.
 The tractability of models based on the visibility approach however comes
 at a cost since the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption must only
 include items that are commonly understood to have exclusive signaling
 value (see Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a discussion of the criteria).
 In the nascent modern economies of sub-Saharan Africa, we find this definition
 to be somewhat limiting since the bandwagon items such as electronics or
 cars pose obvious empirical concerns - since they are hardly futile but
 also serve carry status in the environment of recent urbanisation in the
 developing economies (see Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for criticism of rather belle epoque views of status consumption).
 Instead of the relying on the futility assumption therefore we prefer the
 notion of excess relative to one's asset-band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 - where relevant wealth differences in an economy have a direct role to
 play.
 The formulation allows us to focus on how a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 towards status could be constrained due to extreme wealth differences.
 We believe that such a model provides a more generic view of status consumption
 that would be applicable to status consumption observed across disparate
 economies.

Hierarchy of Consumer Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central claim that much of the model can be derived from is that status
 is a part of the consumer's long-term utility.
 If not, the representative consumer in the model would have no reason to
 engage in status-related consumption.
 As there is something to be gained from non-durable status-consumption
 towards status (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a consumer
 can achieve a higher status in the model by the acquisition of durable
 goods or through excess non-durable consumption relative to her social
 reference.
 While the non-durable consumption does not improve her ranking in the wealth
 order immediately, it may enhance social interactions, improve the consumer's
 self-image and is possible to achieve with an income lower than what may
 be required to acquire long-term durable items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The excess (non-durable consumption in excess of needs) provides both felicity
 and status advantage to the consumer - since all else being the same, someone
 with a habit of a higher quality is likely to have more status than someone
 consuming a lower quality relative to her reference group.
 Status consumption fulfills both short-term and long-term goals of the
 consumer - the former being fulfilled with non-durable consumption and
 the later with ownership of durable goods.
 It is also possible to view the social characteristics such as residence,
 neighborhood or social class as cumulative long-term status items that
 are acquired over multiple generations.
 As long as one may assume that the rewards of status are passed on to the
 progeny and that the social characteristics are aligned with wealth differences
, a social reference group relevant for status consumption can also be viewed
 as a wealth band in the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this temporal hierarchy of needs, social and wealth-band identities could
 be seen as the most permanent of all possessions - while the ownership
 of durable goods is more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 The representative consumer, once having addressed her basic needs, therefore
 attempts to distribute her total (income) outlay into the three variables
 - needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and permanent ownership 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Consumers within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 compete with the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 .
 The choice between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and

 assets

If we can assume that the needs of the consumer evolve with a deterministic

 in the direct utility model.
 Given such a substitution between

 For example, having an urban residence opens up the access to a wider market

 In household-related consumption, similarly, the high prices of housing

 This limitation could be severe in the developing economy where the costs

 So while unexpressed differences in wealth may be the very cause of status
 consumption, the model also allows the extremely wide wealth differences
 to segregate status competitions.
 This defines the context of

 both in the severely unequal societies of the developing economies and
 the urban settings where various social groups are bound together through
 economic developments.
 For as long as wealth matters towards status and the consumers of disparate
 wealth levels participate in a common status competition, one can be assured
 that the higher wealth differences would segregate the status competitions.

Empirical observations also confirm that the status items are tied to specific
 wealth levels - e.g.
 better food and beverages tend to indicate status at low wealth levels,
 luxury accessories at medium wealth levels and exclusive possessions (expensive
 watches, private jet access) at higher levels of wealth.
 There is evidence to the observation that the consumers with varied wealth-leve

 Status competitions thrive because we are consciously averse to committing

 Empirically, we evaluate the subsistence level in the context of sub-Saharan
 Africa using a basket of minimum food and energy requirements for an individual
 at the local market prices available in the survey.
 The exclusion of durable goods from subsistence and the view of excess

\end_inset

 (thus more assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

/ 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 mean more maintenance costs).
 Assuming also that the cost of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the same for the two consumers, the excess consumption for the urban
 and rural consumers would depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 how far apart the urban and rural wealth bands are.
 Thus an urban consumer who is poorer in absolute terms i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}<\Psi_{rural}$
\end_inset

 may enjoy a higher excess budget (
\begin_inset Formula $\because x-\Psi_{rural}-\delta<x-\Psi_{urban}-\delta$
\end_inset

) and a better position due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 (more rich residents reside in the urban area and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{urban}>\mathscr{A}_{rural}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{urban}$
\end_inset

 faces a different price from that of the rural consumer (who belongs to
 the band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{rural}$
\end_inset

 Despite the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 The overall position of the consumer is a combination of her relative position
 within the band as well as the effect of her 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 (the trait of being urban).
 If the rural consumer also faces a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 than the urban consumer, excess would help the rural consumer feel as having
 the same status as that of the urban consumer.
 Similarly when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}>\Psi_{rural}$
\end_inset

 , the excess budget of the rural consumer is higher (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}>\Psi_{rural}\Rightarrow x-\Psi_{urban}-\delta<x-\Psi_{rural}-\delta$
\end_inset

).
 The status of urban and rural consumers would be far apart unless the rural
 consumer has a lower cost 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 than the urban consumer.

 A substitution is thus possible between two bands

 only if

 a consumer is much further to her peers in the band

\end_inset

).
 Revisiting the previous example of the urban and rural consumers, consider
 the two consumers in successive bands

\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 who both have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 Extreme differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

\end_inset

-bands (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

 to dominate the comparisons between consumers from band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 A separation can similarly be caused also by 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 differences - which directly influence the excess consumption.
 Assuming that

 in the successive bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})$

\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})>P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 allows competititons with excess due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}+\Delta\mathscr{A})}<\frac{x-\Psi-\delta}{P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})}$
\end_inset

 (the indifference

 is made possible for the two consumers).
 The two consumers could thus exchange places with each other if

 As long as one may assume that participants compete in a market for status

The other less straightforward option - which does not require the consumer

\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset

 we rewrite the consumer budget as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
x_{t} & \equiv\Delta_{t}+c_{t}-\Psi-P_{\psi}\psi_{t}=\Delta_{t}+P_{\nu}\psi_{t}\nu_{t}\label{eq:x_t_definition}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subsistence costs therefore correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 (a zero outlay means the subsistence level expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Delta_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 due to our assumption of subsistence level not requiring any long-term
 possessions).
 A higher budget in the specification could be thus either spent on excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu\psi$
\end_inset

 or more long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 As the consumer acquires more durable goods her outlay could fall if the
 costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 rise.
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 by assumption and that the life-cycle effects are already part of the model
 since the effective outlay for excess decreases with increases in needs
 (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

).
 Two important claims are implied by the formulation that motivate our discussio
n of the econometric results in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Claim

\shape italic
Higher subsistence costs would suppress consumption on excess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a straightforward implication given the definition of the outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Higher subsistence prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 have the same effect as that of reducing the disposable outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 (relevant for excess) .
 It is implied also that of the two consumer wealth bands facing different
 subsistence costs, the band having the higher subsistence costs would have
 lower outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards status consumption.
 For a consumer closer to the subsistence level, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 would be low and a rise in subsistence costs would mean a minimal outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, a consumer further from subsistence i.e.
 with an outlay higher than subsistence level may substitute between owning
 more durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 more comfortably.
 The rise in subsistence prices for such a consumer lowers her budget for
 excess but not as much compared to a consumer who survives closer to subsistenc
e levels.
 That lowering the outlay at higher levels of the outlay does not drop the
 bliss (utility) as sharply as closer to the subsistence is evident from
 the shape of the PIGLOG curve as well (see Appendix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Claim

\shape italic
Status competitions are spurred as subsistence becomes cheaper and bliss
 becomes expensive in the PIGLOG formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of this claim is proven trivially.
 Subsistence becoming cheaper makes sure that more consumers participate
 in the status consumption.
 With the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we can see that rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
reduce the outlay for excess as well as permanent goods and thus discourage
 status competition.
 To explain how price-rises in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) could affect the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) for the second part, recall that the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is only with respect to a certain wealth band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is subject to the demand from consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 , the consumers within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 competing with excess would drive the price for excess
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

.
 Since the demand for status goods is limited to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 the substitution between permanent-ownership and excess would not be as
 if every consumer had a fixed demand for  excess which she adjusts as the
 price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rise and fall.
 Instead, when 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is driven by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

, a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may create more competition for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods leading to a rise in the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 The rise of prices of assets for consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 thus raises the price of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 On other other hand, too much of a drop in prices of assets could mark
 a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 .
 This is because if the rise in prices of assets is so much that a redistributio
n of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (wealth) ensues i.e.
 the consumers may sell their 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and move to the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, then the significant rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could lower the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 goods.
 Equivalently, when there is a small drop in price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, more consumers within the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band would stock 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 would fall.
 Again, the fall in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could be so much that there would be a lot many consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band and the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods would rise.
 This dynamics exists because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is specific to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 and prices of assets as well as excess are associated with status competitions
 (see Bilancini et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BILANCINIStatusRanking2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for similar arguments).
 The substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 due to price is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lumpy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a sense so that it occurs only for big changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and is irrelevant for small changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The positional demand dominates the price dynamics for small changes in
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
To consider the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 as the price for excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 changes, now consider how a rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 through introduction of new quality goods (newer technology, products etc.)
 could affect the prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The price of excess increases the status of only a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band and as a newer item is introduced, all other items may not have as
 much value towards status any more.
 The newly introduced item - which has a higher price - would thus slightly
 raise the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 .
 If the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands are intact, the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 should drop as 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rises due to a new item.
 Since excess is always tied to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, a more significant rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 through introduction of new items would make it worthwhile to downgrade
 or upgrade one's 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and enjoy a less intense 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in another 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band .
 The association of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 implies that the changes in price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 may never cause a redistribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the help of above dynamics we can now explain how bliss becoming more
 expensive through rise of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 amounts to the intensification of status competitions.
 Specifically, as small rises of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 move together, a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for consumer above subsistence does little to end the need for status competiti
ons as long as wealth or asset hierarchies stay the same.
 Without changes that transform the asset hierarchies, we can argue that
 bliss becoming more expensive amounts to more intense status competition.

Empirical Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A limitation of the excess approach we have adopted is that it does not
 differentiate among different excess across varied functional areas - an
 excess in food items is no different excess in clothes or entertainment
 in the framework.
 While in an itemwise analysis one considers the elasticities of status
 goods explicitly, excess treats a rural overspending on a traditional wedding
 ceremony the same as the urban spending on cable TV subscriptions.
 The excess approach is favoured nevertheless since it solves two key measuremen
t error issues for us.
 First is the lack of observed prices for categories such as clothing or
 entertainment in the survey data.
 Due to severe measurement errors in measure elasticities caused by using
 unit prices (i.e.
 average expenditure on clothing in lieu of clothing prices in the estimation)
 we limit ourselves to testing if excesses are separated across levels of
 asset-ownership hierarchies or not with the excess approach (see Gibson
 et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonKimQualityBog2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for measurement errors with unit prices).
 The second issue is the mixing of daily-diary and monthly diary which also
 is noted to result in measurement errors in calibration of item elasticities
 (see Deaton-Dreze 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who note this problem and use the ownership levels of the various durable
 goods as a proxy for living standards to get around measurement error problems).
 The excess approach avoids this issues by avoiding the aggregation of the
 cost of needs from costs of excess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A concern can also be raised due to our of use of food and energy needs
 as the base level for internal needs.
 Against the notion of excess, one could argue that the needs vary significantly
 within an economy.
 For example, urban expenditures - such as transportation and entertainment
 - are needs in an urban area but not in a rural area.
 This is hardly a issue if one can assume that all perceived needs that
 are not basic must either be a part of excess or costs associated with
 the wealth band - as the specified model does consider the needs that are
 either part of

e.g.
 with transportation ), the urban consumer - who has the same total expenditure
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as the rural consumer - has a less excess outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})\times\nu$
\end_inset

 due to higher transportation expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Psi)$
\end_inset

.
 The urban consumer with a lower excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 therefore is set to balance the utility from the trait of being urban (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}_{urban}$
\end_inset

) with having less excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 than the rural consumer.
 This is possible since the consumer uses both 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 to compare status.
 When the urban expenditure are a part of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})\times\nu$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 with entertainment which is always considered part of excess), a comparison
 of excess accompanies the comparison of asset ownership for status comparisons.
 Since the urban areas are always richer on the whole than rural areas,
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{urban})$
\end_inset

 is necessarily different from 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A}_{rural})$
\end_inset

.
 Our empirical analysis always views higher excess for the urban consumer
 availing more entertainment in relation to the asset hierarchy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 which the urban and rural consumer belong to.
 Therefore differences in urban and rural needs are interpreted in the model
 through differences in wealth band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our reluctance towards demarcating needs with varied social context is for
 two reasons - first is that there are no universal set of needs other than
 basic needs that we can agree upon.
 A rich person's needs must always appear futile to the poorer individual
 and therefore a certain bias is inherent in the classification of status-items.
 The identification of subjective necessities for a consumer is a task open
 to the subjective views of the researcher - a problem that we attempt to
 mitigate with a simpler identification of costs associated with assets.
 The second reason is the limitation implied by the empirical data.
 While it is true that an urban consumer having the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as the rural consumer may “feel” that her entertainment needs are higher
 due to peer effects, it is not consumption data itself that tells us whether
 the consumers move to urban areas to achieve a higher status or that the
 residents of the urban areas feel more pressures which represent a higher
 entertainment need (this is the same issue that one finds in the empirical
 identification of habit and quality in the demand literature).
 We prefer to not make either of such assertions and represent lifestyle
 differences in the rural area and the urban area - for example - only through
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

-dependent excess prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of arguing that certain needs are more important in the urban area,
 we argue only that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\mathscr{A})$
\end_inset

 in the urban area is different and could create a segregation in status
 items from the rural area.

\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

, a weaker economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 would imply a weak 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

-based separation.
 Stronger dependence of excesses on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 -ownership bands would similarly imply a strong separation.
 This is because separation in empirical data amounts to substitution of
 excesses between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands.
 Therefore if there is no separation across identified bands 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 , one would observe that for a significant number of consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\nu,A)=u(\nu',A')$
\end_inset

 for the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of the cost-function approach, the consumers in bands 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 paying the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,P_{\nu}(A))$
\end_inset

 could be said to face different prices in the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $c(u,P_{\nu}(A))=c(u,P_{\nu}(A'))$

\begin_layout Standard
Our empirical goal is to test the relative significance of the national
 level and local level of hierarchies with respect to excess.
 The two metrics we use for this purpose are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
local relative-position 
\series default
(
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

) score - which is the ratio of wealth of the higher band to that of the
 consumer and represents local hierarchy for a consumer.
 The logarithm wealth of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

higher band
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a consumer is the 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{th}$
\end_inset

 quantile of the logarithm of assets-value (AV) in the local area (determined
 with region and district) where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 higher than the consumer's own logarithm AV rank.
 Thus with 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.1$
\end_inset

 in a group of 100 consumers in a given area, a higher-band wealth for a
 consumer with 20% percentile local rank in log-AV would be the 30% quantile
 wealth in the area.
 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 score is essentially a local relative excpoverty metric - a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 implies the consumer relative poverty with respect to the the richer neighbour.
 Being rich in a predominantly rich area would therefore result in a lower
 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 for a consumer than being poor in a rich neighbourhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\series bold
national relative-position
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $NR$
\end_inset

) score - observes the same metric at a top-level i.e.
 across all consumers in the economy.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $NR$
\end_inset

 metric thus represents the consumer's position in the national-level wealth
 hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relative important of above metrics help us comment if local peer effects
 are more important to the consumer than the wider-level wealth differences.
 If excesses depend weakly on difference wealth bands at the local level
 ( 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 ) but strongly on the national level difference (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

), then status competitions are limited to the local region and the region
 is relatively separated from other regions.
 The local peer effects would thus drive excess consumption when excesses
 depend weakly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 but strongly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 (this could happen either if the consumer  resides in a relatively rich
 region or in a relatively poor region).
 On the other hand, if we find a weak significance 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 for excess but a stronger dependence of excess on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

, then separation exists at local levels i.e.
 the difference between rich and poor is significant at local levels.
 The rich consumer may therefore competing at a wider (national) level when
 the separation is strong at local levels (excess changes significantly
 across bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 but varies weakly across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 ).
 It is possible to have weak significance across both hierarchies - implying
 that excesses are not particularly separated at either levels or that there
 is strong dependence across both hierarchies - implying the consumers have
 their excesses within the limits of the position in the local hierarchies
 and are further separated by regional wealth at the wider levels.

The empirical results from the Tanzanian have been interpreted using these
 arguments.
 The above also motivates non-parametric approach for classification of

Cost of Needs and Excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each wave of the survey, we use both the consumption diary of food items
 and the recall diary of non-food items to compute the cost of needs of
 the consumer - summing up the expenditure on the items that are considered
 necessities.
 The basic necessities comprise of food and energy - both of which appear
 in the weekly consumption diaries whereas energy and transport which contribute
d to cost of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 appear in the monthly expenditure diaries.
 The cost of basic needs is the cost of minimal requirements for food and
 energy observed at the district level of consumer's residence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost of basic needs therefore directly depends on the market-prices
 available in the survey for each locality.
 For example, within food category, we use the price of cheapest item in
 the set of minimum requirements for carbohydrates, fat, protein and fruits-vege
tables sub-categories observed at the district level.
 The cost of the minimal basket per head - composed of the recommended nutrient
 quantities - is calculated using the prices recorded in the survey and
 the number of members in the household.
 As it turns out, this minimum-cost basket for most regions (districts)
 is a selection of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - the items that
 are cheapest items in every sub-category.
 The cost of the basket thus calculated is evidently much higher in the
 urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar treatment for energy category shows kerosene as the cheapest option
 for energy usage in most of Tanzania– partly due the sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 With a calorie quota for lighting and the preparation of a typical meal
 (using the data on lighting and cooking available for every household in
 the survey), we infer the cost basis needs for energy using the recommended
 quantities of kerosene, charcoal and other energy sources (see Lam et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LamSmith2012Kerosene"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and https://energypedia.info/ for data on typical energy usage in the developing
 countries).
 The expenditure on clothing,
\series bold
 
\series default
housing needs as well as those in the transport category (e.g.
 the public-transport costs and petrol consumption costs) are considered
 not as part of basic needs but as part of the costs of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-level (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the availability of market prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 at the district level in the survey and the detailed record of the members
 of the households reduce the measurement errors associated the cost of
 internal needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 , the concerns of seasonality and fixed effects deter the association of
 inferred excess consumption with a particular household.
 The empirical measurement of excess therefore observes 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu$
\end_inset

 at the level of wealth-band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 itself.
 On the hand, the expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (the costs incurred due to maintenance, usage and upkeep of the long-term
 durable goods) are observed for individual households in the survey.

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the durable good purchases in the recall diaries (see items with

\end_inset

 in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{itemsclassification}
\end_layout

\end_inset

), a particularly relevant dataset in the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey ranges from short-term
 durable items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets
 such as land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 Our classification of long-term durable goods is based on intergenerational
 transfers - so an item is included in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and in turn as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 only if it can be passed on through generations
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An empirical criterion for consideration of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is also that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 should increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (there are no assets that can be maintained without any costs).
 This avoids an assets-interpretation of certain social characteristics
 such as education or club-membership - which may be acquired over a life-time,
 require some investment (fees for education or club membership) and even
 have a definite value in the market (e.g.
 employment market).
 Such personal characteristics (e.g.
 education) are not considered as assets simply because they don't carry
 any maintenance costs.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The details of records in the dataset include the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 the household expects by selling the durable good in the market at the
 time of the survey.
 We refer to the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 that the household expects by selling the durable good in the market as
 marked-to-market average or simply mtm average in the foregoing discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 - being a recall value - is particularly sensitive to measurement errors.
 Recorded by the survey at two different time-points spread across two years
 (let's call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs can change over the period of two years - possibly
 also due to a different member of the same household providing the estimate
 in the two different years.
 The change in value of durable goods using 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 from year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 2012) to year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 2014 ) is therefore subject to severe measurement errors as the reported
 cost of the same durable good in 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (2012) may differ significantly from the cost reported in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 (2014) .
 We thus use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods (i.e.
 the mtm average) to infer the wealth bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 as they are not recalled from consumer's memory but instead reflects the
 perceived depreciation of the durable good over time - an issue which is
 better handled by averaging over the identified band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is obtained by multiplying
 the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue in recording difference assets over time is that of split
 households.
 If household splits between years 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, the durable goods recorded in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would record a drop in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 if the household had been split.
 Noting that only round 10% of the households were split in the periods
 2010-2012 and in 2012-2014 we avoid the issue by ignoring the split households
 for our analyses.
 Also, since the waves of the survey are not panel data in the true sense
 (the household visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is likely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 but very unlikely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+2$
\end_inset

), we present the fixed effects regression for consumption within the two
 year period(s).

 The ratios 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$

w_{\Delta A}=\frac{\Delta A_{t}}{\nu_{t}\psi_{t}P_{\nu,t}+\Delta A_{t}}=\frac{\Delta A_{t}}{c_{t}-\Psi_{t}-P_{\psi}\psi+\Delta A_{t}}\label{eq:BudgetMeasure_A}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$

 is interpreted as the demand for excess while 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the price associated with a particular wealth band 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 Apart from the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

, the price of needs is also used as a control variable for the excess budget
 ratio - since a higher cost of needs could cause the consumer to save more
 .
 The prices being observed account for relative impoverishment in the economy

\begin_layout Standard
To establish that observing budget ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is a measure for excess as appropriate as the amount spent towards excess
 that the consumers compete with - let’s consider three consumers - first
 of them is rich (with assets valued at 4,000,000), the second middle-income
 (assets valued at 900,000) and the third poor (assets valued at 10,000).
 Assuming the maintenance costs are simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A}$
\end_inset

 (for the value of asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) and the cost of basic needs the same (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi=200$
\end_inset

), the excess can be inferred as shown in the tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:highwnu"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Lowwnu"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The consumer spending more on assets in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Lowwnu"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 has a lower expenditure on excess and thus a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 If the rich in the example has both a higher excess and higher asset value
 then a separation is indicated applies and there can be no competition
 among the consumers.
 This is the state of the status competition in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Lowwnu"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, if per-head excess of rich and poor consumers overlap
 we have less separation - as is the case in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:highwnu"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the robustness of our measure of excess, we also use the subjective
 well-being data from the survey.
 If excesses are used to offset existing wealth hierarchies, we should find
 that those who are not satisfied with their financial status would have
 higher excess.
 Our empirical tests find that after accounting for wealth levels (durable
 goods ownership) those who are satisfied do have less recorded excess.
 That said, one cannot use this confirmation to decide whether a consumer
 has a higher excess due to not having a any options to purchase long-term
 assets or due to extreme peer pressures in her asset-band.
 This is once again due to the arguments we have discussed in the Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Empirical-Method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 What we can ascertain however is that for the same total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, those with less assets consistently feel dissatisfied and have higher
 excess levels.
 The exceptions are indeed those extremely unsatisfied consumers who are
 also often extremely poor and have low excess.
 Similarly, extremely satisfied consumers in the higher asset band also
 have less excess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we look into the fixed effects influencing the consumer's excess
 in more detail, consider how our conclusions on the variation of excess
 across wealth bands match up with the itemwise analysis which would have
 followed if the prices of individual items purchased were available in
 the survey.
 Consider an example where we have expenditure data on phones for a 1000
 families and we are able to determine that 200 of the 1000 consumers are
 rich, 400 are middle-income and the rest 400 are poor.
 Assume that we also have the data on their age and composition of the household.
 If we observe that some of them have much higher monthly expenditure on
 phones than others, then choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

basic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 expenditure on phone as the fees for landline, we may declare all expense
 higher than the landline costs as the excess.
 The argument that the individual’s communication needs are not down to
 landline costs is a valid one – considering that a consumer might have
 more family members living away, she may be conducting occupational calls
 using her phone or may simply be more talkative than others.
 Since we observe excess at the level of the wealth band however - such
 effects can be aggregated away and the effect of factors such as the number
 of family members, the regional effects etc.
 assessed.
 This is one reason why prices being observed locally is key to our analysis
 of excess as it proxies the regional differences in the economy.
 Had we used national level prices for calculating the costs of basic needs,
 the inferred excess at local levels would be rather meaningless.
 To sum up, as long as we can assume that landline is indeed a basic expense,
 we know how the excess varies in the population without a knowledge of
 the prices of every expensive phone variety.
 We can also conclude whether separation exists in the population of 1000
 families or not by observing if the excess is aligned with the observed
 bands 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{A}$
\end_inset

 or not (i.e.
 if the consumers in the poorer band 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 have consistently different excess from those in the richer band 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

).
 Such a conclusion is equivalent to the one whether the expenditure on particula
r types of phones is available in the survey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the goal to decide the relative importance of local vs national wealth
 hierarchies, we use the 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $NR$
\end_inset

 metrics (representing the relative wealth of the individual in the region
 and that at the national level respectively) in the fixed-effects regression
 - using them as control variables along with 
\begin_inset Formula $log(P_{\psi})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{t})$
\end_inset

 .
 The dependent variables in the regression are 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu},w_{A}$
\end_inset

.
 If a poor consumer who both has a low 
\begin_inset Formula $NR$
\end_inset

 but a high 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 score then we would conclude that she is in a poor region.
 Similarly, if she has high 
\begin_inset Formula $NR$
\end_inset

 score but low 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 score then she would be considered in a rich region.
 Further, if a separation is implied either locally or nationally - the
 competition with the richer consumer would be futile or impossible (a distincti
on that cannot be made by looking at the consumption data alone).
 In such a case when there is separation across wealth bands, lower excess
 is implied as the either of scores rise.
 The relative significance of the 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 score or the 
\begin_inset Formula $NR$
\end_inset

 score can tell us if the separation applies to the entire region (district)
 the consumer is a part or within her own community in the region where
 she resides.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $NR$
\end_inset

 metrics thus summarise the role of regional disparities towards consumption
 in the economy as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the results presented in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessFEAll}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we find that the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $LR$
\end_inset

 dominates over the 
\begin_inset Formula $NR$
\end_inset

.
 This indicates that excess is more often driven by local wealth hierarchy.
 The differences excess are more significant with respect to the local hierarchy
 even in the economy of the hinterland where there is evidence of more sensitivi
ty with respect to the cost of the needs basket.
 This is evident from the results in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessFEExpensive}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 which show the estimation results from the sub-populations that reside
 in expensive regions - i.e.
 Dar-es-Salaam, Mbeya, Mwanza and Mjini-Magharibi/Zanzibar (region codes
 7, 12, 19 and 53 determined by high expenditure on commodities) - and outside
 of the expensive regions respectively.
 This is also meant to highlight the difference in excess in areas that
 have higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 due to availability of electricity and costs associated with electric/electroni
c assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since it is possible that the regression is dominated by the data in densely
 populated urban areas, we also present separate results of the regression
 for the urban areas and non-urban regions.
 With the results in 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessFERural}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessFEUrban}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 , there seems higher dependence on basis needs costs in the rural areas.
 This does suggest subsistence level consumption in the rural areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the combined view of rural and urban areas does not provide the
 evidence of a widespread poor underlcass with suppressed excess opportunities.
 To support this finding, we also look at how excess could vary across asset
 band indicator variables.
 The result of an estimation with control variables indicating one of three
 asset bands - defined as 0-30% quantile, 30-65% quantile and 66%-100% quantile
 of the logarithm of owned durable goods values - is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessFEABand}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As is evident from the results, the excess seems higher only for the highest
 quantile of wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of data on social group identity prevents a more detailed understanding
 of the effect of social differences in the economy.
 That said, the ratio of people who speak English in the band to the total
 number of people in the band is not a significant indicator of excess consumpti
on.
 In conclusion, the differences in urban and rural lifestyles play a major
 role in the difference in durable good purchases as well as excess.
 This seems in particular due to the availability of electricity being limited
 to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable good purchases
 in the urban areas - but they do not seem to competing with the rural area
 residents who have their own local reference level.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis had been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption in an environment of uneven prices for excess consumption.
 This is motivated by the direct and dominant role played by the extreme
 differences in wealth and the segregation of quality of life in the developing
 countries.
 The variation in consumption above basic needs with respect to the distribution
 of durable goods in the economy views status consumption in a more general
 context.
 In the context of a developing country, when the majority of households
 have very little disposable income and durable goods possessions, the status
 consumption in the society would not be limited to the conventionally visible
 items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 For example, the Tanzanian data shows that most houses report metallic
 sheet and bamboo/thatch roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing.
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs may seem to be a case of visible consumption
 at first - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries of
 home ownership rather than visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may therefore not provide us the desired view of how status
 may be signalled in the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find that the effect of rural and urban differences on status consumptio
n is easier explained with the formulation of status consumption in terms
 of permanent ownership and excess.
 The explanation of how wide differences in wealth levels could affect consumer'
s the view of status consumption enhances our understanding how status competiti
ons may work under severe inequalities in more general settings.
 It is hoped that with the demand across different markets standardised
 with the suggested framework could help us understand factors that influence
 status consumption across the disparate variety of economies.

PIGLOG costs functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To detail the limitation of an additive loglinear utility, consider a general
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\beta_{i}log(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, if the budget constraint is set to be 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}$
\end_inset

, then the optimisation using a Lagrangian leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $L=u-\lambda(\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}-x)$
\end_inset

.
 The first-order conditions imply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
x=\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}\\
\frac{\beta_{i}}{q_{i}-\gamma_{i}}=\lambda p_{i}
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})=1$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})=\beta_{i}(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 the Marshallian demand function
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The indirect utility function - of which cost function is the inverse of
 - can be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
u & =\sum{\beta_{i}}log(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}(x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}))
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{k}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have:

u=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})+\sum\beta_{i}log((x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}))\Rightarrow u=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})+log(x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}})
\end{gather*}

\end_inset

The cost function thus becomes:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
log(c(u,\textbf{p})-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}) & =u-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})\label{eq:loglineargeneral}

 up linearly with the logarithm of outlay i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{log(x)-a(p)}{b(p)-a(p)}$
\end_inset

A useful intuition for the PIGLOG cost-functions (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) is its view as a linear decomposition of the logarithm of outlay (
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

) into costs of subsistence (
\begin_inset Formula $u=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$
\end_inset

) and bliss (
\begin_inset Formula $u=1$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p)$
\end_inset

).
 In this form, the cost function in the Equation

 would be written as:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
log(c(u,\textbf{p})-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}) & =(1-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}))u+(-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}))(1-u)

The cost-function formulation shows just how restrictive a loglinear direct
 utility function really is.
 The above direct utility form of the loglinear utility claims that the
 price derivatives of cost-functions (which are typically equated with the
 budget ratio in the econometric analysis i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial p_{i}}$
\end_inset

) are the same for both subsistence and bliss sub-utilities.
 This is a strong assumption if one were to consider status utility using
 the loglinear formulation.

Thus for the consumer choice between consuming value 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 (which the consumer avails in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) and increasing asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, a general PIGLOG cost-function would allow the sensitivity of savings
 rate (choice between consuming in the current period vs saving for future)
 with respect to prices of excess and durable goods to be different at subsisten
ce and bliss levels.
 The cost-function can still be used to describe the dynamics of the model
 just equally well.
 Much the way a direct utility function under a budget constraint explains
 that a higher price makes it difficult to obtain the same utility (comprising
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{q}=\{q_{i}\}$
\end_inset

), the cost-function approach shows how a higher price causes a consumer
 to avail less utility for the same cost (
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

).
