\begin_layout Title
Status consumption under wealth inequalities 
\begin_inset Newline newline

- a case study in Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role played by wealth
 inequalities and exclusion in the varied contexts of developing economies
 is explored less often.
 We develop a model for status consumption by viewing the permanent ownership
 and the expenditure in excess of needs as the primary indicators of status
 in a framework of intertemporal substitution.
 Incorporating opposing effects of peer influences and extreme wealth difference
s on status competitions in the model, we use the data on durable goods
 ownership from the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata to discuss how
 a segregation of overall quality in an environment of price heterogeneity
 may characterise status consumption in a developing economy.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical studies in both developed and developing economies have associated
 social segmentation in an economy with disproportionate spending on conspicuous

.
 While some such disparities could be explained with the relevance of reference
 groups, the empirical studies are often confronted with the problems arising
 from the varied social contexts of status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With an aim to use a generic model for status consumption that can be extended
 across the developed and developing economies, we treat the role of spatial
 and economic boundaries explicitly in the model by considering the opposing
 roles of peer effects and wealth differences on status consumption.
 We note that on one hand, peer effects are meant to encourage status consumptio
n while on the other the extreme wealth differences have a necessary effect
 of making visible consumption appear futile since the consumers can hardly
 overcome glaring (and thus visible) wealth differences.
 Seeking conditions under which the demand for conspicuous goods may be
 reduced (or even absent) in spatially or economically separated reference
 groups

\end_layout

\end_inset

, we develop a model for status consumption that interprets status in a
 context of socio-economic differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If consumers were strictly segregated across spatial or socio-economic boundarie
s (e.g.
 class, region, race etc.), then status consumption would be necessarily
 segmented across the segregated groups.
 But status competitions are hardly limited to one's own reference group
 in our interconnected world - the consumers both compare themselves with
 the participants in their own reference groups and infer status of other
 reference groups which they don't belong to.
 Whether the extent of visible consumption associated to a particular social
 is driven by the level of segregation in an economy or not is a quantitative
 concern that must be explained with a relevant context for status and wealth
 differences.
 The poorer consumers - despite the supposed tendency to embrace the habits
 of those slightly richer than them - may not emulate the rich 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is the idea of pecuniary emulation noted by Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 i.e.
 the notion that the habits of the rich are emulated by the poorer consumers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 when the latter are a microscopic minority in a largely impoverished economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore the opposing effects of wealth differences and peer-influences
 on status consumption in quantitative terms, we fall back on the notion
 of how status consumption is used to offset existing inequalities in income
 and economic standing.
 Instead of focusing on the disproportionate demand for signaling-goods
 (i.e.
 conspicuous consumption), therefore we adopt a model based on a social-deferenc
e view of status that has been embraced in many economic studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Here, status is seen in a wealth hierarchy that the consumer tries to offset
 (at least partly) with status-related consumption.
 More specifically, any two consumers who carry the same personal characteristic
s and have the same set of needs can compete with each other for status
 both with excess non-durable consumption (above cost of needs) and long-term
 durable goods.
 For an empirical measurement of status consumption, we use the permanent
 ownership of items (owned long-term goods) and the non-durable consumption
 in excess of needs.
 The cost of needs is inferred as the cost of owning long-term goods and
 the cost of basic needs varying across regions.
 After adjusting for her needs, a consumer is expected to optimise the utility
 she obtains from both excess and long-term possessions.
 Social or spatial characteristics matter to the consumer in this model
 through the durable goods cluster which the consumer belongs to as well
 as the price of excess and the cost of basic needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In popular culture, status consumption often evokes images of wasteful expenditu
re and exclusive possessions that provide no economic value other than an
 attraction to people of equal affluence.
 Thus whether a consumer's newly acquired wealth - whether it be jewelry
 of acquisition of undervalued land or property - needs to be considered
 part of her necessities for higher status or wasteful conspicuous consumption
 is subjected to an endless debate.
 Since we have no way of knowing the real intentions of a consumer by evaluating
 their consumption diaries, we are left with measurements of existing  wealth
 and our own notion of necessities.
 There are two key preconditions for in the empirical analysis based on
 the model.
 The first is that there exist some basic needs in an economy – so that
 rich don’t have needs different from the poor – but only different levels
 of excess over basic needs (apart from differences in their long-term possessio
ns).
 Notice that our notion of excess excludes any maintenance costs for the
 long-term possession e.g.
 if you have a car, petrol is not an excess and also contributes to their
 status along with the assets.
 The second precondition is that the differences in bands of long-term possessio
ns would create differences in price of excess.
 With these, adding more durable goods to one's wealth or achieving more
 excess would thus both create a higher status –even if the a chances of
 perceived social mobility are low.
 With these two assumption we infer the extent of status consumption as
 the combination of excess and durable goods purchases in the economy.
 The claim we test empirically is whether the excess is affected by relative
 competition in the asset bands or the absolute regional differences due
 to spatial or economic exclusion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key advantage with the above approach is that unlike the studies in visible
 consumption, we need not rely on the assumption that conspicuous items
 are futile.
 While the futility assumption implicitly ensures the separability of demand
 for visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004,ireland_signals"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in an empirical analysis, it neither encompasses status consumption fully
 nor does it provide a clear separation for visibility in bandwagon items
 such as electronics or cars that may both serve utility in the regular
 sense and provide status advantage.
 We thus avoid the futility assumption and interpret the more general notion
 of quality as excess that permits any high-price non-durable consumption
 or a durable good to contribute to status - a notion which we feel is necessary
 to represent the conditions of a developing economy.
 Our approach may be allow to test the significance of status consumption
 across economies without relying on proxies of cultural contexts (e.g.
 visibility surveys

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen has explored the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.

 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

 We argue that this recent attention to status consumption need not to be

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A robust empirical measure of quality has been subject to much debate in
 the literature - due in part to the lack of sufficiently detailed consumption
 surveys.
 Most consumption surveys hardly record the market-observed prices or the
 quantities of the items consumed - let alone the brand-related details
 of the items.
 The market-prices of items purchases or even quantities consumed - which
 could permit us to view quality as the proportion of expensive items standardis
ed by quantity (see Nelson

 Since we are concerned only with value of consumption towards status rather
 than the estimation of quality elasticities, we rely on the notion of excess
 which depends only on the market-observed prices of needs and the total
 reported expenditure.

), the notion of status most commonly used in literature - seen merely as
 a long-term characteristics of the consumer - does not associate social
 identity with consumption sufficiently well (also see the marketing literature
 on identity formation and acquired goods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gierl_scarcity,Eastman1999"

\end_inset

).
 The view of status as a static characteristic in fact poses an obvious
 paradox with respect consumption - since there cannot be any utility from
 status-consumption if status were only accumulated over a long-term.
 The paradox is trivially resolved if one considers that status is subject
 to change with consumption - just the way it is shaped by income or education
 (see Michelson et al.

 and having been widely embraced in the economic studies - presents status
 as an income-based ranking order that can be altered by the consumer with
 consumption.
 A consumer thus achieves status utility through status consumption by moving
 herself up in a ranking order that is otherwise determined by wealth and
 income.
 A model that that views consumption in the context of status as a ranking
 order based on income or wealth could be used to endogenise the role of
 social identity in conspicuous consumption as well.
 This is the view used in our intertemporal formulation of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To delineate the role which social characteristics and identities play in
 status consumption further, we consider how wealth differences may matter
 towards status consumption.
 Instead of assuming that the status-indicating goods in a developing country
 must be the same as those that are considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed economies, we consider the role that wealth differences
 could play towards status differences in the developed economies - arguing
 that the wealth differences may be far too wide and important for the limited
 range of available visible items to matter in the status competitions in
 developing economies (where industrial development is concentrated into
 fewer urban areas).
 The relevance of wealth differences in status consumption has not been
 discussed in much detail in the literature on conspicuous consumption we
 have surveyed (except for some studies directly exploring the effect income
 inequality on conspicuous consumption with exogenously observed poverty/income
 levels or GINI indices - see Jaikumar

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The inclusion of long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in status-related consumption has been rather arbitrary in much
 of the literature.
 Viewing status consumption in the context of wealth differences could also
 guide the assessment of whether a particular long-term durable good should
 be viewed as part of status consumption or not.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An obvious issue with viewing social identities in the same ranking order
 as that of wealth is that of scope associated with social identities.
 While some social identities may be perceived to be of higher status than
 others, the individuals that are too poor or too different from other groups
 might not compare themselves with those that are either too rich or too
 different from themselves.
 That the competitions to reach a higher status are segmented by social
 identities has been confirmed in quite a few empirical studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace,KausSA"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The role that social identities play towards consumption thus gets complicated
 as the social identities both i) limit the status consumption within themselves
 and ii) carry a status value (higher or lower) to those outside the respective
 social groups (see Timothy

 for an empirical perspective on reference groups).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We simplify this view by considering that it is only outside the reference
 group driven by one's identity that a social identity may influence status
 the way wealth differences would.
 Within the scope of the social identity that determines a reference group,
 the social identity doesn't carry much status to those belonging to the
 reference group (since everybody carries the same social identity).
 This does imply that the lower economic classes may no longer unconditionally
 emulate the habits of upper economic classes (pecuniary emulation) or even
 participate in the same status competitions as those who are perceived
 to have higher status - since the social identities limit status competitions
 within themselves (see Ustuner-Holt

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (which is how a researcher may obtain the list of visible items) is adjusted
 to include items that may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Since social identities are themselves often a result of long-term wealth
 differences, the problem that social differences are not wealth differences
 does not arise in most empirical studies.
 To look at the segmentation in status consumption due to socio-economic
 stratification in more detail, we use the condition that beyond a certain
 limit of differences in wealth hierarchy, a given status item may not be
 of value to the poorer consumer(s).
 The conditions around such a break in excess prices are developed by generalisi
ng the idea of segmentation of status consumption across the levels (bands)
 of income and wealth in an economy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An empirical analysis with this model relies on two key measurements - the
 wealth of a consumer (which can be proxied relatively easily if the stock
 of durable goods possessed by consumer - inclusive of housing, land and
 other long-term assets - is available) and the non-durable consumption
 in excess of needs - which we hereforth refer to as excess.
 Here, the fulfillment of basic needs is not meant to offer an advantage
 to the consumer in a status competition.
 A consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) measured as excess - in other words - would have higher status
 than another consumer who consumes less quality (excess) while the needs
 of the two consumers are the same.
 If basic needs of the two consumers being compared are the same and their
 difference in needs arise only out of their long-term possessions, then
 the addressing of needs alone does not provide any status utility than
 what is provided by the long-term possessions or characteristics.
 It follows that if there is any status related utility to be derived from
 non-durable consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from excess
 (which is defined as distance from all needs tied to a particular reference
 group).
 It also follows that any status in a particular reference group that is
 not signaled with excess must come out of the possession of (and thus utility
 from) the long-term durable goods (or the proxy of wealth).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical measurement of excess requires i) the costs associated with
 the durable goods and ii) higher-than-required consumption based on a minimum
 necessary consumption.
 The costs of durable goods are easy to obtain as they are often available
 as part of the consumer diary.
 The variation in the cost of a standard basket of basic needs across the
 regions and districts can be estimated with the market prices in the survey.
 As long as the basic needs of the consumer and the possession of the long-term
 durable goods can be determined in an economy, the

can be easily determined.
 However, an empirical assessment of what is consider

 supersede a consumer's subjective interests (wants).

 lean towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough

 theory argued for by Doyal and Gough

We interpret the ideas of health and autonomy as the basic (or internal)
 needs of the consumer in a particular cultural setting - driven by the
 biological needs of the household (represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - the number of household-members, number of children, individual age,
 body weight etc.).
 Excess must also exclude the consumer's external needs which encompass
 more than her health and autonomy.
 These are considered as part of the costs associated with the long-term
 possessions of the consumer.
 Consider for example the question of whether lodging/home-ownership or
 the primary education of children in the area where a consumer resides
 should be considered a basic need or not.
 Evidently, such needs are determined by a social reference rather than
 biology.
 Using the biological needs alone as the reference level consumption amounts
 to ignoring the the peer effects that have a role in choice for status
 goods.
 The utility that a consumer avails from excess depends on her perception
 of what she considers necessary (which comprise of the external needs)
 rather than what is dictated by biology alone.
 The inclusion of peer effects - external needs which we measure as costs
 associated with the consumer's possessions - are thus necessary in a measure
 for excess as it determines the reference consumption level for the consumer.
 Both the basic-needs basket - the internal needs whose cost varies with
 observed prices in a given region - and the cost of possessions - the external
 needs that account for the social or spatial context of the consumer (identifie
d by the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and the wealth measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 of the consumer) form the basis for our measure of excess.

 The measurement of excess considers the reference group's consumption level
 as part of the consumer's external needs that are not counted towards excess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost of external needs - encompassing the maintenance and upkeep costs
 for the long-term durable goods a consumer inherits or purchases over time-
 directly contribute to the non-durable consumption and increase the reference
 level of the consumer needs.
 We denote such cost of external needs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of needs of a consumer are therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi+\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is measure of the basic needs of a consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the wealth measure (proxied with the value of long-term durable goods
 etc.) and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 is the cost of needs in a particular locality.
 The consumer's consumption of everything else that is not included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 counts towards the consumer's excess (relative to her social reference
 comprising of wealth measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and demographic characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 By owning long-term durable goods (as a measure of wealth) 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the consumer essentially improves her social-reference and aims to get
 ahead of others by maximising her stock of durable goods relative to the
 reference possession level (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the reference ownership level for characteristic/identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 Another way to look at the consumer's long-term possessions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is that of a commitment which leads to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)+P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 (we detail this further in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Hierarchy-of-Consumer-Needs"

\end_inset

).
 The net cost of needs provided by such a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and the expenditure on excess availed by the consumer constitute the total
 expenditure on non-durable consumption by the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The total non-durable consumption for the consumer can thus be written
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu\psi P_{\nu}+\Psi(A)+P_{\psi}\psi$

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that status is not considered an internal need using this approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for excess and the level
 of durable goods ownership she achieves while her internal needs remain
  independent of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both expensive
 durable goods and excess (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class internal needs
 of the consumer).
 Thus at a normative level, the difference between the status of a rich
 and that of a poor family is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 both the families combined with a disparate demand for excess in education.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To consider a direct utility function from the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,\nu,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 so far, notice that while the consumer does avail utility within her own
 social reference (specified by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

), a utility function should represent the case where all consumers from
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are permitted to rank (compare) each other.
 This is a necessary condition for us to define a common utility function
 applicable to all consumers.
 Since status differences do exist across social reference groups as well
 (e.g.
 individuals in one region compare themselves to those from other regions),
 it follows that a consumer must get some utility from the identity of one's
 social reference in order for there to be a higher (lower) status utility
 obtained with a richer (poorer) identity (e.g.
 region, class etc.).
 If this weren't true - i.e.
 if the consumers could get utility inclusive-of-status only from their
 durable goods value and non-durable consumption - then there could be no
 point of indifference at which a consumer in the poor neighborhood could
 trade places with another in a richer neighborhood.
 For status consumption to have some utility to the consumer, the utility
 function - which is the same for all consumers - must also depend on group
 identity in some way so that a rich consumer with low-positioning could
 be potentially convinced to trade places with someone in the poor neighborhood
 who has a higher (local) social-positioning.
 The i) common utility function for all consumers and ii) the status-related
 consumption allow the small fish in a big pond - so to speak - to trade
 places with a big fish in a small pond.
 The utility from a reference group identity and the social positioning
 within the reference group are both key to our model of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering an example to illustrate how two consumers may compete for a
 utility inclusive of status, let us assume there are consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 who live in poor (small pond) and rich (big pond) regions respectively
 so that their non-durable consumption levels are 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{P},c_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The average consumption levels in the regions they reside are 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Let's also assume that the values of their respective long-term durable
 goods bear the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}<A_{R}$
\end_inset

 .
 The same is true for the average asset ownership of the regions 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 ,
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 <
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 If we now consider the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P}<\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 then the per-head excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=\frac{c_{P}-\Psi_{P}}{\psi_{P}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{R}=\frac{c_{R}-\Psi_{R}}{\psi_{R}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the same needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{P}=\psi_{R}$
\end_inset

, if i) the status utility were to be achieved only through durable goods
 and excess, ii) the needs cost the same for both the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and if iii) the utility were a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

, then there may never be any two values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{P},A_{P})\sim(\nu_{R},A_{R})$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 could trade places (ponds) with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 The dependence of utility function on being 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 or being 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 - through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\psi)$
\end_inset

 or directly with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - is necessary for this indifference to exist.
 Such a utility allows 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 to increase her excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}$
\end_inset

 so that she is indifferent to moving to an urban area even for a higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that the differences between the urban and rural area are expressible
 in terms of average (total) long-term possessions in the areas.

 It is worth highlighting at this stage that the visibility survey methods

Assuming that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular sense
 - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for visible consumption
 can be considered separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 For the empirical analyses, probably the most desirable feature of visiblity
 based models is the separability of necessary items from conspicuous items
 - a property that is offered by assuming that the conspicuous items are
 futile (an argument attributed to Veblen).
 To accommodate this assertion, the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 includes items that are commonly understood to have exclusive signaling
 value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 In nascent modern economies of sub-Saharan Africa, however, we find that
 the bandwagon items such as electronics or cars pose obvious empirical
 concerns as they are hardly futile but also serve status needs due to the
 rapid and recent urbanisation in the economies.
 The futility assumption is not suitable for a model that is cognisant of
 wide differences in the long-term possessions of the consumers in a developing
 economy.
 We therefore use a different approach to status consumption that is based
 on the role that long-term durable goods may play towards status in an
 intertemporal setting.
 In an elaboration of the model with a varying cost of excess based on wealth
 levels, we also consider the conditions under which the substitution between
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\nu$
\end_inset

 could be constrained.
 We believe that such a model would be more generic for it to be applied
 across other developing economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the utility function we choose for long-term and short-term
 consumer goals does not view status consumption as futile but relates it
 with the attempts to alter a hierarchy of wealth and social identity.
 In this model, status cannot be changed by fulfillment of basic needs but
 is influenced both by long-term possessions and non-durable consumption
 of the consumer in an intertemporal setting.

Hierarchy of Consumer Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The claim about status that much of the model rests upon is that status
 is a part of the consumer's long-term utility.
 If not, the representative consumer in the model would have no reason to
 engage in status-related consumption.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption towards status (otherwise consumers would know of its
 futility), a consumer can achieve a higher status in the model by the acquisiti
on of durable goods (which is assisted with higher income) as well as by
 the status promotion through excess non-durable consumption - which may
 enhance social interactions, improve the consumer's self-image and is possible
 to achieve with lower income.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have discussed before, the role of non-durable consumption is two-fold
 in the model - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer
 and second, it achieves status-related goals.
 The excess (non-durable consumption in excess of needs) provides both felicity
 and status advantage - since all else being the same, someone with a habit
 of a higher quality is likely to have more status than someone consuming
 a lower quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that the utility from status consumption is a combination of short-ter
m and long-term goals of the consumer - where the short-term goals are fulfilled
 with non-durable consumption and the long-term goals through ownership
 of durable goods.
 The social characteristics such as residence, neighborhood or social class
 could be viewed as cumulative status items that are acquired over multiple
 generations.
 As long as one may assume that the rewards of status are passed on to the
 progeny, this view of social characteristics allows us to view their effect
 on status competitions - which develop within a particular social reference
 group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this temporal hierarchy of goods, some items that bring status are more
 temporary than others.
 Social identity is probably the most permanent of all possessions, while
 ownership of durable goods is more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 In an intertemporal substitution framework, the representative consumer,
 once having addressed her basic needs, therefore attempts to distribute
 her total (income) outlay into the three variables - needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and permanent ownership 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 does not change in her lifetime, a consumer may only be influenced by the
 characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (and not exercise her choice over it) - implying that all the consumers
 sharing the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would compete for status with both the durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 .
 Among consumers with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 competing for status, the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 also contributes to the utility.
 As social characteristics themselves may only have an epistemological value,
 we assume that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for consumers carries a direct utility proportional proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the overall possession of the social group with the characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - it being the only mechanism of how a consumer derives utility from the
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the model.
 The groups defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are therefore effectively just clusters of similar levels of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The durable goods that are inheritable items could either be transferred
 or acquired with money
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some empirical judgment may need to be exercised for short-term durable

 Therefore, the ownership of durable goods is a less permanent means of
 indicating status than acquiring or inheriting a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 .
 As we have already considered the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 - i.e.
 the wealth which someone having a social characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is expected to carry - the utility through durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is always relative to the social reference level 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 - so that the consumer utility from durable goods is proportional to (
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

) where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is measure of the group-level durable-goods possession 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - the owned possession of the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most transient of all possessions are the non-durable items.
 We have already defined a control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 as the measure of excess tracked by the consumption above needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and the costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 imposed by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 By the very definition of the needs, a consumer is meant to select an excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 only after her basic needs - internal and external - are fulfilled.
 Here, the external needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 include the maintenance costs that are imposed by ownership of durable
 goods.
 The excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) is the distance in terms of money from the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}(A)+P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 for the household - where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the long-term durable goods account, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 the social characteristics vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 the basic needs of the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 the cost of needs.
 A higher value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 would imply a longer distance in value from the needs cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 and a lower future growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (due to constraints on total income).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the model assumes no change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for the representative consumer does not mean that change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the population (e.g.
 migration etc.) cannot be explained with the model.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends indirectly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, a consumer who changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (by moving residence or being initiated into an new social group) can be
 seen as facing a new set of needs based on her new environment (and is
 not expected to carry over her habits in from the past environment).
 Therefore the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in non-durable consumption is obtained through a measure of group behaviour
 associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (for example, with the changed costs in the new neighborhood for somebody
 moves in to the neighborhood).
 Even though a does not choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, a different intertemporal substitution between the expenditure on 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is implied through different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The choice among 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is not lexicographic - since the consumers with the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would compete for status with different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the consumers with the same level of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 could compete with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 We detail the intertemporal dynamics of the choice with a direct utility
 approach - before elaborating a cost-function approach which relaxes the
 limitations imposed by the direct utility model.

\begin_layout Subsection
Intertemporal Substitution with an additive direct utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we can assume that the needs of the consumer evolve with a deterministic
 process 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 that is known to the consumer, the substitution would be limited only between
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the direct utility model.
 Given such a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, one could write the combined utility as an additive loglinear utilty in
 the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\upsilon(\rho,A,\nu,\psi) & =k_{A}log(s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A))+k_{\psi}log(\psi)+k_{\nu}log(\nu)+k_{\rho}log(\int_{\rho}A)\label{eq:loglinearutil}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A}+k_{\psi}+k_{\nu}+k_{\rho}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clear limitation of the above model is that the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A,\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 do not represent how the longer-term choices may constrain the short-term
 choices.
 More particularly, the longer-term choices are not only more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

permanent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that guard one's status - they also open possibilities of
 status-signalling through (non-durable) means (i.e.
 less permanent than the durable goods).
 A particular state or characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 of the consumer could constraint or enhance the available choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, much the way 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may constrain 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 For example, having an urban residence opens up the access to a wider market
 for status goods.
 In household-related consumption, similarly, the high prices of housing
 may encourage a consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus
 increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 However, she may improve the overall quality instead of buying a bigger
 house only until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 This implies that the consumers with lower weight for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 may compensate by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 but only as much.
 In the direct utility approach, the needs cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 includes such constraints - which fit into the temporal hierarchy of needs
 discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 as part of the commitment implied by the consumer's long-term choices.
 While the ownership of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 may imply a commitment less inescapable than 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

(since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 can be sold in the market or rented out for income), both 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 bring certain costs associated as a long-term commitments of the consumer.

\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1},\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho_{1}}A<\int_{\rho_{2}}A$
\end_inset

 or vice versa) might compete in the direct utility model.
 Recall that the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\rho})$
\end_inset

 means that someone with a group that has a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 an urbanite or someone in a privileged social class) would be believed
 to be rich - even though her real wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 might be at same level with someone with a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 a rural person or someone with an underprivileged social class).
 What permits the decomposition of utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into those through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the social observation (i.e.
 perception) of individuals in terms of identities that are established
 through long-term political or economic events.
 Thus an urbanite or someone with a privileged social class might not need
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth to indicate a higher status when compared with a rural person or
 someone from an under-privileged class who may have the same or even higher
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth.
 Yet since competitions for status matter within one's own social reference
 group and since inference of status is through social observation (perception),
 the individuals from respective social classes would continue to compare
 themselves within the same social reference group as well as those outside
 their social reference group - implying the relevance of both 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 in the common utility function

While we assume static 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the empirical analyses, the separate effects also accommodate the change
 in demand of excess as one changes their social reference group (e.g.
 by moving residence or establishing social networks outsides one's reference
 group).
 In such a case, the consumer changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has to to adjust to the higher (or lower) 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (due to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\rho)$

 The separate effects of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 also explain how the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 could dominate to such an extent that competing with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

 might not matter towards status competitions (a condition that we refer

This is not far-fetched in a developing economy.
 However, outside the developing economy contexts, if needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 expansion of family) were to be treated as part of the consumer choice,
 we may consider that an individual could delay or suspend the expansion
 of family in order to fulfill a target 
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 When faced with imminent expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 so as to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$

 distributing income between

In a typical solution of the intertemporal problem, the wealth constraint
 for the optimisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $U=u_{0}+u_{1}$
\end_inset

 would consider the final 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 all of the consumer's durable goods being liquidated and consumed in the
 last period) and the discounting rate based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - but in our case, we prefer to track the change in asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 at every period i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 (as we observe ownership of durable goods rather than wealth).
 Using a dynamic optimisation formulation, we write the following constraints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
J_{1}\equiv x_{1}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{1},A_{1})=(P_{\nu,1}\psi_{1})\nu_{1}+\Delta_{1}P_{A,1}\nonumber \\
J_{2}\equiv x_{2}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{2},A_{2})=(P_{\nu,2}\psi_{2})\nu_{2}+\Delta_{2}P_{A,2}\label{eq:J_constraints}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A,i}$
\end_inset

 is the price of durable-goods in period 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu,i}$
\end_inset

 represents the price of excess respectively (not associated with a particular
 item with quality overall).
 The above means that the consumer may consume excess values 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{3...}$
\end_inset

 being undefined) in the periods 1 and 2 while she bears the cost of the
 needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\rho,\psi_{1},A_{1}),\Psi(\rho,\psi_{2},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 (in periods 1 and 2 respectively).
 She may save for growth to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{0}+P_{A,1}\Delta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}=A_{1}+P_{A,2}\Delta_{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of consuming all her outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu_{t}\psi_{t}+\Psi_{t}(\psi_{t},A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 she can spend all of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}$
\end_inset

 (respectively) or save some of it towards 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 If we observe the states of the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0},A_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\{c_{1},c_{2}\},$

 cost of necessities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2}\}$

, the prices of excess units (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu,t}$
\end_inset

) and that of durable goods (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A,t}$
\end_inset

), then we can solve for the parameters that govern the utility function
 additive over time i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we assume that the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 grow with a fixed deterministic process 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

, the outlay to be distributed in expenditure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t},A_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in\{1,2\}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{t}=x_{t}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{t},A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:J_constraints"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 To motivate the dynamic programming approach to this solution, consider
 first what consumer's choices would be in a one-period consumption.
 Here, she could either spend her outlay as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{_{1}}=\nu_{1}\psi_{1}+\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or keep the minimum consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0,c_{1}=\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

) in the period and end up with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, then the first-order conditions would provide us the optimal condition
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Let this utility be 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*},A_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 To extend this to two periods with dynamic optimisation one can exploit
 the fact that a consumer independently optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 would always obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are positive then 
\begin_inset Formula $max(u_{1}+u_{2})\le max(u_{1})+max(u_{2})=u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is only a tool to formulate the dynamic optimisation approach - using which
 the value of utility is to be optimised over her life period in a 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

-period model (
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 being the age of the consumer).
 Thus in the optimisation of utility function in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:twoperiodoptim"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the consumer must optimise both 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 in periods 1 and 2 respectively.

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have put no restrictions on

\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu,2}$

\begin_inset Formula $k_{A,1},k_{A,2})$
\end_inset

 (other than that they should add to unity in every period).
 If we add some structure to the consumer choice by introducing life-cycle
 effects with a form of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu},k_{A}$
\end_inset

 that depends on the age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of the consumer - so the same level of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 offers less utility to the consumer as shes age (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 declines with age) and that the same level of long-term durable goods has
 higher utility later in life (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A}$
\end_inset

 increases with age).
 The first-order conditions using the Equations

\begin_layout Standard
The above solution highlights how a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may be influenced by social charactersitics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and life-cycle effects.
 An obvious implication is that higher needs suppress the total outlay for
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Also evident is that in absolute terms, the richer consumers would find
 it more expensive to indicate wealth to their surrounding.
 The equivalent argument applies for excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 There are three major limitations to the approach.
 First is that using a loglinear utility, the price derivatives of the cost-func
tion need to be the same for both subsistence and bliss (see Appendix for
 details).
 Second, the issue of constraints imposed by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 - which we've discussed above - is not sufficiently addressed with the
 additive function.
 The third and probably the most critical limitation is that we have assumed
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 to be uniform for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Since the price of excess is likely to depend on long-term characteristics
 e.g.
 wealth measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 or characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 such as residence or social class in an economy, the empirical utility
 of the model is limited.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons why the cost of excess could differ significantly
 across regions.
 One such instance is the unavailability of certain high-quality items in
 the relatively deprived regions of an economy.
 Such heterogeneity in price of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may be starker in a developing country where there are severe disparities
 amidst the consumer markets in urban and rural areas (due to structural
 issues such as high transportation costs, under-developed markets or lack
 of centralised incentives).
 The constraints on excess imposed by long-term durable goods also cause
 a heterogeneity in prices of excess.
 For example, the consumption of exotic desserts or meats cannot improve
 quality of one's food until one owns a refrigerator.
 Someone with no access to the refrigerator thus faces a different excess
 price for food than from someone who own a refrigerator.
 Thus substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is subject to constraints.
 The additive utility with a uniform 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 does not represent such constraints as it allows the consumer to readily
 substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\nu$
\end_inset

.
 To better represent the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{A,\nu\}$
\end_inset

, we look further into how prices of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 could vary for a consumer with characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
While the choice between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is not lexicographic, the relevance of reference groups and constraint
 on excess implies that it does not amount to much substitution either.
  To develop the specific conditions for this substitution, we detail the
 dependence of the price of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 on the wealth-level 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 As we have argued before, the price of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 depends on the possessions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and the reference group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - which we viewed as clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) in two ways.
 First is the direct dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 the cost of maintaining the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

).
 Second dependence is due to the constraints on excess due to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is merely a cluster of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, a consumer may not compete for status using 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 if the differences in their 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 levels (the difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band of a consumer and the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band just above hers) are too wide apart.
 Such a difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda=\int_{\rho_{1}}A-\int_{\rho_{2}}A$
\end_inset

 for levels 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho_{1}}A>>\int_{\rho_{2}}A$
\end_inset

 would limit excess for the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consequence of this particular limitation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is that the substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\{A,\rho\}$
\end_inset

 can only occur within certain bounds of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 When wide differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 cannot be overcome with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 , the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 limits the consumers' focus within their own reference group.
 This is an important claim for our model.
 While unexpressed differences in wealth may be the very cause of status
 consumption, it is also true that extremely wide differences in wealth
 or durable goods would segregate participation in status competitions across
 the groups of consumers having disparate levels of wealth.
 This is particularly true in severely unequal societies of the developing
 economies.
 Even in the more general setting, the conditions of higher cohesion (e.g.
 urban life ) that may coalesce various social groups (which would have
 had their own reference groups if not for the social cohesion brought about
 through economic changes) do not necessarily end the segmentation of status
 consumption based on wealth differences.
 For as long as wealth matters towards status and the consumers of disparate
 wealth levels participate in a common status competition, one can be assured
 that the higher wealth differences would segregate the status competitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical observations verify that the status items are tied to specific
 wealth levels - e.g.
 better food and beverages tend to indicate status at low wealth levels,
 luxury accessories at medium wealth levels and exclusive possessions (expensive
 watches, private jet access) at higher levels of wealth.
 There is evidence to the observation that the consumers with varied wealth-leve
ls often compete predominantly with those in their proximity (see Chai et
 al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Status competitions thrive because we are consciously averse to committing
 ourselves to the implications of a long-term wealth order.
 A psychological need to maintain a certain self-image and dismiss the role
 of known wealth differences to our near future necessitates the status
 consumption at varied wealth-levels.
 Thus while the differences in wealth drive the excess, it is likely to
 be segregated based on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-levels.
 The status item from someone else's 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band may not be of much value to oneself - a luxury watch may be worth
 only its sale value to someone who toils the earth for food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate how excess may be tied to differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-levels (
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

) more quantiatively, let's look at a simple example where consumers 1 and
 2 with wealth measures 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 compete for status.
 Given that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

, let's also assume at first that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=0$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 they are individuals with the same basic needs and there are no new durable
 goods to be purchased).
 With the same set of basic needs, the disposable income would be higher
 for consumer 1 since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}-\Psi(A_{1})>x_{2}-\Psi(A_{2})$
\end_inset

 (thus possibly 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}>\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 So while as such consumer 2 has higher status 1 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

, the consumer 1 might have a higher status than consumer 2 in the competition
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that we may never have 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{x-\Psi(A_{1})}{P_{\nu}},A_{1})=u(\frac{x-\Psi(A_{2})}{P_{\nu}},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 for the consumers 1 and 2 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the same utility cannot be obtained with disparate levels
 of durable goods possession - as it would imply the unlikely observation
 that the asset-poor consumer is indifferent to being asset-rich.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is possible however, that the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}-A_{1}$
\end_inset

 is so high than consumer 2 may never have a status higher than consumer
 1 i.e there may be a critical difference in wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{0}$

The market for status through excess thus exists for wealth differences

 If one could view

 as the price of items that indicate status through excess, their demand

 when there is no market for status through excess.
 Put differently,

 If we were to permit

The two-consumer example itself is not a realistic model for status competitions

The

 In a simple model with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}<A_{1}$
\end_inset

 only to make sure that 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\nu_{0},A_{0})>\upsilon(0,A_{1})$

 i.e.
 the excess required to be ahead of the higher 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$

 assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0$

 This would imply that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 corresponding to the highest band would simply be the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 set by the member of the second-highest band.

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have associated 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

\end_inset

-band, we can view the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in more detail.
 Let's consider a different example with two consumers where one owns a
 private jet while the other doesn't.
 Here, not having a private jet 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could be substituted with first-class air-travel 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 up to a certain level of wealth (bliss), but it would become the part of
 the necessity 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 as one's wealth grows - until a certain point arrives where a private jet
 must be owned.
 The first-class air-travel forms the part of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 only for someone in a lower band to compete with somebody in the private-jet-ba

 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 has a necessary break due to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands.
 We refer to this 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-break as the 
\series bold
separation condition 
\series default
which implies that a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 implies that no amount of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 may surpass the status of someone you're comparing yourself.

The separation condition - stated thus - is merely an interpretation of
 the definition of reference point in the context of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

 - so that somebody having a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 The segmentation in excess due to the differences in wealth levels 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 stated above implies a few structural properties for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 If we can assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 should rise with demand for excess, then a more evenly-spread wealth distributi
on would mean a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 than one where wealth differences are sharper.
 In a society that is more equal in terms of long-term wealth, therefore,
 the demand for excess might be more than one where wider differences in
 wealth exist (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for the discussion on how status consumption ought to be considered differently
 under wide differences in wealth).
 Similarly, a right-skewed distribution of wealth i.e.
 a population with more people in the higher income bands than in the lower,
 would mean a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A_{2})$
\end_inset

 at high levels would dominate the status consumption in the economy.
 Notice that the effect of the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is not to be ignored - as higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 reduces the disposable income for status consumption - just that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

 is immaterial for status competitions within the same

With the above details of the separation condition and relative prices structure

 The PIGLOG (Price Invariant Generalized Logarithmic
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 utility scales up linearly with the logarithm of outlay i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{log(x)-a(p)}{b(p)-a(p)}$
\end_inset

 .
 Thus the cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

 for prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{p}$
\end_inset

 could be written as:
\end_layout

 i.e.

 As long as one may assume that participants compete in a market for status

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 Equivalently, the consumer minimises her costs to obtain a certain

 While in the earlier direct utility formulation, we have detailed how the

\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for a given set of

-band-varying 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 By making 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 dependent on a certain

\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

-band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible objection to this latter formulation could be that there is no
 real competition between the wealthy and non-wealthy - as they are trivially
 far apart from one another in status.
 That can never be entirely true since there may always be a status competition
 between close-enough wealth differences.
 Also, such a competition is not fundamentally unlike the optimisation of
 consumer utilities in the presence of disparate consumer budgets.
 Thus as long as one may assume that every consumer 
\shape italic
- ceteris paribus 
\shape default
- prefers a higher wealth-level than her own and participates in the competition
 for one's perceived status, the consumer utility framework can be appropriately
 used to understand status consumption.
 Following are some key assumptions that lead to the properties of this
 model that we later use in our empirical analysis.

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 representing

As stated in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the identification of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-groups relevant to status consumption is essentially an empirical concern.
 For example, the groups based on region or social class are easier justified
 than a group based on education or native-language.
 If one were to consider overlapping characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

- e.g.
 education, income, then the classification 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands based on the cartesian product of the overlapping characteristics
 would ensure mutually exclusive 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 values.
 For example, to consider groups of graduates and non-graduates in a population
 of high-income and low-income individuals, we can consider the tuples of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{educ,inc\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $educ,inc$
\end_inset

 are the education and income levels respectively so that characteristics
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

\begin_layout Description
Assumption 2

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The subsistence level of needs does not  include ownership of long-term
 goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define subsistence level as the cost of the minimum needs basket for
 the consumer i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 denotes the price of the basket per head evaluated locally and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the number of family units.
 In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, we use a minimum needs basket comprising
 of food, energy, transport and household items categories.
 As a significant population in the developing countries survives on mere
 subsistence, the assumption that the basic needs of the consumer (i.e.
 the subsistence level) do not  include ownership of long-term goods is
 hardly far-fetched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exclusion of durable goods from subsistence and the view of excess as
 non-durable consumption in excess of one's needs together imply that the
 price of long-term durable goods cannot vary with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the way 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 does.
 This is because there is no sense of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 durable goods if the basic needs of the consumer do not include owning
 long-term durable goods.
 Once again, this does not pose an empirical issue in the developing countries
 where the ownership of long-term durable goods such as land or housing
 is limited to a small proportion of the population.

 An important feature of the direct utility model had been the substitution
 between a higher status-group and the possession of durable goods in a
 lower status group.
 While the rich live in a better neighborhood and indicate higher status
 as a group - someone not so rich amongst the rich might get more bliss
 by staying in a poorer neighborhood if she prefers to have a higher relative
 income with respect to her reference group.
 As we detail in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Substitution-with-quality"

 however, such a substitution is also subject to a separation condition.
 If the groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

 have disparate levels of needs, then all consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in$
\end_inset

group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

 would have a futile status consumption (in a competition with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

-group) as there is no amount of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 or durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that can can overcome the effect of group level wealth differences.
 Under these conditions of a perfect separation, 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in$
\end_inset

group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

 cannot move to the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

 and enjoy a lower set of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 or a more favourable 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 The status competitions would thus only exist if the separation condition
 is not met for groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$

Notice that the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 are of commodities rather than goods (we consider combined excess in food,
 quality of entertainment etc.
 and associated prices with it rather than the items).
 Of particular interest in the variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is it the effect that the unavailability of items of higher quality may
 have on 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 If higher quality items are not available in a given region, the overall
 (absolute) quality of living for the consumers in the region should be
 lower.
 However, the absolute 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

quality
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is not merely excess but comprises both of costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

 and excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 A higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which itself contributes to a higher quality of consumption.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the price of excess for a particular reference group which 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is associated with.
 The reference group in our analysis is simply the 
\begin_inset Formula $A-$
\end_inset

band.
 As the consumers within a certain band avail high quality due to availability
 of higher quality items, the face a band-specific
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 which may or may not be higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 Empirically, the quantity

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 away from the total expenditure.
 Through residence in the region with high quality items, therefore, the
 consumer typicallys raise her minimum level of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

(thus reducing the income outlay towards excess i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\psi\nu$
\end_inset

 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate the above calculation with an example, consider two consumers
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 so that the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 possesses several electrical appliances while consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 does not.
 As such 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 is likely to have a higher excess.
 This is indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 would necessarily have higher electricity bills than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 While the consumption of more energy itself does not amount to availing
 higher quality, it helps account for quality that is accompanied by having
 more durable goods.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 were to compete for status, there must be excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 that would permit 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 to get closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 in status ranking (i.e.
 the separation condition does not apply).
 The consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu$
\end_inset

 allows 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 to compete with each other for status.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 thus merely provides a way for us to standardise the competition with excess
 by allowing us to compare non-durable consumption from consumers having
 more durable goods with that from those who don't.

As with the direct utility approach, we use the assumption that the consumers

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The other less straightforward option - which does not require the consumer
 to be on a predetermined path of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 - would have been to view subsistence costs 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 (but not 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu})$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p)$
\end_inset

 remain a function of both 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 we rewrite the consumer budget as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
x_{t} & \equiv\Delta_{t}+c_{t}-\Psi(A_{t})-P_{\psi}\psi_{t}=\Delta_{t}+P_{\nu}\psi_{t}\nu_{t}\label{eq:x_t_definition}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subsistence costs therefore correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 (a zero outlay means the subsistence level expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Delta_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 due to the Assumption 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of this specification, the higher budget could either be spent
 on excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu\psi$
\end_inset

 or more long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 As the consumer acquires more durable goods her outlay could fall if the
 costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 rise.
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 by assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 must depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-levels and that the life-cycle effects are already part of the model since
 the effective outlay for excess decreases with increases in needs (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

).
 The cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,P_{\nu},\Psi,A)$
\end_inset

 is defined for i) a given distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and ii) the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 - both of which 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 must depend on.
 Before we discuss the empirical application of the model in the subsequent
 sections, we enlist a few properties of the model that we use for empirical
 analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Property 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Higher subsistence costs would suppress consumption on excess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a straightforward implication given the definition of the outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Higher subsistence prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 have the same effect as that of reducing the disposable outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 (relevant for excess) .
 It is implies also that of the two consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-groups facing different subsistence costs, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-group having the higher subsistence costs would have lower outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards status consumption.
 For a consumer closer to the subsistence level, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 would be low and a rise in subsistence costs would mean a minimal outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, a consumer further from subsistence i.e.
 with an outlay higher than subsistence level may substitute between owning
 more durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 more comfortably.
 The rise in subsistence prices for such a consumer lowers her budget for
 excess but not as much compared to a consumer who survives closer to subsistenc
e levels.
 That lowering the outlay at higher levels of the outlay does not drop the
 bliss (utility) as sharply as closer to the subsistence is evident from
 the shape of the PIGLOG curve as well (see Appendix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Property 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Status competitions are spurred as subsistence becomes cheaper and bliss
 becomes expensive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of this claim is proven trivially.
 Subsistence becoming cheaper makes sure that more consumers participate
 in the status consumption.
 With the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we can see that rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
reduce the outlay for excess as well as permanent goods and thus discourage
 status competition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we explain the spurring of status competitions in response to higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

, notice an asymmetry in the consumption at subsistence and bliss levels-
 in that while survival may not be possible below subsistence, there is
 virtually no upper limit to the level of wealth and excess that can provide
 more bliss (even if there are diminishing returns to bliss from excess
 and permanent ownership).
 The acquisition of durable goods and provision of excess can continue unabated
 as income levels rise - but they cannot fall below subsistence.
 By an intensification of status competitions we mean either or both of
 the purchases in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 not merely excess to compete with a consumer having higher 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ).
 To explain how price-rises in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) could affect the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) , let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is merely a cluster of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - so that status consumption is subject to a substitution only between
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and as well as the changes in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 As we have seen a separation condition may apply i.e.
 the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could be so far apart that and there is no need for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 status competition.
 The significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is only with respect to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is subject to the demand from consumers in a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, then consumers within the same 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band competing with excess (their needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 being the same) would drive the price for excess
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The separation implies necessarily that the substitution between permanent-owne
rship and excess is not as if every individual has a fixed demand for  excess
 which she adjusts as the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rise and fall.
 Instead, when 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is driven by finite-sized 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band alone, then a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may create more competition for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods leading to a rise in the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (and in turn narrowing the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Such a change would trickle down to the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands since the 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for the immediately lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would get more crowded because of the rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - a ripple effect that would may continue to the lowest 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The rise of prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 thus raises the price of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
 Note that the rise of prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 does not affect the higher 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

-band - so that it only limits the competition for the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band itself (as there are fewer consumers with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 to compete with them).
 On the other hand, the separation condition between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 also implies that too much of a drop in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would make the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 feasible.
 More specifically, if the rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is so much that a redistribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (wealth) ensues i.e.
 the consumers may sell their 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and move to the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, then the significant rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could lower the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 goods.
 Equivalently, when there is a small drop in price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, more consumers within the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band would stock 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 would fall.
 However, the fall in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could be so much that there would be a lot many consumers in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band and the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods would rise.
 One could say, loosely speaking, that the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lumpy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that it occurs only for big changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and is irrelevant for small changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 where it's actually the positional demand that dominates the price dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To consider the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 as the price for excess 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 changes, now consider how a rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 through introduction of new quality goods (newer technology, products etc.)
 could affect the prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Once again the price of excess increases the status of only a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
 As a newer item is introduced, all other items might not have as much value
 towards status any more and the new item - having a higher price - would
 raise the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 slightly.
 If the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands are intact, the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would drop as 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rises due to a new item.
 Here, since excess is always tied to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, a significant rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 through introduction of new items would make it worthwhile to downgrade
 or upgrade one's 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and enjoy a less intense 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that new products do not raise 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 which is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (even though it is observed at 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-level).
 Except through the budget-squeeze, the rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the cost of maintaining 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 does not intensify status competition.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The association of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 implies that the changes in price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 may never cause a redistribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now explain with the help of these dynamics how bliss becoming more
 expensive through rise of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 amounts to the intensification of status competitions.
 Specifically, as small rises of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 move together, a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for consumer above subsistence does little to end the need for status competiti
ons as long as wealth or asset hierarchies stay the same.
 Without changes that transform the asset hierarchies, we can argue that
 bliss becoming more expensive amounts to more intense status competition.

 In other words, the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 vary significantly across clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or identified 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 In the subsequent sections, we present an estimation of the model using
 the dependence of budget ratios

\end_inset

 (which are equivalent to the price-sensitivities of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(c(u,\textbf{p}))$

 and the demographic characteristics

 (which let us identify clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ).
 The above mentioned properties of the model motivate our interpretation
 of the results - which we use to explain the variation in permanent ownership
 and excess across the population of consumers.
 We believe that such a variation could provide a more relevant view of
 status consumption in the developing economies  than that of the assumed
 rush for visible goods.

Cost of Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each wave of the survey, we use both the consumption diary of food items
 and the recall diary of non-food items to compute the cost of needs of
 the consumer - summing up the expenditure on the items that are considered
 necessities.
 The necessities are gathered from the four categories of consumption identified
 in the LSMS data - food, household, energy and transport.
 The cost of basic needs is therefore simply the cost of minimal requirements
 in every category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this interpretation of basic (internal) needs, we rely on the market-prices
 available in the survey for each locality.
 For example, under food category, we obtain the minimum requires for carbohydra
tes, fat, protein and fruits-vegetables categories and the prices of the
 cheapest item in each sub-category of food.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - is calculated at the level using the prices of the
 items recorded in the survey (the prices are recorded at the district level
 as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket is a diet of
 cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - these being the cheapest items
 in most regions.
 The cost of the basket thus calculated is much higher in the urban areas
 than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 This cost of baskset is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the basic cost of needs per household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LamSmith2012Kerosene"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and https://energypedia.info/ for data on typical energy usage in the developing
 countries).
 For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 Under transport category, the public-transport costs and petrol consumption
 costs (which in turn depend on whether a consumer owns a motor-bike or
 a car) are considered not as part of basic needs but as part of the costs
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-level including the means of transport (see Table

Excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In empirical terms, excess is a measure of how far in value the consumption
 is from the local cost of reference level needs.
 For food commodities, standardising a set of needs general across the populatio
n is relatively easy - as the cost of needs in food would simply be the
 cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area for the total number
 of households in the family.
 But when the context of consumption is not limited to food and employment,
 the ideas of health and autonomy (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and Doyal-Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) require some justification based on the consumer's environment.
 In the particular context of Tanzania, the differences between urban or
 rural settings drive our consideration of subsistence costs 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

.
 The measurement error for the cost of internal needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 of the household - i.e.
 the product of the number of units in the family and observed price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 - is minimal due to the availability of market prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 at the district level in the survey and the detailed record of the members
 of the households (including their cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - which we use to measure the needs of the household).
 Notice that we observe excess not at the level of the individual but at
 the level of a group of individuals with characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (which could also be associated with an 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that all costs incurred due to maintenance, usage and upkeep of the
 long-term durable goods are included in the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and would thus bear a higher non-durable
 consumption level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical goods would not have
 the same non-durable consumption).
 Revisiting the earlier example, consider a consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 with a refrigerator and another consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 without a refrigerator who both have the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and the same set of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 .
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{E_{L}}<\Psi_{E_{H}}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{E_{L}}>c_{t}-\Psi_{E_{H}}$
\end_inset

) .
 But does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 While the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity groups
 (over energy or durable goods for example).
 Strictly speaking, the quality in one commodity can be hardly substituted
 with the quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality can be meaningful in the setting only as long
 as a total cost of basic needs level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is considered.
 The notion of excess - subject to such a level - is thus the only a way
 to assess overall quality in non-durable consumption.
 If having a refrigerator is not considered a basic need, we can say nothing
 more than that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 By avoiding counting maintenance costs under 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, we merely maintain the interpretation that quality needs to be understood
 from a reference point of needs

It is possible that ownership of some durable goods generates some rental
 income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, such income would be considered an additional stream of income rather
 than a reduction in the costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the classification of long-term durable goods is based on intergenerationa
l transfers i.e.
 an item is included in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and thus its cost of maintenance are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) only if it can be passed on through generations.
 The durable goods that cannot be passed through generations are thus not
 considered long-term and excluded from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 An empirical criterion for consideration of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is also that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 should increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (there are no assets that can be maintained without any costs).
 This criterion avoids an assets-interpretation of certain social characteristic
s such as education or club-membership - which may be acquired over a life-time,
 require some investment (fees for education or club membership) and even
 have a definite value in the market (e.g.
 employment market).
 We prevent viewing personal characteristics (e.g.
 education) as assets by limiting the constituents of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 as those that require maintenance costs to be included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

Durable goods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the durable goods in the recall diaries (see items with category
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

assets

\end_inset

 in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

), a particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey ranges from short-term
 durable items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets
 such as land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 The details of records include the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 the household expects by selling the durable good in the market at the
 time of the survey.
 We refer to the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 that the household expects by selling the durable good in the market as
 marked-to-market average or simply mtm average in the foregoing discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that as a recall value, the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 is particularly sensitive to measurement errors.
 Recorded by the survey at two different time-points spread across two years
 (let's call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs can change over the period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) may be significantly different from the cost reported in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 This could simply be because of a different member of the same household
 providing the estimate in the two different years.
 The problem could also get worsened due to two further issues - first the
 waves are not a panel-data set in the true sense - the household visited
 in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is likely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 but very unlikely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-2$
\end_inset

.
 Second - a significant number of households are split in multiple households
 - thus permitting more measurement errors as the new household members
 recall the cost of owned items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to above issues with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

, we use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods (i.e.
 the mtm average) as it is not recalled from consumer's memory but instead
 reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time - an
 issue can be handled by averaging over 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets is achieved by multiplying th number of assets
 reported with reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Around 10% of the households that were split in the periods 2010-2012 and
 in 2012-2014 have been ignored for our analyses.

Since higher cost of needs could cause the consumer to save more (intertemporal
 setting), cost of needs is used as a control variable for excess budget
 ratio.
 Consider for example a consumer whose excess and assets are known at a
 time t - so that price of needs are P_psi.
 price of A-band related excess needs to be added as the control variable.
 The price may depends on regional disparities as well as the .
 Our main goal is to check separation and the effect of regional disparities
 as well as local wealth differences on demand.

To establish that observing budget ratio
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is an measure for excess as appropriate as the amount spent towards excess
 - which the consumers compete with - let’s consider three consumers who
 are rich (with assets valued at 4,000,000), middle-income (assets valued
 at 900,000) and poor (assets valued at 10,000).
 If the maintenance costs was simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A}$
\end_inset

 (for the value of asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) we observe basic needs costs and total expenses, the excess can be calculated
 as shown in the tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and

.
 The consumer spending more on assets in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Lowwnu"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as a lower expenditure on excess and thus a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Consider now that if the rich in the example has both a higher excess and
 higher asset value then there the separation condition applies and there
 can be no competition among the consumers.
 This is the state of the status competition in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Lowwnu"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, if per-head excess of rich and poor consumers overlap
 we have less separation - as is the case in Table

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{t})$
\end_inset

 for the depedent variables 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu},w_{A}$
\end_inset

, we use the metrics that represent the relative wealth of the region where
 the consumer resides as well a variable that determines her relative position
 in the district she resides in.
 We refer to the former as the band-wealth (BW) score and the later relative-pos
ition (RP) score.
 The band-wealth score looks at the distance from the immediately higher
 band’s aggregate.
 If a consumer's 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band consistes of consumers with asset values same or less than 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 times of the consumer's wealth, the immediately higher band is marked as
 one with consumer having more than 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 times the consumer's wealth but less than 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times b$
\end_inset

 the consumer's wealth (boundary conditions imply that a 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 for consumers in the highest 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band are 0).
 The relative-position (RP) score is effectively a relative assert poverty
 metric.
 Higher RP means that the person is poorer relative to the richer neighbour.
 Evidently being rich in a predominantly rich area would result in a lower
 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 for a consumer than being poor in a rich neighbourhood.
 
\series bold
The other score looks at the wealth of the entire region in the wider economy
 (the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$

).
 
\series default
The relative importance of the two scores - which would both influence the
 quality of the consumer's consumption – are also compared in the analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of the empirical anlaysis is to understand to what the the
 separation condition has a role to play in the status consumption.
 If a poor consumer who is out of place in a rich area (thus with a high
 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 score) might compete with those with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 excess.
 If there is a separation on the other hand, this would either be futile
 or impossible

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 - thus leading to a poor significance of the 
\begin_inset Formula $RP$
\end_inset

 score.
 The BW score similarly explains if the separation may apply to the entire
 region (district) the consumer is a part of.
 Assuming the same distribution of assets, an economically poorer regions
 might see a different pattern for excess consumption than the rich region.

\begin_layout Standard
[Conclusions] If excess is lower for out-of-place consumers (with asset
 differences in the neighborhood) then there is separation.
 We find no evidence of that.
 Being in a rich area suppresses w_nu and being out of place has a positive
 effect.
 The separation is therefore limited in urban areas - more out of place
 consumers (who are more encouraged to stay within there own level) have
 a strong positive economic significance on w_nu.
 Here it is worth noting that when extremely unequal communtiies are being
 compared – the opportunities of quality would be extremely limited.
 So individual care more about their local circumstances because they really
 can’t care about quality.
 If I live in a neighborhood where the asset-neighbors are richer in compared
 to asset-neighbours in the entire country, excess is actually lower.
 It can’t be because quality is lower in the richer areas – it must be because
 demand for quality is less and individuals are spending more on assets
 – that are available in the relative rich areas (this is sensitive to how
 assets are classified).
 The main observatioin is that despite not as high A, we see higher Psi
 in the middle-A individuals – likely among urban individuals.
 Putting both together, the out of place is actually more dominant – meaning
 that competing with the rich the dominant trend – solely because of how
 the economy is structured.
 We also test with the additional metric of individual who are aware of
 the same language (we look at the ratio of people who speak English in
 the band to the total number of people in the band – this effects needs
 to be taken together with others control variables) – but social differences
 based on language do not seem significant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An issue that may be raised with the above conclusions is that the basic
 needs of the consumer may not be reliably determined with the price of
 a needs basket alone.
 To detail this issue further, consider an example where we have expenditure
 data on phones for a 1000 families and we know that the 200 of the 100
 consumers are rich, 400 are middle-income and 400 are poor.
 Assume that we also have the data on age and composition of the families.
 If we observe that some of them have much higher monthly expenditure on
 phones than others, then choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

basic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 expenditure on phone as the fees for landline, we may declare all expense
 higher than the landline costs as the excess.
 An issue could be raised by arguing that the individual’s needs are not
 down to landline costs – as a consumer might have more family members living
 away, she may be conducting occupational calls using her phone, have her
 partner living far away from her or she may be might just too talkative.
 Such effects however are always either observed in data (such as the number
 of family members, the regional effects etc.) or can be removed with differencin
g observations spread over time (e.g.
 with a fixed effects estimation).
 That is the reason why prices being observed locally is key to our analysis
 of excess.
 The notion of excess only makes sense at the level of district since the
 market-observed prices are local prices.
 National level prices cannot be used to calculate excess at local levels.
 As long as we can assume as that landline is indeed the basic expense,
 we know how the excess varies in the population without a knowledge of
 the prices of every expensive phone variety.
 It can also be said whether separation exists or not in the population
 of 1000 families, by observing if the excess could is aligned with the
 observed A-band (i.e.
 if the consumers in the poorer band P have consistently a different excess
 from those in the richer band R).
 The analysis is equivalent to the one where expenditure on particular types
 of phones is available in the survey.

WHAT DOES THAT TELL ME ABOUT STATUS CONSUMPTION IN TANZANIA? Are we talking
 about separation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, the differences in urban and rural lifestyles play a major
 role in the difference in durable good purchases as well as excess.
 This is in particular due to the availability of electricity being limited
 to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for - thus are more likely
 to deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption in an environment of uneven prices for excess consumption.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived upside risk in future wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the consumers competing with those with higher
 wealth than themselves.
 Extreme wealth differences mean a crystallisation of socio-economic differences
 and an evident separation of quality and visible consumption.

[SEPARATION THERE OR NOT THAT IS THE QUESTION]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in wealth and the segregation of quality of life in the
 developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they may be in the
 segregated societies in developed economies).
 Therefore there is a need to be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries - if the distribution of durable
 goods in the economy have not been considered.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, it cannot be denied that visible consumption is of importance
 in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption and is worth exploring in its own right - but the
 considerations of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership are
 also appropriate not only in the context of marriages but in a generalised
 context of status consumption across economies.
 Marriages - like much of visible consumption - are both an indication of
 one's social status as well as a potential for advancement in social ranking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rural and urban differences in the developing world also fit into the
 model for permanent ownership and excess that we have used in the empirical
 analyses.
 The differences in wealths and consumer's futility of status consumption
 in presence of wide differences allow us to understand how status competitions
 could work under severe inequalities.
 Standardising demand in the market for status using the model may thus
 help us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across various economies.

Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})=1$

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})=\beta_{i}(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 the Marshallian demand function).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{k}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})+\sum\beta_{i}log((x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}))\Rightarrow u=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})+log(x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}})$
\end_inset

.
 The cost function thus becomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

The PIGLOG (Price Invariant Generalized Logarithmic

 up linearly with the logarithm of outlay i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{log(x)-a(p)}{b(p)-a(p)}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A useful intuition for the PIGLOG cost-functions (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonMuellbauerAIDS"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is its view as a linear decomposition of the logarithm of outlay (
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

) into costs of subsistence (
\begin_inset Formula $u=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$
\end_inset

) and bliss (
\begin_inset Formula $u=1$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p)$
\end_inset

).
 In this form, the cost function in the Equation

 would be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
log(c(u,\textbf{p})-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}) & =(1-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}))u+(-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}))(1-u)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost-function formulation shows just how restrictive a loglinear direct
 utility function really is.
 The above direct utility form of the loglinear utility claims that the
 price derivatives of cost-functions (which are typically equated with the
 budget ratio in the econometric analysis i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial p_{i}}$
\end_inset

) are the same for both subsistence and bliss sub-utilities.
 This is a strong assumption if one were to consider status utility using
 the loglinear formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus for the consumer choice between consuming value 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 (which the consumer avails in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) and increasing asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, a general PIGLOG cost-function would allow the sensitivity of savings
 rate (choice between consuming in the current period vs saving for future)
 with respect to prices of excess and durable goods to be different at subsisten
ce and bliss levels.
 The cost-function can still be used to describe the dynamics of the model
 just equally well.
 Much the way a direct utility function under a budget constraint explains
 that a higher price makes it difficult to obtain the same utility (comprising
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{q}=\{q_{i}\}$
\end_inset

), the cost-function approach shows how a higher price causes a consumer
 to avail less utility for the same cost (
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

).

Variation in

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that if the difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 is too little, then subsistence is far too difficult (and bliss far too
 easy).
 Such conditions of a narrow difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 and low 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 are impossible in the real-world simply because while there is a threshold
 of discomfort which determines the subsistence, the possible level of bliss
 achievable with more money 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 is virtually unbounded.
 This asymmetry has implications for status consumption.
