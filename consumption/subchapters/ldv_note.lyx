\begin_layout Section*
Models for Rationed Demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A general approach to constrained demand is provided by Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEssaysDemand1981"

\end_inset

 and Lee-Pitt 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LeePittMicro1986"

\end_inset

.
 With the quantities consumed (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

) constrained due to factors outside the consumer's choice, the associated
 cost function for the rationed (or constrained) demand is matched with
 the unconstrained demand.
 The modeling of demand in such a manner uses the idea of a virtual price
 (see Rothbarth
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RothbarthVirtulPrices1941"

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

where consumer not consuming an item is due to its virtual price being higher
 than what she can afford.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarise the approach used by Deaton, let 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 be the quantity demanded of goods so that 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{1,2,3,...\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 be the quantity of the rationed good that is constrained to 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 As usual, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the total consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $x=p_{0}q_{0}+pq)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 is the utility which can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\nu(q_{0},q)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we assume separability of utility between the rationed and non-rationed
 good, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}=g_{i}^{*}(x,z,p_{0},p)=f_{i}(x-p_{0}z,p)$
\end_inset

.
 However, separability assumption is unrealistic in most situations e.g.
 if unemployment is treated as a rationed consumption of leisure.
 Status utility cannot be considered separable from non-status utility in
 a similar manner.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The unrationed and rationed problems which one can match are 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
max\ u=\nu(q_{0},q)\ s.t.\ p_{0}q_{0}+pq=x
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
max\ u=\nu(q_{0},q)\ s.t.\ p_{0}q_{0}+pq=x,\ q_{0}=z
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let the solutions of the above equations be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,p_{0},p)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{*}(x,z,p_{0},p)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 In the dual problem, the unrationed and rationed cost-functions can be
 written as 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p_{0},p)=min_{q_{0},q}\ p_{0}q_{0}+pq=x\ s.t.\ \nu(q_{0},q)\ge u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p_{0},p,z)=min_{q}\ p_{0}z+pq=x\ s.t.\ \nu(z,q)\ge u$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p_{0},p)=min_{z}\ c^{*}(u,p_{0},p,z)$
\end_inset

.
 A virtual price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}^{*}=\xi_{0}(u,z,p)$
\end_inset

 is the price at which the consumer would buy the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 of the rationed good (as if the ration weren't imposed)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Such a price must exist due to convex preferences.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 So we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z=\frac{\partial c(u,p_{0}^{*},p)}{\partial p_{0}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the above matching with a selected cost minimisation function, Deaton
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEssaysDemand1981"

\end_inset

 arrives at econometric methods to measure elasticities in a time series
 of consumption data (relating budget shares 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 with the ration 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 , prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 As we limit ourselves to the cross-sectional analysis, the effects of price
 and the cost of living index don't apply.
 On the other hand, it is worth noting that the ration 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 in Deaton's treatment
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEssaysDemand1981"

\end_inset

 appears not only through the income effect (
\begin_inset Formula $x-p_{0}z)$
\end_inset

 but also linearly as a control variable for budget shares (subject to the
 adding up and homogeneity constraints).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the inequalities of wealth and resources in the developing countries,
 we focus on the selection that occurs through lack of services - following
 the virtual price treatment above.
 In the case of energy, for example, the consumers fulfill their energy
 needs with electricity only if electricity is available in the region.
 In the case of food, a consumer would chooses expensive items (canned exotic
 fruits) or wild meat only if they are available in the local market.
 In a model of consumer choice, a buyer's inability to purchase higher-priced
 items could simply be because of severe inequalities in income in the populatio
n (a constraint that is relevant in addition to the budget constraint -
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=x$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using two equation approach outlined by Cox-Wohlgenant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 (who study the price-quality relations using regional mean prices as the
 dependent variable), Dong et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 use the following demand equations with unit value 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

 as a selection variable as well as the control variable in the main regression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
q_{i} & =\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}ln\ V_{i}+\alpha_{2}'W_{i}+\mu_{1i}\nonumber \\
 & if\!\ \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}ln\ V_{i}+\alpha_{2}'W_{i}+\mu_{1i}>0\label{eq:dong_main}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
q_{i}=0\\
if\!\ \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}ln\ V_{i}+\alpha_{2}'W_{i}+\mu_{1i} & \le0
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
ln\ V_{i} & =\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}'Z_{i}+\mu_{2i}\nonumber \\
if\  & \alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}ln\ V_{i}+\alpha_{2}'W_{i}+\mu_{1i}>0\label{eq:dong_selection}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the quantity consumed, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the unit value
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 of commodities (e.g.
 {beef, mutton, fish} in the meat group), the unit value is calculated as
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}=\frac{p\cdot q}{\sum_{j\in G}q_{j}}$
\end_inset

(see Dong et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{i},Z_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the household variables so that 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{i}$
\end_inset

 includes the household income.
 For the consumers who don't have access to electricity, the model would
 let second equation govern the zero consumption on electricity.
 We use the other respective measures of status for every category in the
 second equation (electricity availability for energy, available cars for
 transport etc.
 - see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:statusvariables"

\end_inset

) for the cross-sectional analyses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it is possible to use MLE for the two-equation model above (Equations
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dong_main"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dong_selection"

\end_inset

) and since we have a case of selection, we use the Heckman model for our
 cross section analysis.
 The selection equation in the Heckman model accounts for non-normal limiting
 of the control variables in the regression (as the OLS would be invalid
 when the dependent variable is limited) .
 Considering the case of electricity - which is available predominantly
 in the urban areas in Tanzania - we treat the access to electricity as
 the status measure as well as the selection variable (households with no
 electricity are considered to not have been 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

selected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the arguments for rationed demand, we must have the electricity
 consumption as a control variable for us to consider the effect of not
 having electricity in the estimation of the cross-sectional demand equation
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
w_{i} & =\beta_{1}log(x)+\beta_{2}W_{i}+u_{i}\ if\ s_{i}>0
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of household characteristics and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the total expenditure.
 The response to price changes being an essential part of demand analysis,
 the demand equation in the time-series i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=ln(x_{i})+\sum_{j}P_{j}+ln(x_{i}/P)$
\end_inset

 involves both the cost-of-living index and prices.
 However, both the effects disappear in the cross-section.
 Further, if the two-state budgeting assumption apply, then the rationed
 quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 with electricity being rationed to zero) is independent of group (energy)
 budget share 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 even if the rations were not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

imposed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the consumer.
 A direct result of this independence is that 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 cannot be collinear with 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in the equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though we use a model similar to the unit value as derived by Dong-Shonkwil
er, we must clarify that it's not quality that we intend to use for the
 selection criteria.
 The motivation for selection is the restriction on demand because of issues
 related to supply.
 In fact,  the quality issues are already accounted in the budget share
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 - since an item with a higher price but consumed in the same quantity would
 exhibit a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 (see the clarification by Nelson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 and the comment from Dong et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 on the methods adopted by Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"

\end_inset

 and Cox-Wohlgenant
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CoxWohlgenant1986"

\end_inset

).
 In the econometric method adopted, the variables that measure the restriction
 of demand (as a factor of status) enter into the demand equation not through
 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 (which is always positive as long as there is some consumption in the category)
 but through measures of availability - as there would be many consumers
 who completely forgo a certain parameter because of supply issue (e.g.
 meat in food, car in transport, electricity in energy etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use the Heckmann selection in STATA to achieve the solution to the simultaneo
us equations.
 The selection equation includes the factors that make restrict the dependent
 variable (consumption of the restricted commodity in our case).
 In the case of energy, we use the consumption on electricity (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{electricity}$
\end_inset

 for energy etc.).
 The consumption on electricity could be missing because of several reasons
 (e.g.
 region, income).
 A list of variables whose lack we inspect is provided in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:statusvariables"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As argued earlier, the availability of a certain item would provide a snob
 advantage to the consumer if others are not expected to achieve the same
 status in the long term.
 Thus asset ownership is the strongly tied with snob status whereas a bandwagon
 status is tied with items that are availalble in the near run.
 Availability of an item can contribute to both snob and bandwagon factors.
 It's the long-term expectation of the relative possession that differentiates
 snob from bandwagon items.
 Therefore a snob and bandwagon classification does not make sense without
 time series observation of consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a time series model, the use of assets and restricted demand models can
 give us an idea of how a consumer balances her status needs between assets
 (snob) and bandwagon items (that are achieved through high-priced purchases).
 This is based on the idea that those who have assets in the category can
 compromise on quality.
 We would initially assume the independence of categories - to see if consumers
 tend to switch to higher quality when they cannot achieve assets.
 Later, this assumption would also be relieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A question which still remains is what has the asset owner-elasticity to
 do with status.
 How is the balancing of assets (durable items) and immediate goods (high-priced
 non-durable items) as well as high-price pressure being measured through
 equations 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{hl}=\beta_{1}log(x)+\beta_{2}z+u$
\end_inset

 ? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surely, only 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{c\in\mathscr{C}}$
\end_inset

 can answer this.
 If we assume that quality is already measured through 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, then we can let snob-effects (high-price-pressure) be measured with the
 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 elasticity of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 people with higher income spend relatively higher on high-price items or
 not.
 Let's ascertain that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{energy}$
\end_inset

 indeed represents quality concerns.
 Let's assume two consumers with same 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 one buys electricity while other buys kerosene.
 Total energy consumption would be pricier for the electricity consumer
 - as long as they burn the same calories.
 Notice that we use 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{energy}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{elec\_over\_energy}$
\end_inset

 for this comparison.
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{elec\_over\_energy}$
\end_inset

 would trivially higher for the electricity user.
 For us to use 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{elec\_over\_energy}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{energy}$
\end_inset

 as a measure for quality we need to ascertain that electricity is indeed
 the high-quality.
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{energy}$
\end_inset

 avoids that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The necessary and sufficient condition for two-state budgeting is the constancy
 of the following quantity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\frac{\frac{\partial x_{G}}{\partial p_{j}}}{\frac{\partial q_{j}}{\partial x_{H}}}|_{u=const} & =\frac{\frac{\partial x_{H}}{\partial p_{i}}}{\frac{\partial q_{i}}{\partial x_{G}}}|_{u=const}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $G\ne H)$
\end_inset

 are groups of commodities and 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in G$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in H$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i},p_{j}$
\end_inset

 as prices of respective commodities, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i},q_{j}$
\end_inset

 the quantities consumed and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{G},x_{H}$
\end_inset

 the total consumption in the categories.
 In the cross-section analysis without prices, the two-state budgeting condition
s are not relevant either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we do need to indicate is still that there are no status goods per
 se.
 Instead the balance between asset ownership and high-price consumption
 can be represented into total weights (where high price consumption).
 We clearly don't have a measure of how much status consumption exists in
 societies comparatively - but we do have a test of in what form it exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-regression we should use would be a set category regressions.
 Here, we observe the income elasticities of demand for different categories.
 For us to incorporate the role of availability we separate the categories
 into rare and non-rare items a consumer would obviously have no consumption
 on items that are rare (and expensive by definition).
 Items that we deem as rare (cashew_almonds, coffee, yam, beer, honey, brews,
 pasta, pork and butter_margarine) are so only in the rural areas.
 The rare items are more expensive in the urban areas than their substitutes.
 The literature on analysis of the demand for food often uses a two-state
 budgeting model to divide demand for food into protein, carbohydrates etc.
 (or more simply meat, fruits etc.).
 In the cross-sectional analysis, this is simply decomposition into rare
 and non-rare items - so that the demand for rare items for rural areas
 is zero (it is worth reiterating that the decomposition relies only on
 the budget equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

 and not on any additional assumptions such as separability across groups).
 The splitting into rare items allows us to understand the role of supply
 issues better than what would be available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Categories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For categories other than energy, quality of food, number of rooms, a dummy
 representing possession of a car etc.
 can represent the selection.
 For energy, our two equation model is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $w_{e}=log(x)+has\_electricity$
\end_inset

 (this is the variable that ought to be truncated / unobserved)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $has\_electricity=log(x)+region$
\end_inset

 ?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If depvar_s is used in the heckmann selection, we must encode the variable
 as 0/1 - Thus - heckmann w ln_tot_exp, select( has_electricity = region
 ) - completely OK.

\begin_layout Standard
The consistent tendency to choose status consumption is effectively measured
 by whether those who give up on higher needs still look for status amidst
 what they can afford.
 In other words, if there is a status substitution that exists across commodity
 groups.
 If consumes who cannot afford housing tend to spend more snobbishly on
 food.
 When comparing developed and developing countries, we can compare this
 substitution after considering that the consumer's basket of commodities
 are entirely different between the developed and developing countries.
