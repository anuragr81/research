\begin_layout Title
Status Needs under Uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The role of inequalities and status consumption is less understood.
 Instead of considering status consumption a wasteful consumption we use
 the importance of reference point that determine snob and bandwagon consumption.
 The model looks at how disposable income after having addressed basic needs
 may be spent in mechanisms that reward upside risk or mitigate downside
 risks to understand how a consumer's risk aversion might affect her future
 wealth - given exogenous mechanisms that both reward and mitigate risks.
 The basic question - how risk -aversion affects relative wealth.

With its various interpretations, conspicuous consumption - described as
 a higher than necessary consumption of quality or quantity

 - is often viewed as visible consumption while it is less understood how
 the effect of wealth differences may coincide with visible consumption.
 We are interested in how social and occupational structures could cause
 differences in risk -aversion and reference levels - which would both affect
 a competition of relative wealth among consumers.

 that is shaped by their risk aversions.

[Advantages] We believe the subjective uncertainty and it's may provide
 a more general approach to in the developing countries where visible consumptio
n is more difficult to measure - given the varied social contexts of developing
 countries and extreme wealth differences.
 The difference in risk-seeking could be induced due to occupational structures
 and influence the equilibrium.

[Details and Side-Goals] As we ignoring the accumulation in the model, all
 consumption above needs is either risky gain or risky loss.
 If accumulation was permitted, the consumer ..
 security that be enhanced or mitigated with investments subject to a budget
 constraint, we could  consider the option of accumulation so that the consumer
 optimises her net wealth in the long-run.

The role of taxes - which we see as additional cost of upside risk is briefly
 discussed in the context of reference point.

In the intertemporal extension of the problem, we elaborate how consumer
 could spread risk across time i.e.
 become loss averse in the short-term but risk-seeking in the long-term.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products

 among the economic classes.

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

[DEFINE STATUS CONSUMPTION properly] Some of the seeming irrationality of

 Of particular interest are the developments in the behavioural sciences
 that demonstrate a remarkable descriptive significance both in the laboratory
 and in the field studies.
 Given the robust evidence in its support, we use theory of decision under
 risk to explain the observations on status consumption - a phenomenon commonly
 described as a disproportionate amount of spending on items that serve
 no other purpose than boosting one's perceived status.
 We believe that this theory could be used to explain some empirical observation
s on visible consumption.

[STATUS CONSUMPTIONS ARE NOT DETERMINISTIC and Risk-Aversion matters] Not
 all consumption are the same - both in terms of the returns they offer
 and risk they bear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate this mechanism with an example, consider three consumers with
 different occupations in a small economy that consists of an academic,
 a sportsperson and an investor - who are all of the same age, have the
 same starting wealth and share the same reference point for future wealth.
 Solely due to the nature of payoffs in their respective occupations, each
 of them may have different views on the likelihood of doubling their wealth
 in their lifetimes 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The risk-profile would vary with the consumer age when the life-cycle effects
 are considered.
 We maintain however that the differences in risk-profiles are merely consequenc
es of occupational structures rather than the individual characteristics
 of the consumer - a point further elaborated in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The sportsperson - for instance - may bear a risk-seeking behaviour in
 the short-term but might plan to be more risk-averse in the future.
 Similarly, an academic who does not expect a windfall in the short-term
 may plan to be more risk-seeking in the long-term while the risk-profile
 of the investor may lie somewhere in between.
 The consumer with different risk-aversion levels all perform a function
 in the economy and the extent to which they could compete each other is
 always limited by resource constraints.
 Further, since the risk-aversion levels depend on occupational structures,
 the subjective perception of the idiosyncratic risk in one's relative wealth
 and the long-term vs short-term contrast of consumer risk-aversions could
 justify a market for status goods providing a perceived long-term security
 to consumer.
 The academic - for instance - might wish to embrace a few characteristics
 of an aristocratic elite to experience security while the ultra-rich may
 look towards grassroots investment clubs for future wealth returns.
 If there was as it were a market for future risk-aversions, a status good
 could help a consumer become less or more risk-averse in the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The view of status consumption as merely a set of risky investments (non-durable
 consumption) in excess of one's wealth-driven needs could appear incongruous
 with how conspicuous consumption is usually viewed in the public discourse
 i.e.
 as a phenomenon that only-serves-the-rich.
 While there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst the
 rich, a conspicuous item is used both to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself and to distance oneself from the others.
 Even the poorest of the society would want to indicate to their (poor)
 reference group that they are not the poorest - much the way the richest
 may want it to be known to the others in their (rich) reference group that
 they are indeed the richest

We find that the snob-bandwagon view of consumption provides more tractability
 and descriptive significance than the mutually opposing mechanisms - pecuniary
 emulation and invidious comparison - that were identified by Veblen.
 This is because the extreme wealth differences in an economy would typically
 segregate the status consumption across social groups - thereby limiting
 the extent to which the not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation)
 or care much about the lifestyles of the ultra-rich (invidious comparison).

 Incorporating the PT utility, the choices for investments to future wealth
 are formulated as a lottery scheme enumerating the options with varying
 levels of risk.

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, our approach to status consumption is similar in many ways to
 the one adopted in many recent studies on visible consumption - as it views
 a consumer's net utility from status consumption as a combination of private
 utility (subjective) and public utility (observed through rise in wealth).
 Where it differs fundamentally is in its treatment of uncertainty - establishin
g a relationship between the risky wealth differences and consumption.
 Formulating status consumption as uncertainty associated with the future
 states of wealth and the utility from status consumption as a probabilistic
 private utility, we use a prospect theory (PT) approach to understand a
 competition for status.
 A key difference from the approaches in much of the literature on visible
 consumption is that the status utility from such consumption is not futile
 in a material sense.
 So a luxury watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared
 to its cheaper alternatives that offer the same functionality i.e.
 that of telling the current time) but if an aspiring businessman uses his
 knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business, then
 the futile consumption may probabilistically translate into a material
 advantage.
 The promise of social mobility and the security they may provide form the
 core appeal of status goods.
 Items like luxury watches are important not as much because of their intrinsic
 value but because the rich flock around them 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indeed if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile - a non-materialist sense that our model is not concerned with.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We thus argue that the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may
 offer is important to the consumer as it acts as a means of connecting
 the rich with the not-so rich in the long-term and the knowledge the consumers
 share about each other in the model constitutes status consumption.
 In the long-term, the subjective probabilities are reconciled with an observed
 wealth process - as only a few of the purchasers of luxury watches would
 improve their self-image and enhance their social networks to achieve material
 wealth - others would remain mere purchasers.

 - determine the consumer's behaviour as the two consumers compete for relative
 advantage in wealth (assets) while observing a discrete stochastic process
 of wealth.
 In this stochastic framework, status is constituted both in the consumer's
 relative wealth advantage and in her evaluation of risks associated with
 the future wealth.
 This corresponds to the conventional view of status where it is viewed
 as the high net-worth of an individual and the level of certainty associated
 with her wealth.

As the consumer evaluates her future wealth prospects observing a wealth
 process, she can allocate some amount

 to a risky evolution of future wealth.
 Whatever isn't invested as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

 is saved towards the next stage wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A(t+1)$
\end_inset

 We assume no natural depreciation of wealth in the model - so a reduction
 in wealth must come only through direct expenditure (i.e.
 consumption as part of a cost of owning assets

\end_inset

 for assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A(t)$
\end_inset

 or the investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

).
 Contrasting this with the growth and depreciation approach, the wealthier
 of the two consumers in the model cannot silently earn interest on income
 .
 Instead, she must compete with the other consumer who could acquire new
 wealth by investing with 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

 (into newer areas for example).
 To further one's wealth, the richer consumer has no choice but to bet on
 uncertain pursuits to grow her wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$

 wealth differences with respect to the other consumer but also by a subjective

 The two uncertainties only correspond to two variables

The model does not intend to identify risk-seeking or risk-averse types
 as two essential consumer archetypes.
 While a more risk-seeking individual would necessarily choose an optimal
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 different from that chosen by a risk-averse individual (depending on their
 respective risk-aversion level 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

), it would be false to claim that risk-seeking consumer would engage in
 necessarily higher status consumption.
 This is an implication which repeats the error committed in the earlier
 depreciation-growth based theories (see Loewenstein

 for a review).
 Indeed a consumer who is risk-seeking in one area could be risk-averse
 in a different area and it would be incorrect to associate a general risk-seeki
ng behaviour to a particular consumer or attribute.

Our interpretation of status is not fundamentally different from its conventiona
l view as a combination of (high) net-worth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and a high likelihood of staying rich in the long-term.
 The model merely interprets status in a stochastic setting where both risk
 and value bring utility to the participating consumers.
 The relevant features of the utility both from a normative and a descriptive
 point of view are i) the nonlinear weighting of risk and ii) the consumer's
 loss-aversion with respect to a reference point.
 Both the properties of the utility characterise the competition for status
 - which we interpret as the risk-adjusted evaluation of one's relative
 wealth advantage.

 More specifically, a given lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L$

 in the PT formulation is a sequence of payoffs 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$

 with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$

 as

 is the probability weighting function and 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(x)$

 is the payoff-utility function for the consumer.
 If we assign probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$

 to the various options

 distributed with a known distribution function to the consumer, we can
 assess the relative importance of the options to the consumer.

 The various probabilities that serve as input to the probability weighting
 function may range for example from investing in a secure cash savings
 to a balanced strategy of spending towards education (in a hope for income
 rise over years) or a bet on an expensive club membership in a hope for
 relevant social connections - all with varying levels of risk so that a
 consumer's own risk-preference always influences the selection of a particular
 lottery (and a certain

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that to understand the problems of wealth inequality, one should
 aim to understand how social-occupational structures drive risk-aversion
 levels in addition to focusing on the wealth-differences among the participants
 in an economy.

[TAXATION]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There may be a need to review the notions of status consumption â€“ which
 is often seen as wasteful â€“ in light of the perceived security they may
 provide.
 To provide a normative view of status consumption, we have attempted to
 address three key issues relating to status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[TIME DOMAIN] The opposing choices of security in the short-term vs long-term
 at the microeconomic level could correspond to the balance of cooperation
 and competition in societies at higher levels.
 This relates to the third issue - the measurable effect of taxation on
 status consumption.
 The model provides a quantitative understanding of the sustainability of
 extreme wealth differences which taxation aims to address.
 By relating taxation to the certainty of future wealth i.e.
 by considering taxation as more certain income than expenditure, we incorporate
 the insights from utility under risk to understand how status consumption
 may be transformed with taxation.
 This would also help understand the effect of social privileges on status
 consumption better - which are permanent privileges that modify behaviour.
 As the roots of uncertainty lie in exchangeability
