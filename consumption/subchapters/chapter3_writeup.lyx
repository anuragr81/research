\begin_layout Title
Status Consumption as probability of self-promotion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The role of inequalities and status consumption is less understood.
 Instead of considering status consumption a wasteful consumption we use
 the importance of reference point that determine snob and bandwagon consumption.
 The model looks at how disposable income after having addressed basic needs
 may be spent in mechanisms that reward upside risk or mitigate downside
 risks to understand how a consumer's risk aversion might affect her future
 wealth - given exogenous mechanisms that both reward and mitigate risks.
 The basic question - how risk -aversion affects relative wealth.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
With its various interpretations, conspicuous consumption - described as
 a higher than necessary consumption of quality or quantity

\end_inset

 - is often viewed as visible consumption while it is less understood how
 the effect of wealth differences may coincide with visible consumption.
 We are interested in how social and occupational structures could cause
 differences in risk -aversion and reference levels - which would both affect
 a competition of relative wealth among consumers.

 where status consumption is seen as means to offset an existing order of

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we view goods of status as items of varied risk that the consumer distributes
 in face of uncertainty.
 The consumer optimise expected wealth in this framework - an expectation
 that is shaped by their risk aversions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this model consumption is can be used either a potential risky position
 for a future jump in social ranking that encompasses status consumption
 or be invested in a slower but certain growth which offers a security in
 adverse environments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Advantages] We believe the subjective uncertainty and it's may provide
 a more general approach to in the developing countries where visible consumptio
n is more difficult to measure - given the varied social contexts of developing
 countries and extreme wealth differences.
 The difference in risk-seeking could be induced due to occupational structures
 and influence the equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Details and Side-Goals] As we ignoring the accumulation in the model, all
 consumption above needs is either risky gain or risky loss.
 If accumulation was permitted, the consumer ..
 security that be enhanced or mitigated with investments subject to a budget
 constraint, we could  consider the option of accumulation so that the consumer
 optimises her net wealth in the long-run.
 The role of taxes - which we see as additional cost of upside risk is briefly
 discussed in the context of reference point.
 In the intertemporal extension of the problem, we elaborate how consumer
 could spread risk across time i.e.
 become loss averse in the short-term but risk-seeking in the long-term.

 in his 1899 treatise titled

\end_inset

Theory of the Leisure Class
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour, Veblen sought to explore the psychological basis for consumption
 among the economic classes.
 At times his view of status consumption appears critical of a

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods
 or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order
 to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

\begin_layout Standard
Veblen's ideas have been revisited in the post-war era as the purchasing
 powers of consumers in the advanced economies have strengthened (see Galbraith
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

).
 In revival of his ideas, however, the popular discourse has often viewed
 conspicuous consumption as necessarily wasteful - whether as a behaviour
 exhibited by the ultra-rich or as a habit emulated by the poor.
 While Veblen does use pecuniary emulation and invidious comparison to explain
 consumption in the gilded age America, his observations on human behaviour
 pertaining to status consumption could be viewed more generally in light
 of the recent advances in behavioural sciences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of assuming that conspicuous consumption is limited to the rich
 and that the poor emulate unconditionally emulate them, we argue that the
 role of reference group is key to the idea of conspicuous consumption.
 Here, a conspicuous item either helps distance oneself from the others
 or provides a satisfaction of having achieved at least as much as others
 in the group - consequences that can be defined only with respect to a
 point of reference.
 In other words, the poor do not unconditionally emulate the rich but instead
 compare themselves to a particular reference point.
 There raises two important questions which we're interested in.
 First, how does this reference point come about? Second, would someone
 in a poorer position benefit from a lowered status consumption? In other
 words, when does emulating the rich start to pay off? We have attempted
 to provide normative answers to these questions using a model of consumption
 where the consumer optimises expected relative wealth relative to a reference
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevance of reference points for status consumption has recently been
 noted in the literature on status consumption.

 - for example - find that competitions within peer-income groups are a
 better predictor for visible consumption in socio-economically apart groups
 in South Africa.
 It is likely that under extreme wealth differences, the poorest of a society
 would not compete with the richest sections of the society using conspicuous
 goods and indicate status only to their (poor) reference group.
 The presence of reference groups suggest an ubiquity of status consumption
 - their relevance having increased with the expanding markets and far-reaching
 advertisement campaigns (see the commentaries from Hirsch

A broad understanding on status consumption is assisted with two classes

 - that have been used widely in studies of visible consumption - a specific
 type of status consumption.
 The visibility-based social inference models assume that status consumption
 is futile in the regular sense - an assumption that ensures the separability
 of demand for visible goods in the direct utility model.
 A majority of empirical studies on visible consumption use these models
 to explain the significant role of social identities in visible consumption

) and view status consumption as a means to alter the more stable wealth
 hierarchies.
 Following this approach to status, we use the utility under risk to explain
 how status consumption could modify a ranking of wealth.
 Two key features of this projected utility are the reference level for
 the income and the level of risk-aversion exercised by the consumer (
\begin_inset Formula $I(r,\alpha)=r$
\end_inset

).
 The projection bias inherent in consumer choice with respect to a reference
 level is described Loewenstein et al

.
 Focusing on consumption under poverty, Karelis
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KarelisPoverty2007"

\end_inset

 have also marked the importance of reference levels.
 The notion of a reference point is key to snob or bandwagon interpretation
 of consumption - if a consumer wishes to catch up to a higher reference
 she is likely to choose a bandwagon type consumption whereas if she wants
 to move herself away from her current reference she might choose a snob
 type status item.
 It follows also that the snob behaviour for a consumer with a low reference
 point could be bandwagon for another with a higher reference point.
 For example, a lawyer who sends her children for a degree in business may
 be pursuing a bandwagon consumption but a farmer who sends her children
 to in the same college the first time in generations may be exercising
 a snob behaviour.

\begin_layout Standard
Many utility function forms have addressed the role of risk-aversion in
 consumer decisions.
 While risk-aversion parameters can be used with CRRA and CARA utility functions
, the behavioural approaches have sought descriptive significance in utility
 functions (see Prelec

, Lowenstein

 Many such theories used a disappointment aversion approach such as the
 model provided by Gul

).
 Taking a similar approach, Shefrin-Thaler

 use a mental accounting approach - incorporating parameters such as willpower
 - to understand over-consumption and deviation from long-term goals.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice - where
 the consumer is subservient to her optimised plan for life-time savings
 and consumption - the representative consumer in a behavioural model can
 be subjected to overspending and acquiring habits she cannot afford (see

 to contrast with the classical treatment of habit formation and myopia
 in consumers).
 Combined with a reference point, the disappointment aversion approach leads

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of status in the model used in the current chapter uses both
 reference levels and risk -aversion levels.
 All consumers are set to optimise a private view of status - which is limited
 to a particular reference group from the wider notion of status- that latter
 being independent of how status may be perceived from within a reference
 group.
 What status means to an individual therefore differs from what it may mean
 for the group of individuals viewed at a higher level.
 While a high-status individual in one localised context is not necessarily
 of high-status in another, the notions of power and net-asset-worth are
 certainly shared across multiple contexts (societies, communities, nations
 etc.).
 More formally, in groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\{g_{i}\}_{i\in[1,m]}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i\in[1,m]}$
\end_inset

 consumers in each group 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

, each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{m}n_{i}$
\end_inset

consumers may have a private view of status, but the notion of we associate
 with each group 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

is associated most certainly with the net wealth the group has amassed.
 So while status at personal level might be subject to subjective uncertainties
 that are characteristic of the group 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 the status at higher levels is indicated primarily by the material significance
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 (that determine the reference level for the group 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard
[STATUS CONSUMPTION /STATUS DEPEND on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

] We view status consumption as a disproportionate amount of spending on
 items that serve no other purpose than boosting one's perceived status.
 The items for status consumption are thus the purchases that enhance the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

private
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 view of one's status by either increasing it or protecting it.
 The decision made for such purchases is subject to the risk-aversion of
 the consumer and the reference level pertinent to her private view of status.
 Given a reference point in monetary units, the consumer optimises a utility
 function of the distance from the reference level - which we endgonise
 using argument for log-term equilibrium in the lottery.
 Due to a private view of the future that determines status consumption,
 the uncertainty perceived by the consumer is separated from the risk in
 macroeconomic process in the model.
 This is realised with a weighted probability function - which represents
 the consumer's subjective non-linear response to the observed risk.
 The notions of subjective probability - in particular distinction between
 risk and uncertainty - have been around at least since Keynes

 The risk aversion differences represented by probability weighting function
 attempt to model the differences in occupational structures that may result
 in the different attitudes to risk (which in turn observed as a property
 of macroeconomic processes).
 In short, while risk is entailed in a random process observed by all consumers
 (regardless of their income), the consumer's uncertainty in projected utility
 is shaped by the individual characteristics that shape one's risk aversion
 and uncertainty.

In a canonical formulation, we use a Bernoulli random process

 The macroeconomic changes in an economy e.g.
 the proliferation of new occupations, onslaught of calamities, rise of
 urbanisation, economic shocks and bubbles or political risks are summarised
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $W$

 The gains and losses to an individual economy are represented as a repeated
 lottery to be played by the consumers as they observe the macroeconomic
 events simultaneously.
 The uncertain consumers must decide to position themselves to benefit from
 gains in the economy or to seek protection from any losses that the economy
 is exposed to.
 Given a disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 - which we define as the the consumer's expenditure after deducting the
 cost of her needs - a consumer can spend an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 As noted before, the total outlay

 In a more general setting, one could consider the returns from consumer's

In a real world setting, both the size of of fluctuations and the likelihood
 of return from the individual status item matter to how disposable income
 is spread between upside risk and downturn security.
 For example, with small fluctuations in the market, items of luxury (such
 as jewelry) do offer some security since they can be sold to someone else.
 But on the other hand, the owner of a luxury condominium may find poor
 return (if being able to sell at all) in a market affected by an extreme
 event.
 Similarly, the consumers may spend differently on basic education (which
 offers protection with a high probability) from higher education (which
 may offer high return with a small probability).
 That the consumers respond to an event

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between gains 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (or between 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S(x-\nu)$
\end_inset

) in the model is that social context of the consumer only affects the outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the returns 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\xi)$
\end_inset

 through her risk-aversion and eventually her social context e.g.
 of long-term occupational structures (apart from the shape of the functions
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\xi)$
\end_inset

 which are exogenous functions defining how upside risks and downside protection
 are rewarded in an economy).
 Thus even though all consumers would receive gains and incur losses equally
 in an economy through 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 (regardless of their outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 ), their fate is in their hands to some extent through 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the gains 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and protections 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\xi)$
\end_inset

.
 It is indeed the sign of a meritocratic society that upsides risks (including
 activities that set oneself apart from one's reference group) be rewarded
 and the long-term protections honoured (subject to one's monetary commitment).
 The role of social context is thus of key importance in the setup since
 that is where the notion of status as well as status-consumption lies.
 In fact one could make even a stronger claim that there would be no utility
 from status consumption if there were no perceived security or perceived
 ranking from consumption that improves one's self-image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further illustrate how risk-aversion levels could be tied with social
 structures, consider three consumers with different occupations in a small
 economy that consists of an academic, a sportsperson and an investor -
 who are all of the same age and are observed at the start of their working
 life with the same wealth endowed to them.
 Even with the same reference point, each of the consumers may have different
 views on the likelihood of doubling their wealth in their lifetimes solely
 due to the nature of payoffs in their respective occupations.
 The sportsperson - for instance - may bear a risk-seeking behaviour while
 an academic who does not expect a windfall in the short-term would be more
 risk-averse.
 Similarly, the risk-profile of the investor may lie somewhere in between.
 The consumers with different risk-aversion levels all perform a function
 in the economy and the extent to which they compete each other is limited
 by constraints of income.
 Such views are therefore shaped by social institutions over the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While risk-aversion differences correspond to occupational structures and
 extreme differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 correspond to the choice between the investments in permanent goods which
 provide a long-term security and the transient goods that improve self-image
 or social interactions without providing any security.
 Since all consumers face the same 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, the consumers can only improve their fortunes by securing more wealth
 or betting to gain more

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, our approach to status consumption is similar the those adopted
 in the studies on visible consumption -in that it views a consumer's utility
 in terms of a subjective and public component.
 Where it differs fundamentally is in the treatment status items as futile
 in the regular sense as separates items of positive image.
 So while luxury items could be seen as futile in the visible consumption
 framework when they are compared to its cheaper alternatives offering the
 same functionality (i.e.
 a luxury watch compared with a plain watch), the social utility from the
 luxury items is also related to projected future utility.
 Thus if an aspiring businessman uses his knowledge of luxury watches to
 find new clients for her business, then the futile consumption would translate
 into a material advantage (and if hardly futile).
 The promise of social mobility and the security form the core appeal of
 status goods and items such as luxury watches are important not as much
 because of their intrinsic value but because the rich flock around them
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indeed if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile - a non-materialist sense that our model is not concerned with.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We argue that the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may offer
 is important to the consumer as it acts as a means of connecting the rich
 with the not-so rich in the long-term and the knowledge the consumers share
 about each other in the model constitutes status consumption.

If the consumer were to optimise

 If the consumer were to optimise a CRRA utility

\end_inset

 on the other hand, she must choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 so that

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A+\Delta)=pu(A-\nu+\sigma(\nu))+(1-p)u(A-v)$

 Assuming a simple form for

\begin_layout Standard
Since

\end_inset

 the expected value to be optimised would 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(x,\nu))=p(P(\nu)+\chi)+(1-p)(S(x-\nu)-\phi)$
\end_inset

 For ease of notation we represent 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x,y)=px+(1-p)y$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(x,\nu))=V(\chi+P(\nu),S(x-\nu)-\phi)$

 The utility to be optimised for CRRA consumer depends would be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 the rising marginal utility for

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Theorem 1 states that CRRA for relative wealth is no different from CRRA
 for individual wealth, as a consumer with CRRA would “max-out” her

\end_inset

 for maximising the relative wealth just same way she would optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x_{1},\nu_{1})$
\end_inset

.The fundamental limitations of the CRRA utility for the purpose for status
 consumption are the absence of a common reference point for two consumers
 with different outlays 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 As we now demonstrate, relaxing the two conditions with a PT-like utility

The two key features of this competitive wealth utility are i) the nonlinear

 wealth advantage.

Unlike in the CRRA case, the presence of loss-aversion with respect to

 for relative wealth means that a consumer would be more desperate to reduce
 the distance from reference point when she is below the reference point
 than she would be increase the distance from the reference point when she

 The optimisation with respect to a reference point is equivalent to the
 optimisation of relative wealth as long as the reference point itself depends
 on the relative wealth.

who consider the extent to which the consumers are acclimatised to a reference
 point relevant to their decision.
 More specifically a consumer could choose a reference point in two schemes
 - one where the reference points are set closer to the final decision allowing
 her little or no time to acclimatise - therefore the choice of a reference
 point occurs with as much uncertainty as the final decision and the second
 where the consumer has enough time to acclimastise herself with the reference
 point.
 The former equilibria - where the consumers has had no time to acclimatise
 is called a unacclimating personal equilibrium (UPE) while the latter is
 called a choice-acclimating personal equilibrium (CPE) .
 In the former case, there may be varied reference points that result due
 to multiple UPEs.
 In such a case, a preferred personal equilibrium (PPE) is defined which
 is optimal among all UPEs.
 In the context of relative wealth and our assumption that the consumers
 observe long-term distribution of outlays 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 around them, we argue that the consumers have enough time to observe the
 reference point.
 Further, as long as there is some notion of fairness believed by the consumer
 they may compare themselves to those with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 different from theirs.

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 (which determine

 over the long-term) would determine such a reference point.
 We have possibilities of how a distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 would determine a reference point.
 The first extreme is where the consumers believe that they live in a very
 fair society in terms of their outlays, all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are distributed can be assumed to have same distribution.
 This would imply a common reference point - which would be invariant with
 respect to any developments in the macro-economy.
 The other extreme is a despondent society where the consumers choose reference
 points that are the same as their current outlay.
 This would imply that the references of the consumers are independent of
 each other (i.e.
 every consumer with a given 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 has the reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r=x$
\end_inset

).
 This second extreme leaves no scope for status consumption since every
 consumer only looks at her own income has reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the reference depends on a sense of acclimatisation over a long-time,
 then both extremes must be avoided and the relevance of

 must lie somewhere in between the two extremes i.e.
 it being neither a constant nor a function one's own

 then the  maximum expected return from an outlay

\begin_inset Formula $E_{p}(G(x,m(x))$
\end_inset

 Denoting 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x)\equiv E_{p}(G(x,m(x)))$
\end_inset

 we can view reference points are essentially a a risk-neutral view independent
 of one's 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $I(r)=E_{p}(G(r,m(r)))$

\begin_inset Formula $=E_{x}(I(x))$
\end_inset

.
 For a given a distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (over which expectation 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{x}(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is calculated), the reference point can thus be written as:

 So the expectation of

 values is not stable and the above solution does not differ a lot from
 the the separate reference points assumption (
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{1})=x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(x_{2})=x_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 For there to be a reference point, we must have stable states in the lottery.
 The assumption that the distrbution function is not changed and except
 in parameters means that all consumers were to play based on their own
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 the distribution would remain the same.
 Distribution changing

with outlays

\end_inset

 the expected outcomes 
\begin_inset Formula $I(\textbf{x})=\{I(x_{1}),I(x_{2}),...\}$
\end_inset

 would correspond to a reference point by considering expectation over

 If consumer don't

 somebody with a higher outlay.
 This averaging is what gives everyone the same reference.
 The averaging is over

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 To observe this in more detail consider the utility optimised by the consumer

The lottery maker could use the following condition (theorem) for reference
 point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
The stable reference point 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $I(r)=r$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x)$
\end_inset

 is the maximum expected income for an outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and it does not exist for an increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
A increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x)$
\end_inset

 can never stabilise.
 On the other hand, notice that extremely rich person - i.e.
 someone with very high 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 would not seek for security.
 Like someone with very low 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 would just seek security.
 A reference point resolves the consumers uncertainty of other person's
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 by taking an average over all 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 values.
 Such a resolution would be done with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of others as a decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x)$
\end_inset

 is not an increasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 (to be proven).

When all of us have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, then reference need not be 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 because the consumer don't directly observe the income of others - they
 know the reference through long-term observation - so the reference would
 also be the final state of the society if we started with the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 For the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, we would see that for a high 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 the risk-seeker gains and for a low 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 risk-averse would be poorer.
 Since we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to be constant and low in the setup, the risk-averse those with high-alpha
 would win and keep winning.
 This would create an underclass where risk-seekers become poorer and poorer.
 That's clearly not a stable lottery system.
 So the liquidity assumption must be known to the consumers as well - i.e.
 that a government would rescue them if the income falls.
 This is equivalent to a reference that represents the lottery maker's liquidity.
 If the lottery makers observes that some risk-averse people have earned
 more on average she would like to make sure the risk-averse people get
 less return successively.

 She would do all she can to get close to

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

 A risk-seeking consumer may lean towards consider 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 have higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 than the zero-reference risk-neutral consumer ) but the being too far from

\end_inset

 dominates the decision.
 When

Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Question 1
\series default
: which one of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 are more stable.
 If consumers are known to have a stable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and a stable 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 (which is the most likely scenario), then our comparisons should obtain
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 that results in the stability of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 We have only talked about stability of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

as stability of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{p}(G(x,\nu_{x}))$
\end_inset

 assuming no accumulation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is stable (given) then we need to clarify why accumulation is absent? 
\series bold
The logical problem is that if distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is known then that distribution itself should determine status - since
 it's long-term value of expected wealth that determines status.
 
\series default
The idea that a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 makes the status in a long-term higher or lower is the wrong approach -
 since the consumer would already know her status given her 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the transition probabilities.
 The idea can be explained only if we accept that i) there is no accumulation
 or the lottery is lifetime bet and that ii) the observed distribution is
 a stable state that the consumer approximates her own position with.
 Although the consumer does not compute reference points (she merely observes
 it), the reference point must be a function of time - since the structure
 of lottery would change the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 - so ultimately we might need to provide more assumptions for the accumulation
 and the lottery maker's liquidity.
 For example, we could say that that distribution is also exogenous since
 the lottery maker may be investing in something that's not open for consumer's
 to play with.
 Therefore, the distribution is not dependent on the liquidity but only
 past plays of the lottery.

\begin_layout Standard

Question 2
\series default
: is transition probability needed for 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

? In other words, Does computing 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{x}(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{p}(G(r,\nu_{r}))=E_{x}(E_{p}(G(x,\nu_{x})))$
\end_inset

 require knowing the transition probabilities of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Our claim is that consumers obtain the differences and know how the mechanism
 works, but not the long-term probability of transition- because 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 are not known for all consumers.
 Thus future is unknown but current.

: Do we need to assume that higher income would result in higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 or lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 - that richer consumers become loss averse is already implied by 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 Being loss-averse is not about having higher

Pushing

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $J(x_{1},\alpha_{1})<r<J(x_{2},\alpha_{2})$
\end_inset

 should not affect the relative position of the two consumers.
 Reducing 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for both would both result into both being more miserable.
 But it would it also change the reference point itself? Could 
\begin_inset Formula $E(I(r))=E_{x,\alpha}(J(x,a))$
\end_inset

 provide a solution? Try with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2,x=x_{0}\forall i$

 to see how reference evolves.

Consider first the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is not tied with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 at any draw 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\tau$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t=\tau+1,t=k}=J(x_{t=\tau,i=k},\alpha_{i=k})$
\end_inset

 In this case, even if the consumer becomes rich she remains risk-averse
 or risk-seeking and therefore she can only optimise subject to her own
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

Assuming

 the money that she expects give away is 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\sum_{i}^{n}P(\nu_{i})+n\xi)+(1-p)(\sum(S(x-\nu_{i})-n\phi)$
\end_inset

.
 The lottery maker is only concerned with long-term probabilities and offsets
 all risks to the consumers.
 She has no control over how risk-seeking someone is.
 If some consumers take more 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, it is offset by others using 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

, then the lottery makes should not be bothered - but it's the consumers
 whose reference point are changed as per lottery maker's average as well
 (while the differences in risk-aversion levels start to materialise).
 When some people have more money than the rest - the consumers project
 based on their own 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 what would have happened - they don't observe 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\xi)$
\end_inset

 immediately (inferring 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 indirectly).
 Lotteries have been played enough times that some risk-averse folks have
 got more 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 than them, the reference must now change.
 It's tempting to use a median but more than 50% of think that we make better
 decisions than rest of the 50% so we definitely deserve higher than the
 median.
 Our reference does depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 - namely 
\begin_inset Formula $J(x,\alpha)$
\end_inset

.
 Consider what the lottery maker collects at every time, she must distribute
 the surplus equally among all because she cannot allocate based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 (as she doesn't know which consumer has what 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 ).
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

\begin_layout Standard
The two conditions in the game are 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot P(\nu)+(1-p)S(x-\nu)+\{p\chi+(1-p)\phi\}>x$
\end_inset

 at all times for all consumers and that 
\begin_inset Formula $L'>0$
\end_inset

 at all times.
 The former condition can be easily broken if the consumer does gain enough
 relative to the reference point - recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is chosen by maximising utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x,\nu,\alpha)=w(p,\alpha)\upsilon(P(\nu)+\chi-r)+w(1-p,\alpha)\upsilon(S(x-\nu)-\phi-r)$
\end_inset

.
 In a low 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 environment the consumer who is too risk-seeking would continue to lose
 - that means the interest-condition would not be met for her.
 The lottery maker cannot control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 nor can she allocate anything based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 - all what she can do is to ascertain that the risk-seeking consumer does
 not take too much risk - in another words adjust provide more security
 (to incentivise risk-aversion).
 For setting one value for the entire game she would need to choose 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 that considers this possibility.
 Notice that too much risk-aversion in the low 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 environment could also be problematic for the lottery maker because that
 would mean just security investments and too much cash - which is not lottery
 makers intention.
 Since the lottery maker does not observe 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 - she can only ensure that the outliers are not that many i.e.
 the difference in risk-aversion does not cause the income differences so
 much that the reference points makes the lottery worthless.
 She therefore sets up 
\begin_inset Formula $P,S$
\end_inset

 so that outliers are limited or indeed zero.
 The lottery maker only needs to check the sums 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}=\sum_{i}^{n}P(\nu_{i})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}=\sum_{i}^{n}S(\xi_{i})$
\end_inset

 to see which side is dominates.
 The question is easily answered if we consider how lottery maker balance
 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 accounts to begin with.
 She cannot afford to keep it anything else but align it with 
\begin_inset Formula $L=p\chi-(1-p)\phi$
\end_inset

.
 The next argument must be made to justify why lottery-maker's amount becomes
 the reference point.
 But considering the primeval problem, how exactly must the lottery maker
 balance her game.
 The truth is the lottery maker is also taking a bet - and she must maximise
 her returns - but in our cases, this a particularly benign lottery maker
 who steps in only to motivate the participants.
 Consider what would happen if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}=0$
\end_inset

 in a low 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 environment i.e.
 all consumers want upside risks.
 The lottery maker is fine as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P<}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $nL$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the amount to be paid back does not exceed here expected amount.
 Similarly, she must also ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}<L$
\end_inset

.
 Combining both arguments we can say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{P-S}<nL$
\end_inset

.
 To double check, consider what would happen if nobody had any income 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)=S(\xi)=0$
\end_inset

.
 The consumers would not be interested in playing the lottery and the 
\begin_inset Formula $nL$
\end_inset

 would be distributed among all participants everytime.
 Except in these dictatorial conditions when 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\xi)>0$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\mathscr{P)+}E(\mathscr{S})<nL$
\end_inset

 so that the lottery maker can stay liquid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two problems that we have noticed yet:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The lottery maker does not generate money or receive it from another source
 - she has a starting amount and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu)$
\end_inset

 does not generate money but increases the allocation by lottery maker -
 who does nothing more than collected all the money as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\nu$
\end_inset

 and bets it in nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We have assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 are natural constants - they are also to be set by the lottery maker if
 she has no source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next conditions is that 
\begin_inset Formula $J(x,\alpha)>x$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for which the lottery maker must also make sure that 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mathscr{P-\text{\ensuremath{\mathscr{S}} }|}$
\end_inset

 is not above a certain threshold.
 If it is above that threshold, the consumers would drop out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering what would happen with a difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 while the initial income is the same.

Conclusions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that to understand the problems of wealth inequality, one should
 aim to understand how social-occupational structures drive risk-aversion
 levels in addition to focusing on the wealth-differences among the participants
 in an economy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[LIMITATION] The limitation of the model is that 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is not a probabilistic functiojn of 
\begin_inset Formula $nu$
\end_inset

 - in reality the retuns themselves are risky.
 i.e.
 within the consumption of items that only reward upsides risk, not all
 option to the consumer offer the same return.
 A club membership offers low probability high returns and education offers
 more guaranteed but low returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[TAXATION] considering taxation as more certain income than expenditure,
 we incorporate the insights from utility under risk to understand how status
 consumption may be transformed with taxation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[MULTIPLE REFPOINTS] Multiple refpoints may offer a better picture of reference
 points.
 We have assumed that reference points are the same only to illustrate the
 effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 caused by occupational structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[TIME DOMAIN] The opposing choices of security in the short-term vs long-term
 at the microeconomic level could correspond to the balance of cooperation
 and competition in societies at higher levels.
 This relates to the third issue - the measurable effect of taxation on
 status consumption.
 The model provides a quantitative understanding of the sustainability of
 extreme wealth differences which taxation aims to address.
 This would also help understand the effect of social privileges on status
 consumption better - which are permanent privileges that modify behaviour.
 As the roots of uncertainty lie in exchangeability
