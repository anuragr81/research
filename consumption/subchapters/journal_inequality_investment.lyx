\begin_layout Abstract
Status motivations for consumption have generated an immense interest at
 a time when social mobility has been relatively stagnant - but the consequences
 of inequality within societies on patterns of development are still poorly
 understood.
 To examine the relation between inequality and investments relevant for
 status improvements, the current paper considers an economy with a hierarchy
 of positions that consumers are able to move between.
 The paper elaborates how relative incomes associated with each position
 within this setting influence the agents’ saving, consumption and labour
 supply decisions.
 With greater effort improving one’s chances of moving to a higher position,
 two competing forces arise.
 On one hand, the inequality in incomes associated with different positions
 motivates striving for a high position holding the chance of winning that
 position fixed.
 But on the other hand, ensuring that the probabilities of moving up and
 moving down are equal across the society reveals that these positional
 contests can become uncompetitive.
 Greater inequality tends to lower the chances that striving effort pays
 off.
 The paper explores the resulting non-linear relationship between inequality
 and steady state production.

\begin_layout Standard
Status motivations for consumption have concerned economists since at least
 as far back as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 .
 The interest in positional concerns seems to have been renewed in the post-war
 period of relative stability and improvement in life-standards (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,FrankModel,FrankPond"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Despite this revival, there remains a disconnect between the behavioural
 theories explaining effects of social environments and the theories of
 economic growth (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KayRadicalUncertainty2020,SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"

).
 While positional competition seems ubiquitous, the inquiries into how consumer
 behaviours evolve under economic inequality or contribute to growth are
 rare (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KnellInequalityStatusGrowth1999,HopkinsStatusInequalityGrowth2004,CorneoStatusGrowth2001"

\end_inset

 for recent approaches to the problem).
 To examine this issue, we focus on investments that may contribute to future
 economic success as well as social position - and ask whether such investments
 should increase or decrease with a rise in income inequality.
 In the particular context of growing economies, we also clarify if income
 inequality should in turn contribute to wealth accumulations in the long-term.

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the literature we have surveyed so far, the views on whether inequality
 has a negative or positive effect on positional consumption are contrasting.
 On one hand, it is argued that fall in income inequalities (combined with
 improvements in life-standards) has resulted in a higher focus
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It may be worth remarking that the sociological observations of increased
 status needs in response to falling inequality in the post-war era often
 constitute normative rather than descriptive arguments.
 Therefore, it need not follow from such observations that consumers feel
 a higher need for status as the inequality rises (or vice versa) - only
 that the avenues for indicating status may decline as the life-standards
 become uniform with decrease in income inequality (

 on positional competition and the related consumption (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithAffluent,GalbraithBeyondContentment1994,GalbraithEssential"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) but on the other hand, the empirical literature also finds that such consumpti
on ends up increasing with rise in inequality.
 In the particular context of developing economies, such consumption (e.g.
 education) is reported to increase with rising inequality (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JinLiInequalityStatusConsumption2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 A causal relationship between inequality and consumption for status remains
 elusive since both the growth environment and the social context of the
 economy create an evident omitted variable bias (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011,MinkoffLyonsIncomePerceptionsUnderIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In a stylised model for positional competition with a fixed reward mechanism
 for the winner, the paper argues that while consumers may increase status-relat
ed consumption in the short-term, they are compelled to withdraw from status
 competitions when subjected to rise in equality under constraints of population.

The paper also comments on the effect of inequality on long-term asset accumulat
ions through such investments.
 The effect of investments towards future positional status (such as education)
 on long-term consumer accumulations could be relevant for the much debated
 issue of whether economic growth is influenced by inequality or not (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ForbesReassessmentInequalityGrowth2000"

).
 The results from the stylised model highlight how a rise in economic inequality
 could cause a decline in consumer accumulations (for the poor as well as
 the rich) if all consumers participate in positional competitions.

%[Brief description of the model]
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth stating that the investments we focus on in the paper are different
 from the concerns of visible consumption in the literature.
 The status goals of the consumer are equated with her economic goals -
 so that status is merely the consumer's expected secure wealth in the model.
 A contest-theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tullock1967"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) view of positional competitions that we adopt in the paper eventually
 relies on observations first made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HarrodGrowth1958"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that social mobility and status are limited due to necessarily finite positions
 for high status.
 The positional competitions in the model are represented as uncertain transitio
ns to a richer or poorer income bands - with a probability influenced by
 the consumer's investments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution for the model based on a specific set of functions for mobility
 across income bands is based on two conditions.
 The first condition is that of population stability - i.e.
 the long-term stability of sub-populations within income bands - ensuring
 that the number of consumers leaving a band is balanced with the number
 entering the band.
 The second condition is that of an ordering of utilities for richer and
 poorer consumer in a society.
 Since the recurrent bands (nodes) in the model are the poorest and the
 richest bands, a particular ordering of utilities from wealth representing
 how rich and poor consumers achieve a cooperative equilibrium allows us
 to explain how a consumer may balance the accumulation of her wealth at
 risk with maintenance of a fair chance to improve (or hold) her socioeconomic
 position.
 The solution is then used to suggest implications of rising income equality
 for the steady state levels of investments
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is worth remarking that while the game does permit a zero investment
 by either of the consumers (i.e.
 a withdrawal from the status competition), a non-zero investment for both
 the consumers means that the rich consumer must not find the investment
 for promotion - that the poorer consumer is offered a chance to be rich
 with - to be too little and the poorer consumer must not find that there
 is nothing on offer for mobility through status competitions to the richer
 position.
 In other words, the zero-consumption from either of the consumer does not
 constitute an equilibrium where both poor and rich consumers participate
 in the status competition.

\bar under
In the context of 
\bar default
positional competition in growing economies where expenditures such as education
 are of material significance and a fixed scheme of rewards to investments
 can be assumed, one of the implications of long-term equilibrium is that
 the the poorer consumer's positional investments need not decline with
 narrowing of income differences in the long-term.
 Equivalently, the costs to maintain the high accumulation for the richer
 consumer may rise with narrowing of income differences in the long-term.
 These seem to fit with the recent observations of rising aspirational consumpti
on in the developing economies and the tighter competitions for wealth in
 the developed economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to evidence of a certain myopia in consumption (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "false"

\end_inset

), one is more often concerned with the consumer motivations in the short-term.
 The implication of the long-term equilibrium - however - are different
 from the short-term implications - since the wider income differences may
 not intensify positional competitions for the long-term equilibrium as
 they do in the short-term.
 Thus a consumer may strive for more mobility in the short-term as income
 differences rise, but if the long-equilibrium were to move from a low-income
 differences (income inequality) setting to a higher income-differences
 setting, it is possible that poor consumer withdraws from the positional
 competition (zero status investment).
 The long-term equilibrium conditions of population stability imply a dynamics
 where wider income differences may act to reduce positional investment
 by making band-promotion more difficult (for the poor consumers) and band-secur
ity cheaper (for the richer consumers).
 Similarly, a narrowing of income-differences in the long-term increases
 the value of (utility from) the expenditure towards status for poorer consumers
 - so that the poorer consumers spend less on status investments while the
 richer consumers raise their expenditure towards status to maintain their
 position of wealth in the long-term.
 Inequality can thus have a separating effect of pushing investments away
 from each other in the long-term and eventually discouraging positional
 investments.
 Further, the asset accumulation can either decline or rise with inequality
 depending on the transition functions - so long as the population stability
 criterion is maintained.

%[Advantages of our approach]
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that the contest-theory approach presented in paper is more relevant
 to status-related consumption in growing economics where the effect of
 investments such as education is more prominent than that on visible goods.
 Unlike visible consumption, such expenditures provide a real (albeit uncertain)
 opportunity for gain in positional status (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SnowerBosworthIdentityDrivenCooperationCompetition2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 The current approach also benefits from fewer assumptions on savings behaviour
 of the consumer (such as a constant savings rate) and the steady state
 of growth (such as a knowledge spill-over assumption in

 the implications of the widening of income differences on competitions
 that are implied in the short-term.

% Associating the matching process from Cole-Maliath  with a transition
 in income bands, we also account for the poorer consumer having a propensity
 to remain within her income band due to the localised notions of status.
 This is permitted by letting the consumer with lower assets in a poorer
 band have a higher utility than she would for the same level of assets
 in a richer band.

The empirical approaches to status have benefited immensely from studies
 in psychology of early 20th century (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "roperclassifyingresp1940,HymanStatuPsych1942"

\end_inset

).
 Some key modern behavioural approaches - such as use of reference points
 (

LatexCommand cite
key "MarkowitzUtil1952,RuncimanRelativeDeprivationSocialJustice1966,KahnemanTversykPT1979"

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RuncimanRelativeDeprivationSocialJustice1966,MarkowitzUtil1952"

).
 Recent approaches continue to incorporate ideas from psychology - such
 as self-esteem and self-identification - for an understanding of positional
 competition in the economy (

 breakthrough in recent behavioural approaches (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 functions - chosen to facilitate consideration of implications of long-term
 constraints (such as population or finiteness of resources) - to explain
 the effects of income differences on positional competitions.

The stylised model banks upon the contest theory approaches based on a sequentia
l rent-seeking problem that was first formulated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tullock1967"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since its formulation, the Tullock competition has been used to understand
 contests for wealth, prestige or any position where chances of winning
 are affected by the investment of the players (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TullockEfficientRentSeeking2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Despite a similarity with Tullock competition, there are some key differences
 between our approach and the Tullock competition that are worth highlighting.
 First, while the status game in our model is also a full information game
 (much like a Tullock competition), our approach is more concerned with
 the implications of a long-term equilibrium than the sequential setting
 that is at the heart of a Tullock contest.
 Second, instead of operating as Tullock's bidding competition, our model
 uses a logistic probability function for transition across income bands.
 The probability function used in Tullock contest - on the other hand -
 is necessitated by its unique setting (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kooremanTullockProbability1997"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the goal of conditions on feasibility of transitio
n probability is also address to the issue of dissipation - the total invested
 resources in the rent-seeking game being less than the total rents - an
 issue (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CorcoranLTETullock1984,hillmanrisk1984"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) that is not considered in the original Tullock contest (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tullock1967"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In other words, a limitation of the original Tullock competition is that
 it does not guarantee the total rent to be lower than the total resources
 invested in rent-seeking.
 A useful extension is offered by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "michaelsdesignrentseeking1988"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 by considering an external agent who profits from selling input to the
 rent-seeking contest.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "michaelsdesignrentseeking1988"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 thus address the issue of dissipation by setting the parameters of the
 Tullock contest so that the profit for the external agent in the setup
 is maximised.
 We address this issue in the model through long-term equilibrium conditions
 for the particular status promotion probability function.
 A cooperative solution explored in the paper also relies on an external
 planner - similar to the external agent setup used by

Apart from explaining the effect of inequality on investments towards positional

As we do not

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here it is worth noting that while the prominent view remains that status
 consumption has a negative impact on economic growth, the literature notes
 several reasons why status consumption may not always affect growth negatively.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 emphasise the context of upward comparisons (i.e.
 comparisons with those with higher or same income as one's own reference
 income) in their finding of a negative effect of status consumption on
 growth in the developed economies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 ).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 argue that the positive effects of inequality on growth hinge upon how
 the society treats its lowest individuals.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CONGLETONStatusGames1989175"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 make the more general argument in saying that some status games being more
 productive than others could lead to institutional arrangements that promote
 “benign” status games and growth.
 Our approach in the paper has been to focus on the disparity in economic
 opportunities and the time-horizon for savings decisions pertaining to
 positional competitions - which we view as a possible mechanism driving
 economic growth.

Empirical studies for effects of inequality on growth have also emphasised

 While the inter-relationship between growth and inequality remains an intensely

 on consumer behaviour in positional competition is worth attention so long
 as positional consumption can be argued to have an effect on economic growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting also that our specific consideration of status
 - an approach that equate the social goals of the consumer with her long-term
 economic goals - bears more similarity with the approach followed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The context of our model is thus one where status related efforts contribute

 improve their future wealth.
 To investigate the effect of inequality, we focus on how higher income
 differences may increase the investment towards status when there are two
 particular constraints for the game in the long term - namely the population
 constraint and a particular ordering of utilities from assets for the richer
 and poorer consumers.

\begin_layout Standard
The hierarchy of positions in the model is represented as a set of bands
 with a representative consumer.
 Thus, the mere belonging to one of the bands implies a particular disposable
 income to the consumer.
 Further, if the consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 obtain a disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in any given period, then the choice faced by the consumer is to either
 i) save for a gain the utility from assets while staying in her current
 income band or ii) spend a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 out of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 while staying in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to participate in a the competition that may promote her to a higher income
 band with a certain probability depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 or demote her to a band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a certain probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 We assume no credit line towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 so that a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 with expenditure towards status
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{k}$
\end_inset

 always has 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{k}\le y_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the income bands range from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in an economy so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}<y_{k+1}\forall k\in[1,n-1]$
\end_inset

, we associate a probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 with the promotion of a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to the next income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is not defined for the highest band 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer could also be demoted to an immediate lower income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the lowest band 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected utility from the future assets in the respective
 income bands she may be in the future.
 The incomes are distinguished based solely upon rewards of competitions
 i.e.
 the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1...n}$
\end_inset

 that are provided in the respective income band (the disposable income
 excludes the cost of a consumer's needs and is the same for all consumers
 in a particular asset-band).
 The assumption is summarised as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:def_band"

\end_inset

The incomes bands are characterised only by the levels of disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every consumer strives to achieve the highest assets in the economy.
 Since the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every band can be used to accumulate towards assets under risk of loss
 or participate in tournaments of unobserved ability, the wealth differences
 among consumers in this economy arise only due to their outcome of the
 promotions or demotions over time.
 These promotions or demotions are what represent the position competition
 in the model that may arise due to institutional arrangements granting
 some mobility across income bands while not completely getting rid of the
 stratification that limits participation.
 In other words, the success in these positional competitions serves simultaneou
sly as both an evidence of ability and a barrier to entry.
 Since we treat economic and social status as the same, the notion of status
 (or ability) is relevant only through probabilistic monetary success in
 the long-term that is revealed to the consumer only through positional
 competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is evident that differences in income across bands makes the the competition
 biased in favour of the higher income band, so that more expenditure towards
 status increases the probability of one's successes in the competitions
 through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and decreases that of failure 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is defined so that a consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is rewarded more often and so that no amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can ever provide guarantee to be in the next band (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also assume that the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 have the same structure across income bands i.e.
 their dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 varies only in parameters that vary across bands 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 A lower band (e.g.
 a poorer underlcass in an economy or a poorer country in the global economy)
 may thus have a lower base-level expenditure towards status (e.g.
 mean) but the outperformers in a poor environment are expected to improve
 their fortunes through the same mechanism that a consumer in a higher-income
 band would.
 This is a fundamental assumption for the positional competitions in the
 model that determines the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and

The mechanism for the competitions are fundamentally the same across all

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the consumers of varying characteristics (age, skills, talent etc.)
 observe the same likelihood of promotion to the next band as long as they
 are in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 for band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 offer exactly the same probability to all the consumers in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, we consider only one representative per band for further analyses.
 Also, since the positional competition in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 to be promoted to band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are not open to any consumers in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that is lower than the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

, it follows that for a consumer to be in a band higher than the next she
 must go through the next band.
 A consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can reach to another band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 only by going through bands 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1,...,j-1$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, a Markovian property is implied for the consumer's future
 utility from assets.
 In other words, the future utility at any point that the consumers maximise
 with the income received in their income band is by either staying in the
 same band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or having moved to any of the bands different from their own.

The above set up for the competition implies a short-term equilibrium as
 consumers maximise the total accumulated assets in their band-reference
 within a given (finite) period of time.
 While the assets to be maximised are may be at risk of loss in the long-term,
 the short-term optimisation must be unaware of the assets being lost in
 the short-term finite horizon.
 Further, the chain relevant for our discussion would have two recurrent
 states - allowing us to focus on an economy of a rich band and a poor band
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Without loss of generality, we consider the equilibrium when the consumers
 in the economy comprising of a poor band 1 and a rich band 2 maximise the
 assets accumulated in a single (finite) period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice first that the consumer in the two-band economy can either be demoted
 or promoted over time and her expected future wealth would be the expected
 sum of incomes from the future bands she can be in over the finite time-horizon.
 In the Markov chain implied in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the future state of the consumer is thus based on either of the future
 bands she could be in with the respective probabilities associated with
 the transition i.e.
 the consumer in band 1 could expect to have either 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 income in the next period with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $1-W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 In the period after next, she could be in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}$

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and so on in further periods.
 Similarly, the consumer in band 2 could be in band 1 or 2 in the next period
 with the respective probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and so on.

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the optimisation of expected utility over a (finite) two-periods,
 the representative consumer in the two-bands economy has - as it were -
 just one life and the one-shot-investment for her life-time status as she
 maximises the utility from assets under no risk.
 The probability functions associated with the promotion and demotion 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 respectively are shown in Figure

\end_inset

.
 In the short-term finite horizon equilibrium, the representative consumer
 must maximise the assets at the end of the first time-horizon.
 It being a finite time-horizon, the consumer is not expected to spend on
 expenditure towards status at the end of her life.
 Thus, as is common in the applications of the life-cycle model (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the finite-time horizon optimisation means that the consumer isn't concerned
 with the life after the time-horizon.
 In other words, the short-term equilibrium requires that the consumer does
 not worry about her poorer or richer future state expect for the final
 assets at the end of time finite time-horizon.
 We thus set the expenditure towards status 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the last period as zero for all the consumers regardless of the value
 of assets they have amassed.

 A change

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of our discussion on long-term conditions, we continue
 to use the simplified chain with only two income bands which the consumers
 can transition in between.
 The fundamental condition for long-term stability that we impose is that
 of the stability of income band populations.
 More specifically, the number of consumers who leave an income band in
 the long-run must be balanced by those entering the income band in the
 long-term.
 The essential claim that is inherent is that the consumers expectations
 are rational and are not detached from the population constraint.
 An equilibrium with long-term income inequalities thus cannot exist if
 not for such a population preserving status competition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the long-term status competitions with a population preserving
 mechanism - are equivalent to a scheme where an equal number of consumers
 are selected in successive bands and swapped with each other at a certain
 cost (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 With such a swapping mechanism, if

\end_inset

 represents the probability of a consumer moving from band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$

 (not defined for

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the long-term income inequalities without any
 redistribution (or a status competition defined as above) cannot provide
 a stable long-term equilibrium for asset values.
 More specifically, if we rule out any institutions of direct redistribution
 of income, the accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=\sum_{t}^{T}\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the disposable income for the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}=y_{i}\forall t$
\end_inset

 ) - would lead to divergent differences in accumulated wealth - unless
 there is a risk of loss associated with the accumulation of wealth so that
 accumulations remain bounded.
 As shown in Appendix II, no redistribution or status competition can allow
 for a long-term equilibrium of asset values in the above economy with unequal
 incomes.
 When assets accumulated are under risk (for both rich and poor consumers),
 a stable steady state can be easily achieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key assumption for the long-term equilibrium is that that the functions
 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 - which the consumer considers for accumulation - change exactly at the
 horizon relevant for the loss of accumulated assets.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above assumption allows us to consider an independent stochastic variable
 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$

 for both the consumers.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}=1$

 resets the

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}A_{2}$

 A peer effect kicks in some sense - due to the fact that the richer consumer
 absorbs (replicates) the choice made by poorer consumers as she is demoted
 to band 1 and thus the choice of the poorer band is also factored into
 her choice in the starting period.

The selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 rests upon two properties that we have briefly discussed.
 First, the status competitions can never guarantee a reward to the next
 band i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $\nexists\nu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)=1$
\end_inset

.
 Second, that any consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 should be rewarded with a higher probability than a consumer with a lower
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\nu_{1}>\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{1})>W(\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu_{1})<L(\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\nu_{1}>\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these specifications, we assume a logistic form for 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{1})$
\end_inset

 as a general formulation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
W(\nu) & =\frac{1}{1+e^{-\omega(\nu-\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}})}}\label{eq:particular_W_nu_definition}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above specification only considers 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial W}{\partial\nu}$
\end_inset

 is symmetrical around 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the probability to rise to the next band rises and drops at the same rate
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 The same applies to the equivalent definition for 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 When considering the population stability in band, the above specification
 translates into a simple linear relationship between the parameters that
 we discuss below.
 While a 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial W}{\partial\nu}$
\end_inset

 that is asymmetrical around 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 may provide a more general specification of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

, the results that we derive from the specification are independent of whether
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial W}{\partial\nu}$
\end_inset

 is symmetrical around 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 around or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are certain implications of the parameters for the nature of status
 competitions.
 First, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 determines how sharp the probability of promotion 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 would rise with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 The plots of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 defined in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

 are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:W_nu_parameters"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

, on the other hand, represents whether a significant rise in probability
 occurs for a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}$
\end_inset

) or relatively low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}$
\end_inset

).
 Roughly speaking, with 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 being the upward mobility in the two-consumer economy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is the degree of separation in bands imposed by the spending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 A high 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 differentiates the outcome of those having low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from those having higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 more clearly.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}$
\end_inset

- on the other hand - is the minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for there to be a probability of transition to the next income band.
 It thus represents the level of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 at which status competitions become significant in the economy.
 We focus on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

 implied by long-term equilibria - since a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

 means a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 required for mobility and a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

 means low mobility.

\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$

While an explicit solution of the first-order conditions for the above may

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$

 Also, an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$

\begin_layout Standard
As we now show, the increases in 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are balanced by long-term consequences of population stability conditions.
 Such a long-term solution which accommodates the population stability can
 be assumed to imply a planner that directs the various selections 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\bar{\nu}_{1},\bar{\nu}_{2}\}$
\end_inset

 implied by the above optimisation of above utilities.
 In other words, a combined utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 for both the consumers can be assumed to be maximised while the population
 stability conditions are implied.
 To explore a detailed numerical solution of the equilibrium, we therefore
 focus on a cooperative solution using a combined utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 for both the consumers.

The cooperative approach that we explain the effect of income differences

Another way to interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*}=\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}-\kappa(\nu_{2}^{*}-\underbar{\ensuremath{\lambda}})$
\end_inset

 is that the poorer consumer's long-term expenditure towards status rises
 with the level at which upward transition becomes significant and falls
 with richer consumer's excessive spending.
 It is worth noting that the population stability condition is

independent of any consumer utilities that the consumers use to make choices
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 or whether one views the cooperative or Nash equilibrium as solutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The level at which upward transition becomes significant raises poor consumer's
 expenditure towards status is less surprising.
 What's more interesting is the withdrawal of the poorer consumer from the
 status competition due to a higher status investment  by the richer consumer.
 The population constraint - under the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa>1$
\end_inset

 - readily provides the condition of withdrawal from status competitions
 for either of the consumers in the economy.
 More particularly, there would be no benefits to the consumer from expenditure
 towards status when either 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 is implied in the long-term.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are known in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\underbar{\ensuremath{\lambda}}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 are already known and fixed) for given utilities, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}{\kappa}+\overline{\lambda}=\overline{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 sets the 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 for a given level of security 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 that must exist for there to be a status competition with non-zero 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, for consumer 1 to participate in the status competition,
 the consumer 2 must choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}<\frac{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}{\kappa}+\text{\underbar{\lambda}}$
\end_inset

 .
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

 implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\kappa\underline{\lambda}+\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 if the consumer 1 spends more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa\underline{\lambda}+\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

, the likelihood of her getting into the richer band is so high relative
 to the security offered to the consumer 2 through status competition that
 there would be no reason for any expenditure towards status for the richer
 consumer.
 Notice that these constraints indeed uphold for any utility maximised by
 the consumer.
 To explore the effect of income differences 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$

 on the selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 by the poor and rich consumers, we now explore a cooperative solution numerical
ly for a given

 the two consumers are considered.

 This combined utility for the two consumers can be viewed as the Pareto-goal

 A parameter

 is used in this combined utility to controls for whether the Pareto goal
 relies more on the richer consumer than the poorer consumer.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 could indicate how labour-intensive an economy may be or how segregated
 (in terms of the population) the rich and the poor are in the economy.
 For the purposes of our discussion, it suffices that a given long-term

\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

 Finiteness constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}^{*}+\bar{\nu}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 therefore suppress the status investments for the poorer consumer.
 Further, as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

 is an increasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 increasing income difference between the two consumers always increases
 the constraint

\begin_inset Formula $\omega>\lambda$
\end_inset

 would mean that an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$

 would decrease 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$

 and a decrease in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$

 Considering a specific form for

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial\bar{\nu}_{1}}=0$

 Such a solution depends however on the particular form of combined utility

 The form of a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the Pareto concern of how the asset utilities from poor and richer consumer
 are combined in a society thus form an important caveat for the effect
 of income differences on consumer selections

 A simple setting of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}(u_{1},u_{2})=\beta u_{1}+(1-\beta)u_{2}$

Notice that there are two factors in the cooperative solution with population
 stability that balance the increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the long-run.
 First is that the poorer consumer eventually runs out of budget 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 is a lot higher (i.e.
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is very high) and exercises 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 instead.
 Second is that the richer consumer withdraws with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 if the poorer consumer gets the promotion to a higher band very easily.
 Both of these both factors - are a result of the population stability condition
 and are thus independent of the combined utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

.
 As these factors would continue to hold for a non-cooperative solution,
 we can argue that the above dynamics for the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the long-run remain unchanged for a non-cooperative solution as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the goal of using the two conditions is to explore the effects
 of income difference 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on status competitions while incorporating the changes in competitions
 that occur to rise or fall in income-differences in the long-term.
 With the parameters controlling a specific form of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 endogenised within the equilibrium conditions, we are able to remedy the
 earlier issue with the short-term equilibrium that changes in income also
 change the competitions and 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 themselves.
 Unlike with the short-term equilibrium, in other words, the changes in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y=y_{2}-y_{1}$

 characterised by 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 As we show with numerical methods, this relationship does not necessarily
 result in consumers always increasing

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$

 We observe that a higher

 does cause the poorer consumer to withdraw from the competition so that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

 Similarly, a lower

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 More particularly, a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 creates the incentive for the consumer 1 to participate in the status investmen
ts and a certain range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 makes it worthwhile for both the consumers to have non-zero status investments
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

).
 However, both extremely low and high values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 force a withdrawal.
 An extremely low 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 makes the promotion extremely easy and causes the consumer 2 to withdraw
 i.e.
 reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 This is because the richer consumer would no longer be concerned with demotion
 if the opportunities to rise to the richer position are plenty.
 Similarly, an extremely high 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 causes the (poorer) consumer 1 to withdraw due to the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}<y_{1}$
\end_inset

It is also evident from the numerical methods that a widening of income
 differences would result in a higher expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 from consumer 1 if the consumer 2 withdraws from the competition.
 This is because the benefits from higher investments into status are higher
 if the other consumer does not participate.

 As the figure shows, the very low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 only make the status competition lucrative for the poorer consumer.
 However, there is only a certain level of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\equiv y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

until which high income differences encourage only consumer 1 to increase
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 - a level after which both consumers participate so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 rises by as much that the poorer consumer is no longer able to afford raising
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 , the optimal choice for consumer 1 is to reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 - thus letting consumer 2 pay for the high security implied by high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, an extremely large change in income differences reverses
 the withdrawal among the consumers - since a shift from low-income differences
 to high income-differences (through lowering of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

) causes the poorer consumer to no longer view any benefit from the status
 investment - a situation where any further rise in income differences only
 increases the investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 for consumer 2.
 Likewise, a shift from high-income differences to largely-similar income-differ
ences would mean that the richer consumer no longer sees any benefit from
 participating in the status competition - thus setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 to zero.
 Therefore, the lower differences in income - which is used to accumulate
 assets in the long-term - are as undesirable for the richer consumer as
 higher differences in income are for the poorer consumer.
 A widening in income-differences increases 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 - only until it becomes so high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is reduced to zero by the consumer 1.
 Similarly, a lowering of income differences decreases 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 until the incomes are so equal that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is reduced to zero.

The equilibrium levels of asset accumulations also correspond to the choices
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$

\end_inset

.
 An equilibrium with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily mean lower asset accumulations - since status investments
 also contribute to asset accumulation through social promotion in the model.
 The total asset accumulations implied by the selections 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 demonstrate that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 rise with rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 remains the same.
 With changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

, the total assets decline for the poorer consumer on withdrawal (i.e.
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

) and they rise for consumer 2 with rise in income difference.
 As the plots in Figure

\end_inset

 show, a high 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}+A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is achieved when all of the poorer consumer's disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is spent towards status investments.
 The withdrawal from status investments lowers the total accumulation 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}+A_{2}$
\end_inset

 until the point when changes in income difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 become so high that all gains through status investments only benefit the
 richer consumer.
 The result that total assets are higher either when status investments
 are at highest possible values for the poor consumer or when they benefit
 only the richer consumer in the long-term does confirm the intuition as
 well.

\begin_layout Standard
We had set ourselves to find how income inequality could influence status
 consumption as investments in an economy.
 Focusing on investments spent towards economic status, we use a two-band
 economy under the conditions of population stability and a known ordering
 of asset utilities for consumers to argue that a rise in income inequalities
 need not always raise investments in the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conditions that population stability must prevail in a long-term equilibrium
 of income bands and that there exists a known ordering for asset utilities
 for the rich and poor consumer - together imply that the expenditure towards
 status for the poorer (richer) consumer need not rise (fall) with increase
 in income differences since withdrawal of either the rich or the poor consumer.
 This is because an increase (decrease) in income inequalities can drive
 an increase (decrease) in status investments only as long as the poorer
 (richer) consumer does not withdraw from the status game - finding it no
 longer lucrative for positional improvement in the game.
 Thus, while it is tempting to argue using the short-term equilibrium conditions
 that wider income differences make status competitions more stringent and
 the expenditure towards status higher (lower) for the poorer (richer) consumer,
 the long-term equilibrium - under conditions of population stability and
 a known order of asset utilities for the rich and the poor consumer - imply
 a different dynamics where wide income differences could reduce expenditure
 towards status by making promotion difficult (for the poor consumers) or
 security cheaper (for the richer consumers).
 This also means that the combined asset accumulations for the rich and
 the poor consumer - might either rise or fall with higher income inequality.
 There is an important to the above result that we must also highlight i.e.
 that a risk with the accumulated wealth is necessary for there to be positional
 competition - one that promises income opportunities and securities to
 the respective positions in a finite-bands setting.
 In other words, an inequality in bands cannot maintain a steady state competiti
on without an inherent risk that sets an upper bound on wealth accumulation
 for the richer consumer.

 common pool of assets.
 In other words, the long-term equilibrium results suggest that inequality
 may increase redistribution through rise in investments for status.

In applications where consumer welfare follows from status investments such
 as education, the above model can be used to explain how constraints on
 resources in an economy with income segregation may limit the participation
 of poorer consumers despite an increase in opportunities for income mobility.
 The consideration of positional concerns of the economy in the model demonstrat
es how long-term constraints due to finite resources could lower the participati
on for investments such as education simply because the differences in socioecon
omic positions must also be maintained.

The proof to demonstrate the lack of feasible non-constant

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 that lead to stable asset-values in an economy with different income bands
 uses a general cost-function associated with the level of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 This function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(A)$
\end_inset

 is used to explain how consumers in the long-term equilibrium may balance
 future expected income with the costs imposed by the current assets.
 In empirical terms, this may correspond to expected expenditure required
 to maintain a certain level of wealth - including any maintenance fees,
 interest on loan, club memberships etc.
 that are associated with a certain level of wealth.
 We also define a net asset value function based on the general cost-function
 
\begin_inset Formula $c(A)$
\end_inset

 that represents the net value of assets after adjusting for asset-costs
\end_layout

Note that even if the consumer were allowed to use leverage (credit) by
 choosing costs higher than she can afford, the liquidity concerns would
 ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}<y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}<\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We now state the proof that no 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$

 would result in stable asset allows under no-risk and under population
 stability conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem*

There exist no

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The proof is stated for two bands and can be generalised for higher number
 of bands.
 Notice that the population-stability constraint for the two band-economy
 means the following condition for 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}$

Next, the long-term equilibrium implies a stability of asset levels so that

\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The above condition implies that the consumer balances her expected future
 income with the costs on her assets.
 The net asset value from being either in band 1 or band 2 would be balanced
 by the expected returns the consumer 1 gets from putting up 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 towards status competitions.
 Since the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 must be positive and less than unity, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{2})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 must be less than zero.
 In other words, the consumer in band 1 must move from a negative net asset-valu
e to a positive asset value in band 2 (or vice versa).
 Similarly, for the consumer in band 2, the following quantity must amount
 to zero in the long-term equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{2}(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2})\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})+(1-L_{2}(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}))\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2}) & \rightarrow0

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
L(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}) & =\frac{1}{1-\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2})}}\label{eq:l_lte}

\begin_layout Proof
Above ensures that the expected loss from being in band 1 is balanced by
 the security provided by

 For consumer 2, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2})}$

\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
As long as status competition is feasible for consumer 1, she should see
 an increase in the long-term net asset value by being in band 2.
 The possibility of moving from band 1 to band 2 only to observe the net
 asset value decline is ruled out because higher income bands are also meant
 to have a higher asset reference.
 Any peer effects associated with the assets would ensure a higher asset
 (comparative) reference in the higher asset-band.
 Thus while the consumer in band 1 cannot afford to have a decline in net
 asset value if she moves to the next band, the consumer in the rich band
 might accept a poorer band with a net increase in asset value.
 This implies that the the net asset-value function must be concave (see
