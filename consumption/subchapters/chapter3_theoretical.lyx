\begin_layout Title
Status as uncertainty in consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption by viewing all status-related consumption
 as potential investments for future jumps in consumer wealth.
 Status is observed simply as a state of financial stability and a part
 of the consumer's utility comprising of the value of wealth as well as
 the risk perceived in achieving a future wealth.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The studies on conspicuous consumption have recently explored visible consumptio
n in the developing economies.
 As a specific instance of status consumption, visible consumption is expected
 to occur through a certain type of (visible) goods that are assumed to
 be futile for the general needs of the consumer.
 This assumption has been attractive to the empirical analyses as it permits
 the separability of demand for visible goods from non-visible goods.
 While the empirical studies continue to explore more instances of conspicuous
 consumption based on identification of visible goods in various economies,
 we seek to understand the effect of wealth differences and stratification
 on status consumption in the current as we focus on the role of status
 consumption to offset observed wealth differences as it was identified
 in the first exploration on status consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus instead of assuming that much of status consumption occurs through
 visible commodities (clothing, shoes, jewelry etc.) in the developing economies,
 we revisit the framework of demand with a consideration of risk associated
 with the promotion through social rank advancement so as to view status
 consumption in a more general context.
 By elaborating a utility function comprising of wealth differences and
 risks associated with future wealth, we attempt to answer if separating
 equilibrium can exist between two consumers with differing risk-aversion
 behaviour and known to have a prospect theory (PT) behavior as they observe
 a common stochastic process with diminishing rewards for risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, we consider an environment where non-durable consumption
 is both and expense and a potential risky position for a future jump in
 social ranking.
 In such an environment, the end goal of the consumer would be to simply
 maximise her wealth.
 As an example of such an expense we can consider education where less expenditu
re is guaranteed to disadvantage the individual - not both because of how
 her value in the employment market and how it shuts opportunities for future
 rises in her income.
 The utility for education to the consumer therefore comprises both as value
 in the market after a future education and the probability of achieving
 the education.
 If we observe only such expenses i.e.
 those which affect savings and increase the probability of wealth transition,
 then we can incorporate the insights from PT in the consumer's choice for
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this simple model, income occurs only directly through increases in wealth.
 Since references points are key to understanding consumer choice under
 PT, we consider two consumers who would compete for wealth differences
 relative to a common reference point.
 The conditions for such a game to have a net payoff for both the rational
 consumers (rich and poor) under PT - necessitate the diminishing returns
 from taking too much risk and disadvantages from taking too little risk.
 The use of PT allows us to incorporate loss-aversion in consumer choice
 as well.
 We use the solution of the model to argue whether the presence of of risk-shari
ng in growing economies that are segmented by social class could have implicatio
ns for status consumption.
 We hope that such a framework would help us answer if the consumers in
 one economy may engage in status consumption more often than they do in
 another.

Status consumption was notably elaborated by Veblen

 in his 1899 treatise titled

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 to effectually mend the consumerâ€™s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advancements in game theory and statistics from the last century - particula
rly the theory of decision under risk - can explain some of the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour that Veblen had observed in the late
 19th century.
 Decision theory (see von Neumann-Morgenstern
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VonNeumannMorgenstern1944"

\end_inset

) explains many of the apparent paradoxes in human behaviour (see Dhami
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

) while the effect that social conditions have on human behaviour remains
 an area of active research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 We argue that it is possible within the remit of the theory to view status
 consumption - the disproportionate spending on goods that only have a status
 (or visible) appeal - as an instance of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour.
 We inherit from the literature on habit formation and visible consumption
 while adopting this approach to status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature from behavioural economics, marketing research and development
 economics all seem to concur on the tendencies of habit formation in consumer
 behaviour.
 The measurement of changes in habits and quality has a long tradition in
 neoclassical economics (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment of the problem).
 Of particular interest is the model for myopia amongst consumers described
 by Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who had noted the significance of lagged consumption on aggregate consumption.
 The life-cycle model used by Muellbauer has been of considerable importance
 in the more recent studies on consumption where a rational utility-optimising
 consumer balances between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned savings over her life-time (a problem often treated equivalent
 to the classical utility maximising consumption problem).
 Improving upon the classical approach to the intertemporal substitution
 problem - where the consumer is subservient to her optimised plan for life-time
 savings and consumption - a few behavioural approaches (see Shefrin-Thaler
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for example) have sought descriptive models for mental accounting and factors
 such as willpower to better understand the development of habits in consumers.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice, the
 representative consumer in such models is subject to overeating, overspending,
 accumulating items she doesn't need or acquiring habits she cannot afford.

A general approach that we use to incorporate the role that personal characteris
tics play in consumption has been presented by Corneo et al

 The authors motivate a case for a ranking order of status - where the consumer
 attempts to move herself up in the ranking order.
 The literature in marketing

 and political economy

 have explored a relationship between identity, ownership and consumption.
 The literature from sociological studies has for long indicated the role
 that industrial goods and income rises play in addressing of status needs
 by the consumers (see Srinivas

 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 noted an instance of Veblen's pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (referred to as

 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 Elsewhere too, rapid industrialisation has created a disproportionate change
 in lifestyles with a crowding effect towards urbanisation

.
 The empirical analyses of based on such studies - however - have been of
 a limited scope due to the unobserved nature of many of the factors identified
 in the studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent literature on conspicuous consumption has focused on visible consumption
 as a particular instance of conspicuous consumption - assuming that it
 brings no utility in the regular sense (see Ireland 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, Hopkins-Kornienko 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 The argument - often attributed to Veblen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 allows one to consider the utility for visible consumption separable (additivel
y) from the utility for non-visible consumption (we refer to this assumption
 as the futility assumption henceworth).
 In the current chapter, we follow a slightly different approach based on
 the intertemporal substitution problem - viewing snob and bandwagon behaviours
 as the fundamental mechanisms for any status utility availed by the consumer
 consumer.
 We also include wealth differences and non-durable consumption in this
 intertemporal setting - so that the competing behaviours of snob and bandwagon
 items are driven by the uncertainty perceived by the consumer.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor
 that they belong to a club that poor don't (invidious comparison).
 We have found Corneo's terminology more tractable for empirical analyses

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such an uncertainty-based notion of status can be seen a state of wealth
 representing the long-term security of the consumer from extreme income
 fluctuations.
 This is the sense in which status is usually interpreted in health and
 sociological sciences literature - often tracking status with a vector
 of income, education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 However, a demand equation for status goods that considers status as a
 mere demographic vector ignores the dynamic nature of status and the demand
 for bandwagon items.
 Status is essentially a social psychological concern and is often observed
 at the level of a social unit (individual or a reference group).
 So while a researcher observing a population of consumers may interpret
 the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk associated with the transition
 to the highest band of net-worth in the long-term as status, the consumer
 necessarily has a subjective view of her status.
 This subjective view of status is influenced by local factors that may
 be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

averaged out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at higher levels.
 What status means at the consumer's level may in fact even disagree with
 what status means at a higher societal-levels.
 This is because the consumer's view of status would respond to the socio-politi
cal conditions that she perceives from within a particular social unit (family,
 community, ethnicity or region) than the observed variables that are standardis
ed over a large area.
 Status consumption therefore is necessarily localised at the consumer's
 social reference level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This too has implications for our notion of status.
 From a rather ontological perspective, a high-status individual is someone
 who, in the long-term, has either or both of high income and a high (inter-gene
rational) probability to move towards the high income group (stability).
 Let's call this the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of wealth transition (i.e.
 a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{ij}\}$
\end_inset

 representing the transition from wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) - which the researcher observes.
 A low-status individual - similarly - is someone who has either or both
 of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 The researcher - concerned with the long-term effect of such factors to
 the asset ownership and stability of income - may assume that all consumers
 observe the same probability of transition to higher state of income but
 the consumer would be motivated by the particular short-term concerns with
 respect to the social unit that influence her view of status and self-image.
 Thus the uncertainty of wealth transition is observed at multiple levels
 in this subjective formulation of probability.
 The probability of material wealth transition that a consumer associates
 with the future is fundamentally subjective - although determined largely
 by factors related to social or regional identity.
 For the purposes of this discussion, we consider this latter sense as the
 consumer's 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability of wealth transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that status consumption (other than the standardised variables)
 depends on a 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 (personal) uncertainty one attaches to possible future states of wealth
 and use the decision theory framework to understand status consumption
 as a choice of excess non-durable consumption vs long-term ownership of
 assets.
 It follows that the consumer's 
\shape italic
subjective 
\shape default
probability is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as her
 occupation, education, social or familial background, personality types
 etc.
 and is subject to change over the her lifetime.
 Since consumption is usually myopic, such a view would influence consumption
 at all times.
 The notion of status, self-reference and peer effects all influence the
 risk-seeking behaviour of the consumer which are captured in the consumer's
 the 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability function.
 On the other hand, the growth in the income and wealth of the consumer,
 unlike the subjective probability which drives consumption in the near
 term, are constrained with long-term economic conditions and can be assumed
 to be associated with a different 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that in the long-term there would be no difference
 between the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probabilities.
 So while the non-durable consumption of the consumers would be associated
 with their view in the short-term, in the long-term what matters is whether
 they have achieved a higher state of wealth (and thus status) or not.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider three consumers with different
 occupations in a small economy - an academic, a sportsperson and an investor
 - who all share the share the same reference point (by assumption) for
 wealth.
 They would all estimate the probability of doubling their wealth in the
 lifetime so that they may retire on the successful achievement of their
 goal.
 Given the nature of the profession, it is likely that the sportsperson
 overestimates the probability of her success until the middle of her career
 - after which the probability she associates to the success of doubling
 her wealth (if she hasn't already) would decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus a risk-seeking behaviour would be associated with a sportsperson much
 the way a risk-averse behaviour is associated with the academic who may
 be well aware of the limited probability of a windfall in the short-term.
 On the other hand, an investor may obtain a definite gain over a fixed
 term and have a risk-profile that lies somewhere in between that of the
 sportsperson and the academic.
 While the long-term decisions of the sportsperson may still be determined
 by the knowledge of expected income, a sportsperson would be characterised
 by a belief in an unlikely probability of success in the near-term in a
 way that is different from how an academic or an investor would foresee
 her future possible wealth transition.
 If we can assume that the three consumers have the same basic needs, it
 is unlikely that the consumption of the three individuals would be independent
 of how they view the transition probability of their monetary wealth in
 the near term.
 Still in the long-term it is only their success in monetary terms that
 would track their status.
 To state whether a risk-seeking consumer spends more or less on non-durable
 consumption we attempt to understand the consumer's goal in the intertemporal
 setting (where status consumption may appear to be less beneficial than
 saving for assets).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the above outline of a model, we can separate the consumer's choice
 that would impart varied degrees of certainty - the most certain choice
 being of a cash asset and the most uncertain choices being a flashy piece
 of jewelry.
 We represent the group of durable goods indicating a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

certain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth acquisition as a wealth account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 ) - which she utilises regardless of her risk-appetite.
 Thus a risk-seeking individual may get more utility from the non-durable
 consumption than the risk-averse individual (see Lowenstein-Prelec 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BrennerVLA2007,ShuPeckOwnership2011"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for the relation between loss-aversion and possessions).
 If the long-term assets can be considered as part of the wealth that can
 be passed on to generations, the short-term concerns of the consumer (which
 are influenced by the acquired wealth) are sensitive to the degree of risk-aver
sion.
 This also means that if there is any status related utility to be derived
 from non-durable consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from
 its excess quantity with respect to one's reference group.
 This is simply because a consumer with a habit of high quality in regular
 consumption would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfilment of basic consumer needs itself carries no influence on status.
 It follows that if we were to compare the consumption of a risk-seeking
 consumers with that of a risk-averse consumer, the consumption on needs
 would not have any role to play in the utility relative to one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we associate non-durable consumption with the subjective probability,
 the status-related consumption (seen as high non-durable consumption) is
 exhibited as a risk-seeking behaviour i.e.
 when the 
\shape italic
subjective 
\shape default
probability is much higher than the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability.
 Those who are hoping to enhance their social network or get ahead of others
 through signaling (or peer effects) are likely to believe in a higher likelihoo
d of their promotion to a higher status.
 A higher probability for the state promotion perceived by a risk-seeking
 consumer would thus result in a higher utility for the same observed probabilit
y.
 Similarly, the perceived probability of loss of one's status would be higher
 (e.g.
 that of threat of immigration to one's personal wealth) than the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability in the long-term for a risk-averse consumer.

The arguments for subjective probability that we use to develop our status

 A more formal treatment of subjective probability is offered by de Finetti

 and Savage

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be worthwhile to hypothesise the economic processes that are implied
 by an interplay of the two levels of uncertainties that we use to separate
 the uncertainty in observed economic variables from the degrees of risk-aversio
n exhibited amongst consumers.
 One way to view the two uncertainties is as a delay or barriers in the
 flow of information related to risks in the consumer markets.
 When it comes to risks to the future wealth, the firms and institutions
 are often both better equipped and more responsive than the individuals
 or small communities.
 The differences in subjective uncertainties and observed uncertainties
 only because of the differences in how information is consumed at different
 levels of societal organisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The barrier to information may help elucidate the limits to the free-market
 assumption which considers an autonomous consumer fully capable of addressing
 her true needs (see a discussion in Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 There is little doubt that the differences in purchasing power between
 sections of a society and their desire for mobility can drive the consumption
 and the economy (see Smith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmithMoralSentiments"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 But the implicit assumption in the free market view of an exchange between
 the rich and poor sections driving economic progress is that the consumer
 has full information of the risks and incentives related to her wealth
 (i.e.
 the economy functions in a way that these risks are known to the consumer).
 The barriers to the flow of information with a growing strength of institutions
 - which a consideration of the two uncertainties which we attempt to model
 - could partly explain why this exchange may be less feasible in more recent
 times (see Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Galbraith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GalbraithEssential,GalbraithAffluent"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This effect would be particularly visible in the economies undergoing structura
l changes such as rapid industrialisation, higher advertising effects or
 centralisation of markets.
 As long as it can be admitted that the information about socio-economic
 changes is consumed at different speeds and extent amongst the consumers
 than firms then it must follow that the information of risks is not considered
 fully by the consumer.
 Thus the consumption in the short-term is likely to be influenced by asymmetrie
s in the observation of risk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the model to be of any empirical utility, it must be acknowledge that
 the beliefs of the consumers converge to the observed economic variables
 in the long run.
 The resources in the world evolve as they are influenced by the actions
 taken on beliefs rather than beliefs themselves.
 In the long-run, the consumer beliefs reflect the changes in long-term
 assets by letting the risk-averse behaviours balance the risk-seeking behaviour
s in participate in the same economy.
 Thus the consumers' subjective probability functions are reconciled with
 an observed trajectory of wealth over a sufficiently long-period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be worthwhile at this point to compare the approach we've taken with
 the permanent income hypothesis (PIH).
 The fundamental claim of the PIH is that income has a transitory and a
 permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional to the
 permanent component
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancellation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 But we find Friedman's assumption of the independence (zero-correlation)
 between the transitory component and the permanent component - far stronger
 than the condition required viewing non-durable consumption under risk
 in the intertemporal substitution framework.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The zero-correlation assumption is precluded by how subjective probability
 is reconciled with the observed probability in a stochastic process representin
g the the evolution of wealth over time.
 As the items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 are considered a part of wealth while those that cannot be passed are considere
d short-term, the observed probability is contributed to by the assets transferr
ed between generations in the long-run.
 The assumption rests on the argument that there is little more than the
 net asset worth of the individual and the personal characteristics (such
 as social class) that are passed over as inheritance to the progeny.
 On the other hand, the subjective probability of success through social
 interactions and the high quality consumption associated with it need not
 matter in the long-term - since the path to net asset worth may completely
 ignore the non-durable consumption habits of the past.
 Unlike with a permanent income approach the two uncertainties are thus
 not expected to be independent of each other but are reconciled by transfer
 and ownership of long-term assets in the economy.
 Contrasting with PIH - which observes the dispersion in income amongst
 socio-economic classes (gauged with a simple variance in past income) as
 a measure of risk - we also wish to included the effect of the dispersion
 in quality of consumption and wealth owing to social hierarchy in consumer
 choice.
 Thus unlike PIH, we cannot explicitly ignore the role of

 Even with the relative income concerns

 (which can be incorporated in PIH), status-related consumption is an aberration
 if the consumer is meant to always achieve the goal of improving her wealth
 by minimising the volatility of income streams.
 If conspicuous consumption were truly futile, then there would be no way
 for the rational consumer to derive any utility from status-related consumption.
 The explicit subjective uncertainty - represented with a probability weighting
 function - models the advantage one receives from status consumption and
 allows the representative consumer to deviate from her long-term plans.

 were rational.
 In the context of status consumption which we are concerned with, the mere
 existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there is some utility
 to be derived by spending what is not rationally advantageous to the consumer
 in the long-term

 Focusing on excess non-durable consumption and wealth, our approach does

 consumption but includes it in a wider concern for status and growth in

\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The view of status consumption as simply the excess non-durable consumption
 could appear incongruous with how conspicuous consumption is usually presented
 in the public discourse i.e.
 as a phenomenon that only-serves-the-rich.
 Even though we view a conspicuous item as one that can be used both to
 distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself, there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst
 the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 If we could admit a definition of status consumption as a means to distinguish
 oneself from one's own reference group and agree that everyone belongs
 to a particular reference group, then we must conclude that everyone can
 benefit from status consumption (i.e.
 a probabilistic improvement of the consumer's perceived status can be achieved
 with status consumption).
 Further, if the long-term consumption is defined as assets that stay the
 same over many generations (so that all else is considered non-durable)
 then a focus on non-durable consumption may sufficiently capture the sense
 of conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of significant wealth differences, another reason object
 to the view of status consumption as a consumption exclusive to the rich
 is that the utility to the rich from status consumption might be quite
 little given the fact that the rich consumer already has enough to distance
 herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have
 anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave
 anyone behind).
 Instead, one could argue that even the poorest may want to indicate that
 they are not the poorest - much the way richest may want it to be known
 to the others that they are indeed the richest

 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 may in fact be needed by both the rich and the poor.
 Indeed everyone else in the middle (i.e.
 those who are neither the richest nor the poorest) must also try to avoid
 getting poorer and try to become the richest at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, our approach for status consumption is quite similar to the
 one used by the studies in visible consumption but it also differs in its
 treatment of uncertainty.
 While we do view the net utility from status consumption as a combination
 of a private utility (subjective) and a public utility (observed through
 rise in wealth), a key goal of ours has been to consider the extreme wealth
 difference and the upside risk associated with consumption.
 Formulating status consumption as risk associated with the future states
 of wealth and the utility from status consumption as a probabilistic private
 utility, we use prospect theory to understand the competition for status.
 An essential difference from the literature on visible consumption is therefore
 that the status utility from such consumption is not futile in a material
 sense.
 Indeed a luxury watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared
 to its cheaper alternatives that offer the same functionality i.e.
 that of telling the current time) but if an aspiring businessman uses his
 knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business, then
 the futile consumption may probabilistically translate into a material
 advantage.
 The promise of social mobility is indeed the core appeal of status consumption.
 Items like luxury watches are in fact important only because the rich flock
 around them.
 But if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
 In other words, if one considers conspicuous consumption futile it can
 only be in a material sense that does not consider the consumer's perception
 of risk.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We argue that the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may offer
 is important to the consumer as it acts as a means of connecting the rich
 with the not-so rich in the long-term.
 Further, the consumption of status item is driven by a small chance of
 success - a probability which the consumer is likely to overestimate or
 underestimate ( gauged with a probability weighting function).
 In the long-term one must reconcile the subjective probabilities with an
 observed wealth process - only a few of the purchasers of luxury watches
 would improve their self-image and enhance their social networks to achieve
 material wealth - others would remain mere purchasers.

\begin_layout Standard
A typical inter-temporal model of substitution between savings and consumption
 relies on observed income, savings, an interest rate of growth as well
 as depreciation/discounting factor.
 Following this approach, if consumption could be split into certain and
 uncertain parts, then one could associate the two with the observed and
 subjective probabilities.
 More particularly, one could argue that the growth of the consumer's income
 process is independent of the subjective uncertainty (higher probability
 to landing in a state of higher status than what is known through more
 deterministic trends of income) which influences the non-durable consumption.
 Still, a key factor with such a formulation is the assumed depreciation
 (or discount factor) and a growth-rate associated with the wealth.
 The literature has often used a discounting based on education and social
 classes or other demographic variables (see Cagetti
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CagettiWealth2003"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumption of an exogenous interest rate or a depreciation factor assumes
 too much about the consumer expectations for wealth whose relationship
 with consumption we wish to understand.
 Therefore we assume no exogenous depreciation and interest rate in a basic
 model where two consumers may compete for more assets and relative non-durable
 consumption.
 Instead, we focus on how the consumers' evaluation of future risks would
 affect their choice.
 Therefore the depreciation of wealth in the model is only through direct
 expenditure - which in turns consists only of consumption or investment.
 Needs don't offer status advantage to either of the consumer in the model
 while a higher non-durable consumption offers a probabilistic advantage.
 As the advantage from nondurable consumption is probabilistic, the consumer
 doesn't choose to spend all wealth on non-durable consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain the how the perception of uncertainty may affect consumer choice,
 we contrast two approaches - one where the growth of wealth is deterministic
 and the other where the evolution of wealth is a stochastic process evaluated
 by the consumer.
 As detailed in the sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Non-Stochastic"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Stochastic"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the two models differ in how consumer's effort or investments relates
 to the payoff in every period.
 The first (non-stochastic case) considers a certain payoff for effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and thus a deterministic path to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 while the stochastic case considers a risky payoff (and an uncertain path
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $A)$
\end_inset

 for a given non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that the latter (stochastic) approach may offer an instance closer
 to the real world.
 This is because it is in evaluating a future path to higher-wealth (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) where the status competitions are unleashed.
 In this latter (stochastic) case, the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 effectively determines the risk the consumer takes towards the future state
 of wealth.
 A more risk-seeking individual is thus meant to have an increase non-durable
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 As the payoff in every period is risky, the non-durable consumption also
 mirrors the perception of risk with the future asset (this is because any
 consumption that is not non-durable adds towards wealth in the model).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that since the we're considering utility from relative non-durable
 consumption, the needs of the consumer (which are common by definition)
 have no role to play in the utility as the needs are by definition common
 for both the consumers.
 The claim that the consumption above needs represents consumers risk in
 the stochastic case is the equivalent of the claim in the non-stochastic
 case that a consumer competes with others with both non-durable consumption
 and wealth.
 Also, the consumers assumed to be competing in the model could be seen
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dynasties
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that observe a risky growth of wealth.
 Thus the effect of family size and of life-cycle are ignored in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also compare how the two models would behave under the assumption that
 extreme wealth differences are not sustainable in a society and necessitate
 an income redistribution (e.g.
 taxation).
 The key question we wish to answer with the model is whether the risk-averse
 consumers may settle for less status consumption when competing with those
 having higher wealth possession or not.

Non-Stochastic Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a non-stochastic case, consider two consumers 1 and 2 who compete with
 each other for the assets they possess.
 A degenerate case would be one where each consumer has a certain wealth
 level but with no other option other than bearing a cost/depreciation on
 her wealth account e.g.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\Delta A}{A}=-\psi$
\end_inset

.
 If utility is only achieved from wealth, then clearly she would have no
 incentive to raise this rate of decline with more consumption so as to
 prolong the lifetime of the wealth she possesses.
 If we have two consumers who both observe each other's wealth then too,
 the consumer has no incentive to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 from its minimum possible value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degenerate case is of no practical use as there is nothing that the
 two consumers can compete over.
 To provide some incentive to the poorer consumer (lower wealth account
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ) for her to participate in the game, we can introduce an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 from consumer's effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

.
 Now each consumer gets to change the destiny of her wealth as she gets
 an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\xi$
\end_inset

 for effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and hopes to bridge gap between wealth accounts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without any natural decline or growth with the wealth, we can also introduce
 a cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 associated a wealth account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 so that the consumer with higher wealth bears a higher absolute cost included
 in the non-durable consumption.
 This makes sense since the more wealth one has the task of maintaining
 wealth bears some costs as well.
 Consider now the dynamics of wealth for two consumers in this no-uncertainty
 model with income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{t})$
\end_inset

, we can write:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
A_{t+1,1}=A_{t,1}-\delta(A_{t,1}+\pi\xi_{1})+\pi\xi_{1}\nonumber \\
A_{t+1,2}=A_{t,2}-\delta(A_{t,2}+\pi\xi_{2})+\pi\xi_{2}\label{eq:dynamics_expenditure}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without loss of generality, let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 As long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi>1$
\end_inset

, the consumer 1 would increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1,t+1}/A_{2,t+1}$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer 2 would similarly maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2,t+1}/A_{1,t+1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the game is to end at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, then the consumer 2 must always choose a 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not occur before time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, if the consumers only cared about relative wealth then
 there is no reason for the consumer 2 to allow 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}$
\end_inset

 before 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the consumer 1 would like to achieve 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 soon as possible instead of having to wait until 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The equilibrium state of such a game is when either 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 or when 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}\ge0$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is maintained as desired by consumer 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without a cost function with a steep upward rise in cost for the richer
 consumer such a game would not be too different from the degenerate case
 as it offers no incentive to the poorer consumer.
 Another possibility to make the game feasible is to consider that the consumers
 don't actually optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively but the combinations 
\begin_inset Formula $(\xi_{1},A_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\xi_{2},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 instead.
 After all in the real world we judge those around us not just by their
 wealth but by what they do with their wealth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That could indeed make the game worthwhile to play for both the consumers.
 There are two fundamental ways to include the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

) in the view of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 First is to let an explicit combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,A$
\end_inset

 in a loglinear or a similar form (so that there is some substitution between
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 both in within period and across periods i.e.
 the intertemporal substitution).
 The second way is to view either just 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

( or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) adjusted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 respectively).
 It could be for example argued that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is all that is visible and is competed with - so that there is a fair game
 to play between consumer 1 and 2.
 The wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may still matter but only in the providing the upper bound for 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 (poorer consumer cannot afford too much 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

).
 This is an approach similar to what is followed in some of the literature
 on visible consumption.
 Indeed when the differences in wealth are high, a fair game based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 alone may not be plausible (the poor consumer's 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is not going to be of much relative value).
 In such a case, we cannot ignore the role that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 plays.
 This is why we seek a game considering 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which 
\shape italic

To combine 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

Notice that the consideration of relative wealth must always carry a sense
 of reference point in the above equation.
 We assume that the reference point is between

\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 and choose a geometric mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A_{1}A_{2}}$
\end_inset

 as the dynamic reference point for the loglinear utility comprising of
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 The utility to be maximised for the consumer 1 and 2 are therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{1}{A_{2}}\sqrt{\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}},\xi_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{1}{A_{1}}\sqrt{\frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}}},\xi_{2})$

\end_inset

 for consumer 1 (

A fundamental limitation of the above model is that the difference in wealth
 accounts can grow wider without any recourse.
 For the two consumers to continue with the game it makes sense to allow
 an income redistribution so that a fixed proportion of the total wealth
 difference is given to the poor consumer.
 In a simple extension of the the model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 above, we introduce a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 on relative wealth which is transferred to the poorer consumer.
 The dynamics in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
It can be verified that the amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 transferred to the poorer consumer reduces to 0 when both the consumers
 achieve the same wealth (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 This is particularly interesting when utility is derived both from 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - as it gives the dynamics the characteristics of a zero sum game.
 With such a redistribution in place, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $>A_{1}$

 then the consumer might want to keep

As we have argued before - the assumption of wealth depreciating or rising
 at a constant rate is too limiting for the purpose of modeling the effect
 on uncertainty on consumer choice.
 To represent a scenario closer to the real-world, we consider an uncertainty
 both in the consumer's perception of her future wealth and that in the
 path that the wealth would follow.
 The perception of the consumer is represented with a probability weighting

 A wealthy individual in the model does not just silently earn interest
 on income - but has to compete with others who are acquiring new wealth
 by investing into newer areas.
 Competing with others and guarding one's wealth, the consumer has no choice
 but to bet on uncertain pursuits in order for her to grow her wealth

 the risk-seeking individuals and risk-averse individuals.

\begin_layout Standard
In the stochastic formulation, the consumer's intertemporal choice is viewed
 as a simple lottery scheme.
 As the consumer's investments (i.e.
 consumption which is indistinguishable from needs) are hoped to increase
 the asset in some way, the expectation of growth in one's assets is embedded
 in the expenditure one makes.
 Anything that is not expended contributes to the saving towards wealth
 for the consumer.
 Over generations the wealth can either decline significantly or grow in
 value due to the strategy adopted by the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since staying in an elite non-durable consumption club offers only a probabilist
ic benefit, we represent the consumer's choice as one amognst many lotteries.
 The examples for such an expenditure would be a club membership or expertise
 in conspicuous items which might eventually get the consumer in the rich
 club over generations albeit with a low probability.
 The various lotteries available to the consumer could range from a secure
 cash savings to a balanced strategy of spending towards education in the
 hope for income rise over years or a bet on an expensive club membership
 in a hope for relevant social connections.
 Note the consumer's own risk-profile always influences the selection of
 a particular lottery.
 In other words, the same observed probability may be considered too risky
 or not risky enough for consumers with different degrees of risk-aversion
 (a feature that is modeled with the probability weighting function

\begin_layout Standard
Using prospect theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 we elaborate a utility function that evaluates the various lotteries for
 a consumer.
 Any given lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is seen as a sequence of payoffs 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $u(L)=\sum_{i}w(p_{i})\upsilon(x_{i})$

 (
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 is the probability weighting function and 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(x)$
\end_inset

 is the payoff-utility function for the consumer).
 If we assign probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 to the various options 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 distributed with a known distribution function to the consumer, we can
 asses the relative importance of the options to the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not having assumed a depreciation or an interest-based growth with the wealth
 account allows us to attribute the growth or depreciation in the wealth
 account to the consumer's perceived uncertainty in an environment of risky
 future growth for wealth.
 To accentuate the uncertainty in the growth of wealth, consider a gold
 rush economy where more digging increases the chances of getting a higher
 wealth.
 This is comparable to finding new wealth in an economy - where luck favours
 the prepared.
 Except through consumption, there is no inherent depreciation assumed for
 the wealth.
 This means that an immense wealth would deplete only with a high rate of
 consumption.
 It also means that if a consumer makes no new investments (search for gold)
 the competing consumers might find more wealth leading to her relative
 poverty in the economy.
 Both consumption and investment - which are indistinguishable empirically
 - are represented as one variable

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$

 infinitely increase one's wealth at a non-decreasing rate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net effect of investments

 It is worth noting that in contrast with the non-stochastic approach, the
 consumer utility under risk is fundamentally different from the utility
 derived without risk (see Shoemaker

 The PT utility dictates that the behaviour of a risk-seeking consumer would
 be different in the stochastic model from that of a risk-averse consumer.
 More particularly, a consumer is allowed to have an irrational expectation
 of closing the wealth gap in the stochastic model whereas the non-stochastic
 utility model implied that a consumer with lower wealth could always get
 the same overall utility as a consumer with higher wealth if their consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 Given the limited supported for expected-value maximisation in behavioural

 is optimised by the consumer in favour of those where the consumer optimises
 a utility

The simplest of such cases are those where

 is enhanced with some risk-aversion parameters (see Sharpe 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 It follows with the function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{t+1})$
\end_inset

 that a a risk neutral consumer making a one-time decision on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 based on a time horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 would choose a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{CE}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $X_{t\in[1,T]}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))=u(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 is maximised.
 A risk-seeking consumer would choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{CE}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{CE}))=u(A_{CE})$
\end_inset

 The consumer choosing

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E($

\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T}))>E(u(A_{CE}))$
\end_inset

 is considered risk-seeking and the consumer selecting 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))<E(u(A_{CE}))$
\end_inset

 would be considered risk-averse.
 If we use a CRRA utilty to illustrate this further, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\frac{A^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$

 leading to 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T})$

 being maximised when 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 is maximised with 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi:(\frac{d\sigma}{d\psi}=\frac{1}{p(1-p)})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d\sigma}{d\psi}>0$
\end_inset

).
 The measure of risk-aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 in the CRRA function is essentially a measure of the curvature of a value
 function.
 If every consumer optimises 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 then consumer has no reason to deviate from the maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A_{T})$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is unlikely to represent a real-world scenario.
 Firstly, the consumer derives utility also from consumption (which we have
 already noted).
 Secondly, there is little evidence in support of the consumer preference
 following a CRRA or CARA type utility (see Dhami

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 - it is that wealth under a perceived uncertainty is controlled only through
 consumption (or investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 This represents a particular situation of uncertainty in growth of wealth
 such that i) wealth declines only through consumption (risk) and ii) the
 consumption (risk taken) is fully under control of the consumer.
 We could thus arrive at a solution to the equation if we assume diminishing
 returns for a risky gain 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$

\begin_layout Standard
Using PT allows us to incorporate a desired feature where not every consumer
 has the same response to the same 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of growth in wealth.
 To model the attitude towards risk, we consider a weighting of probability
 to differentiate the risk-seeking behaviour from the risk-averse behaviour.
 Also since we let the consumption and investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 track the perceived uncertainty in the stochastic dynamics, we no longer
 need to worry about the combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - as they are equivalent to the combination of risk and value in PT.
 Note that a consumer who chooses no risk would set 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=0$

 The combined utility of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be written as the combined utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{A\in\mathscr{A}}\upsilon(A)w(P(A))$

\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathscr{A}$

 where a certain unobserved factors may contribute to the probability weighting

 Keeping the Bernoulli setting with probability

), the above approach also has another desirable property which is of a
 descriptive importance.
 It is that the utility represents the loss-aversion in wealth as well (i.e.
 the consumer dislikes losses more than she likes profits).

The PT approach also allows us understand the cost-function

\end_inset

 from the non-stochastic approach (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 is a vector of relevant personal characteristics) as an investment towards
 the higher probability of a windfall.
 In other words, if success were a lottery, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 would be the cost to be paid to take part in the lottery.
 This cost may rise steeply as the rich gets richer.
 In the stochastic model, the cost of participation is part of the

\end_inset

 which is paid to improve the likelihood of change in wealth.
 So the individual receives the higher likelihood of wealth change only
 after an upfront asset bearing cost 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$

 is paid.
 Thus the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t,}\rho)$

Notice that the equilibria would now involve the stochastic term as well.
 The risk-taking is therefore shared between the two consumers with different
 risk-profiles.
 This helps us refine how redistribution policies such as taxation might
 allow an equilibrium for risk-seeking and risk-averse individuals to exist.
 This is relevant for status consumption because the risk-sharing across
 groups segmented by social strata, occupation or class - would imply that
 status consumption is not necessarily important when the class differences
 are strong.
 Indeed an income-sharing arrangement does influence status consumption
 through the risk-sharing as well.
 This is indeed the refinement that had sought for the effect of wealth
 differences on status consumption.

 In the real-world, the choice of the distribution of

 As such, the inheritable wealth would decline in value when it's not invested

 In a declining economy (consider depletion of gold in our example), even
 though wealth may depreciate slower it would still keep the consumer's
 relative advantage to others and the consumers would continue to form an
 expectation of increased future wealth just the same.
 It can be argued that wealth in the economy is important not only because
 of the purchasing power but fundamentally due to the social order in the
 form of an expectation held by other participants in the economy that they
 can repeat the success of the wealthy by acting as participants in the
 economy

 In a developing economy, basic education may be a high-risk / high-reward
 expenditure if it is sparingly available, but it may be fairly low-risk
 low-reward expenditure in a developed country with state-support.
 The expected upside risks with selection of residential neighborhood may
 similarly be fairly low-risk low-reward in densely populated areas but
 low-risk high-reward in rural areas.
 The task to represent all risks the consumers takes in a given economy
 as a one-dimensional random variable is one that may require critical assumptio

Separating the income process from the perception of wealth also helps us
 understand the differences in consumer demand for status consumption in
 two populations that are distant in terms of a macroeconomic variable or
 a supply characteristic (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy).
 More particularly, if we may set 
\shape italic

\shape default
 inputs to the uncertainty in income growth (i.e.
 the 
\shape italic

probability), we could separate the effects of supply issues from the demand
 for status in the respective economies.
 When comparing a developed economy with a developing economy, for example,
 the strength of welfare institutions is of a particular significance.
 In the developed economy, on one hand, the state institutions intervene
 when market forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertaki
ngs or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distributio
n of public goods.
 When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 The uncertainty in observed probability can capture this difference as
 we compare developed economy with a developing economy and help separate
 the consumer demand from the disparate economic conditions

To illustrate why the uncertainty of an income process may be important
 for measures of status consumption, consider the status imparted through
 education - whose quality may vary in a particular economy.
 As a consequence of the difference in expectation of growth, education
 may carry more status-value in the developing world than it would in the
 developed world - simply because the distribution of education (and other
 similar assets that may be public goods) is state-assisted in a developed
 country and the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny is
 lowered.
 Thus, the extent to which education may eventually matter towards status
 in the developed economy depends on how consumers set themselves apart
 in the social order based on other means of signaling status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), a consumer would
 associate higher risk with the expected growth in education (which can
 be modeled with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability in the income process).
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support in a developing country.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions thus determines the expectation of accumulation
 of public goods (such as family education level) as how much education
 may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect of the strength of
 institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets that may provide
 the expanded consumption choices to the consumer.
 The two uncertainties in the model allow us to perform such comparisons
 by parametrising the disparate conditions as the

If one chooses to ignore the modeling of a parameter for strength of welfare
 institutions altogether (due to the belief that the demand for conspicuous
 consumption eventually benefits the society as a whole as the money is
 reinvested for the benefit of the poor in exchange for their services),
 it would still be instructive to parametrise the efficacy of institutions
 that would collect the money obtained from the rich on conspicuous items
 and fund employment and other opportunities.
