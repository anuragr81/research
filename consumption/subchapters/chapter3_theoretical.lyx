\begin_layout Title
Status as uncertainty in consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is developing by viewing all status-related
 consumption as perceived investments towads future mobility in consumer
 wealth.
 A prospect theory utility is used for the consumer wealth and the perceived
 risk for future wealth to describe risk-sharing equilibria in consumers
 with differing degrees of risk-aversion and long-term wealth.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The studies on conspicuous consumption have recently explored visible consumptio
n in the developing economies.
 Generally viewed as a specific instance of status consumption, visible
 consumption is assumed to occur through a certain type of (visible) goods
 that are futile for the consumer.
 This assumption permits the separability of demand for visible goods from
 non-visible goods in the empirically analyses.
 Identifying visible goods with independent surveys, many studies have explored
 the demand for visible goods using the consumption microdata from budget
 surveys in the developing economies.
 Instead of using an approach that relies on such a survey of visible items
 we review what status consumption would mean in the context of wealth differenc
es and social stratification - whose effects may not be captured by a simple
 selection of visible items.
 In thus restating status consumption, we bank on the first explorations
 in status consumption where it has been identified as a way for the consumer
 to offset the existing wealth or income differences

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of assuming that much of status consumption occurs through visible
 commodities (clothing, shoes, jewelry etc.), we use a framework of demand
 under risk - where an uncertainty is associated with the promotion of one's
 social rank.
 By elaborating a utility function comprising both of wealth differences
 and the risks associated with future wealth, we attempt to answer if a
 separating equilibrium can exist between two consumers with differing degrees
 of risk-aversion and known to have a prospect theory (PT) behavior as they
 observe a common stochastic process with diminishing rewards for risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, we consider an environment where non-durable consumption
 is both an expense and a potential risky position for a future jump in
 social ranking.
 In such an environment, the end goal of the consumer would be to simply
 maximise her wealth under the observed risk.
 As an example, education is an expense where less expenditure is guaranteed
 to disadvantage the individual - both because of how her value in the employmen
t market and how it shuts (or creates) opportunities for future rises in
 her income.
 The utility for education to the consumer therefore comprises both as value
 in the market after a future education and the probability of achieving
 success.
 If we observe only such expenses i.e.
 those which affect savings and increase the probability of wealth transition,
 then we can incorporate the insights from PT in the formulation of status
 consumption as a risky choice in consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a simple model of choice under uncertainty that we use, income occurs
 only directly through increases in wealth.
 As reference points are key to a PT formulation, we consider a scenario
 where two consumers compete for wealth differences relative to a common
 reference point.
 The conditions for such a game to have a incentive for both the rational
 consumers (rich and poor) under PT - necessitate the diminishing returns
 from taking too much risk (and disadvantages from taking too little risk).
 The use of PT also allows us to incorporate loss-aversion in consumer choice.
 The solution of the model is used to argue whether the presence of of risk-shar
ing in growing economies that are segmented by social class could have implicati
ons for status consumption.
 It is hoped that such a framework would help us answer if the consumer
 populations in two disparate economies may engage in an entirely different
 pattern of status consumption.

Status consumption was notably elaborated by Veblen

 in his 1899 treatise titled

.
 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods
 or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order
 to effectually mend the consumerâ€™s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advancements in game theory and statistics from the last century - particula
rly the theory of decision under risk - can explain some of the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour that Veblen had observed in the late
 19th century (see von Neumann-Morgenstern
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and Dhami

).
 While the effect that social conditions have on human behaviour still remains
 an area of research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, we argue that it is possible within the remit of the theory to view status
 consumption - i.e.
 the disproportionate spending on goods that only have a status (or visible)
 appeal - as an instance of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour.
 The two threads in the literature on status consumption which we have surveyed
 - first related to the behavioural approaches to life-cycle model and second
 related to the significance of social characteristics in visible consumption
 - can both be linked with this formulation of status.
 In linking the two threads, we rely on the intertemporal substitution problem
 - where a rational utility-optimising consumer balances between the non-durable
 and durable consumption based on her planned savings over her life-time
 (a problem often treated equivalent to the classical utility maximising
 consumption problem).

In first set of literature, a notable study is due to Shefrin-Thaler

 who seek a descriptive model for mental accounting (factors such as willpower)
 to explain observed trends in consumption.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice - where
 the consumer is subservient to her optimised plan for life-time savings
 and consumption - the representative consumer in a behavioural model is
 subject to overeating, overspending, accumulating items she doesn't need
 or acquiring habits she cannot afford (see Muellbauer

The second set of literature observes the demand on visible items across

 A key assumption made by such studies is that conspicuous consumption brings
 no utility in the regular sense (see Ireland

).
 The argument - often attributed to Veblen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 - allows one to consider the utility for visible consumption separable
 (additively) from the utility for non-visible consumption (we refer to
 this assumption as the futility assumption henceworth).
 The studies on visible consumption consistently find that segregated social
 groups (e.g.

 The role that industrial goods and income rises play in the addressing
 of status needs by the consumers (see Srinivas

 era.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas

 The empirical analyses based on such studies - however - have been of a
 limited scope due to the unobserved nature of some of the factors identified
 in the studies.

 - who motivate a case for a ranking order of status (so that the consumer
 always attempts to move herself up in the status order).
 In our adaptation of the intertemporal substitution problem, we view snob
 and bandwagon behaviours as the fundamental mechanisms for any status utility
 availed by the consumer
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor
 that they belong to a club that poor don't (invidious comparison).
 We have found Corneo's terminology more tractable for empirical analyses

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the presence of uncertainty related to wealth, the consumer's place
 in the status order can be viewed as the long-term security of the consumer
 from extreme fluctuations in her (higher) wealth.
 This is the sense in which status is usually interpreted in the studies
 in health and sociological sciences - which often track status as a vector
 of income, education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 However, a demand equation for status goods that considers status as a
 mere demographic vector ignores the dynamic nature of status and the demand
 for bandwagon items - which also influence the consumer's perception of
 status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status, being a social psychological concern, is observed only at the level
 of a social unit (individual or a reference group).
 So while a researcher observing a population of consumers may interpret
 status as the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk associated with the transition
 to the highest band of net-worth in the long-term - the consumer necessarily
 has a subjective view of her status.
 This subjective view of status is influenced by local factors that may
 be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

averaged out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at higher levels - what status means at the consumer's level may in fact
 even disagree with what status means at a higher societal-level.
 This is because the consumer's view of status would respond to the socio-politi
cal conditions that she perceives from within a particular social unit (family,
 community, ethnicity or region) than to the observed variables that are
 standardised over a larger area.
 The sense of status consumption is therefore necessarily localised at the
 consumer's social reference level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is only from a rather ontological perspective, that a high-status individual
 is someone who, in the long-term, has either or both of high income and
 a high (inter-generational) probability to move towards the high income
 group (stability).
 Let's call this the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of wealth transition (i.e.
 a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{ij}\}$
\end_inset

 representing the transition from wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) - which the researcher observes.
 A low-status individual - similarly - is someone who has either or both
 of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 Concerned with the long-term effect of such factors to the asset ownership
 and stability of income, while a researcher could assume that all consumers
 observe the same probability of transition to higher state of income, the
 consumer at local levels would in fact be motivated by the particular short-ter
m concerns with respect to the social unit that shape her view of status
 of others and her own self-image.
 Thus the uncertainty of wealth transition is observed at multiple levels
 in this subjective formulation of probability.
 The probability of material wealth transition that a consumer associates
 with the future is fundamentally subjective - although determined largely
 by factors related to social or regional identity.
 For the purposes of this discussion, we consider this latter sense as the
 consumer's 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability of wealth transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This subjective uncertainty is a mere restatement of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

peer-effects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that influence the consumer's decision.
 The consumer's assumed
\shape italic
 subjective 
\shape default
probability is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as her
 occupation, education, social or familial background, personality types
 etc.
 and is subject to change over the her lifetime.
 Since consumption is usually myopic, such a view would influence consumption
 at all times.
 Thus while the notion of status influence the risk-seeking behaviour of
 the consumer at local levels, the growth in the income and wealth of the
 consumer are constrained with long-term economic conditions (represented
 with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability).
 One may thus use the long-term ownership of assets observed over time as
 the sense of consumer's wealth which reconciles the respective subjective
 probability functions of all the consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a reconciliation is possible only because in the long-term there is
 no difference between the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probabilities.
 While the non-durable consumption of the consumers would be associated
 with their view in the short-term, in the long-term what matters is whether
 they have achieved a higher state of wealth (and thus status) or not.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider three consumers with different
 occupations in a small economy - an academic, a sportsperson and an investor
 - who all share the share the same reference point (by assumption) for
 wealth.
 They would all estimate the probability of doubling their wealth in the
 lifetime so that they may retire on the successful achievement of their
 goal.
 Given the nature of the profession, it is likely that the sportsperson
 overestimates the probability of her success until the middle of her career
 - after which the probability she associates to the success of doubling
 her wealth (if she hasn't already) would decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus a risk-seeking behaviour would be associated with a sportsperson much
 the way a risk-averse behaviour is associated with the academic who may
 be well aware of the limited probability of a windfall in the short-term.
 On the other hand, an investor may obtain a definite gain over a fixed
 term and have a risk-profile that lies somewhere in between that of the
 sportsperson and the academic.
 While the long-term decisions of the sportsperson may still be determined
 by the knowledge of expected income, a sportsperson would be characterised
 by a belief in an unlikely probability of success in the near-term in a
 way that is different from how an academic or an investor would foresee
 her future possible wealth transition.
 If we can assume that the three consumers have the same basic needs, it
 is unlikely that the consumption of the three individuals would be independent
 of how they view the transition probability of their monetary wealth in
 the near term.
 Still in the long-term it is only their success in monetary terms that
 would track their status.
 To state whether a risk-seeking consumer spends more or less on non-durable
 consumption we attempt to understand the consumer's goal in the intertemporal
 setting (where status consumption may appear to be less beneficial than
 saving for assets).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the above outline of a model, we can separate the consumer's choice
 that would impart varied degrees of certainty - the most certain choice
 being of a cash asset and the most uncertain choices being an unnecessary
 piece of jewelry.
 We represent the group of durable goods indicating a

\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 ) - which she utilises regardless of her risk-appetite.
 Thus a risk-seeking individual may get more utility from the non-durable
 consumption than the risk-averse individual (see Lowenstein-Prelec

 for the relation between loss-aversion and possessions).
 If the long-term assets can be considered as part of the wealth that can
 be passed on to generations, the short-term concerns of the consumer (which
 are influenced by the acquired wealth) are sensitive to the degree of risk-aver
sion
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The fulfilment of basic consumer needs itself carries no influence on status.
 Thus if we were to compare the consumption of a risk-seeking consumers
 with that of a risk-averse consumer, the consumption on needs would not
 have any role to play in the utility towards status relative to one another.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we associate non-durable consumption with the subjective probability,
 the status-related consumption (seen as high non-durable consumption) can
 be viewed as the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour in terms of the the
 
\shape italic

\shape default
and 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probabilities.
 Those who are hoping to enhance their social network or get ahead of others
 through signaling are likely to believe in a higher likelihood of their
 promotion to a higher status.
 A higher probability for the state promotion perceived by a risk-seeking
 consumer would thus result in a higher (subjective) weight for the same
 observed probability.
 Similarly, the perceived (weighted) probability of loss of one's status
 would be higher (e.g.
 that of the threat of immigration to one's personal wealth) than the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability in the long-term for a risk-averse consumer

The arguments for subjective probability that we use to develop our status

 A more formal treatment of subjective probability is offered by de Finetti

 and Savage
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 .
 The term personal probability (instead of perceived probability) is used
 by Savage to imply a probability associated with a consequence.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A probability weighting function can be chosen to represent the different
 weighting of observed probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, it is worthwhile to speak of the economic processes that
 are implied by an interplay of the two levels of uncertainties that we
 use to relate risk-aversion with consumption.
 One way to view the two uncertainties is as a delay or barriers in the
 flow of information related to risks in the consumer markets.
 When it comes to risks to the future wealth, the firms and institutions
 are often better equipped and more responsive than the individuals or small
 communities.
 The differences in subjective uncertainties and observed uncertainties
 matter only because of the differences in how information is consumed at
 different levels of societal organisation (e.g.
 at the level of consumption and at the level where incomes are distributed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a presence of barriers to information also indicates a limit to the
 free-market assumption of an autonomous consumer fully capable of addressing
 her true needs (see a discussion in Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Doyal-Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 There is little doubt that the differences in purchasing power between
 sections of a society and their desire for mobility can drive the consumption
 and the economy (see Smith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmithMoralSentiments"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 But the implicit assumption in the free market view of an exchange between
 the rich and poor sections driving economic progress is that the consumer
 has full information of the risks and incentives related to her wealth
 (i.e.
 the economy functions in a way that these risks are known to the consumer).
 If barriers to the flow of information the strength of institutions both
 undergo severe changes, this exchange may become less or more feasible
 (see Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Galbraith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GalbraithEssential,GalbraithAffluent"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Indeed such effects are more likely to be observed in the economies undergoing
 structural changes such as rapid industrialisation, higher advertising
 effects or increased centralisation of markets.
 So long as one may admit that the information about socio-economic changes
 is consumed at different speeds and extent amongst the consumers than firms
 then it must follow that the two consider the information of risks differently.
 The consumption in the short-term would thus always be influenced by asymmetrie
s in the observation of risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For these different levels of uncertainty to make any empirical sense however
 the subjective views of the consumer must be rationalised with the observed
 economic variables in the long run.
 The resources in an economy evolve as they are influenced by the actions
 taken on beliefs rather than beliefs themselves.
 In the long-run, the consumer beliefs reflect the changes in long-term
 assets by letting the risk-averse behaviours balance the risk-seeking behaviour
s participate in the same economy.
 Therefore we reconcile the consumers' subjective probability functions
 with an observed trajectory of wealth over a sufficiently long-period (
 this is implied with the properties of a probability weighting function
 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison with the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) can explain how
 this rationalisation of subjective probabilities could work in an intertemporal
 setting.
 The fundamental claim of the PIH is that income has a transitory and a
 permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional to the
 permanent component
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 Unlike with PIH, however we do not use the assumption of the independence
 (zero-correlation) between the transitory component and the permanent component
 - a condition far stronger than what is required to rationalise the subjective
 views.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equivalent to the PIH's zero-correlation assumption is the reconciliation
 of the subjective probabilities with the observed probability in a stochastic
 process representing the evolution of wealth over time.
 We treat the items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 as a part of consumer wealth while the items that cannot be passed on are
 considered short-term.
 In other words, the observed probability is contributed to by only the
 assets transferred between generations in the long-run - there is little
 more than the net asset worth of the individual and the personal characteristic
s (such as social class) that are passed over as inheritance to the progeny.
 On the other hand, the subjective probability of success through social
 interactions and the high quality consumption associated with it need not
 matter in the long-term - since the path to net asset worth may completely
 ignore the non-durable consumption habits of the past - except for what
 translates into possession of long-term wealth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike with a permanent income approach the two uncertainties are thus not
 expected to be independent of each other but are reconciled by the transfer
 and ownership of long-term assets in the economy.
 Contrasting with PIH - which observes the dispersion in income amongst
 socio-economic classes (gauged with a simple variance in past income) as
 a measure of risk - we also wish to include the effect of the dispersion
 in quality of consumption and wealth owing to social hierarchy in consumer
 choice.
 Thus unlike PIH, we do not explicitly ignore the role of

 (which can be incorporated in PIH), status-related consumption is an aberration
 if the consumer is meant to always achieve the goal of improving her wealth
 by minimising the volatility of income streams.
 If conspicuous consumption were truly futile, then there would be no way
 for the rational consumer to derive any utility from status-related consumption.
 The explicit subjective uncertainty - represented with a probability weighting
 function - models the advantage one receives from status consumption and
 allows the representative consumer to deviate from her long-term plans.
 The idea that a consumer may deviate from her long-term plans is a paradigm
 often used in the behavioural implementations of life-cycle methods.
 Here a particularly relevant approach is provided by Thaler et al

 were rational.
 In the context of status consumption which we are concerned with, the mere
 existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there is some utility
 to be derived by spending on what is not rationally advantageous to the
 consumer in the long-term

 Focusing on excess non-durable consumption and wealth, our approach does

 consumption but includes it in a wider concern for status and growth in

\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our view of status consumption as simply the excess non-durable consumption
 could appear incongruous with how conspicuous consumption is usually presented
 in the public discourse i.e.
 as a phenomenon that only-serves-the-rich.
 Generally speaking, we view a conspicuous item as one that can be used
 both to distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of
 those above oneself, but there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness
 amongst the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 If one could admit a definition of status consumption as a means to distinguish
 oneself from one's own reference group and agree that everyone does belong
 to a particular reference group, then it follows that everyone can benefit
 from status consumption (i.e.
 a probabilistic improvement of the consumer's perceived status can be achieved
 with status consumption).
 Further, if the long-term consumption is defined as assets that stay the
 same over many generations (so that all else is considered non-durable)
 then a focus on non-durable consumption may sufficiently capture the sense
 of conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of significant wealth differences, another reason to object
 to the view of status consumption as a consumption exclusive to the rich
 is that the utility to the rich from status consumption might be quite
 little given that the rich consumer already has enough to distance herself
 from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have
 anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave
 anyone behind).
 Instead, one could argue that even the poorest may want to indicate that
 they are not the poorest - much the way richest may want it to be known
 to the others that they are indeed the richest

 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 may in fact be needed by both the rich and the poor.
 Indeed everyone else in the middle (i.e.
 those who are neither the richest nor the poorest) must also try to avoid
 getting poorer and try to become the richest at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, our approach for status consumption - similar to those used
 in the studies on visible consumption - is one that views a consumer's
 net utility from status consumption as a combination of private utility
 (subjective) and public utility (observed through rise in wealth).
 Where it differs fundamentally is in its treatment of uncertainty - establishin
g a relationship between the extreme wealth differences and the upside risk
 with consumption.
 Formulating status consumption as uncertainty associated with the future
 states of wealth and the utility from status consumption as a probabilistic
 private utility, we use prospect theory (PT) to understand a competition
 for status.
 A key difference from the approach taken in much of the literature on visible
 consumption is therefore that the status utility from such consumption
 is not futile in a material sense.
 Indeed a luxury watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared
 to its cheaper alternatives that offer the same functionality i.e.
 that of telling the current time) but if an aspiring businessman uses his
 knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business, then
 the futile consumption may probabilistically translate into a material
 advantage.
 The promise of social mobility is indeed the core appeal of status consumption.
 Items like luxury watches are in fact important only because the rich flock
 around them 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indeed if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile - a sense that our model is not concerned with.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We argue that the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may offer
 is important to the consumer as it acts as a means of connecting the rich
 with the not-so rich in the long-term.
 Further, the consumption of status item is driven by a small chance of
 success - a probability which the risk-seeking (risk-averse) consumer is
 likely to overestimate (underestimate).
 In the long-term one must reconcile the subjective probabilities with an
 observed wealth process - as only a few of the purchasers of luxury watches
 would improve their self-image and enhance their social networks to achieve
 material wealth - others would remain mere purchasers.

\begin_layout Standard
A typical inter-temporal model of substitution between savings and consumption
 relies on observed income, savings, an interest rate of growth as well
 as depreciation/discounting factor.
 Following this approach, if consumption could be split into certain and
 uncertain parts, then one could associate the two with the observed and
 subjective probabilities.
 More particularly, one could argue that the growth of the consumer's income
 process is independent of the subjective uncertainty (higher probability
 to landing in a state of higher status than what is known through more
 deterministic trends of income) which influences the non-durable consumption.
 Still, a key factor with such a formulation is the assumed depreciation
 (or discount factor) and a growth-rate associated with the wealth.
 The literature in fact often uses a discounting based on education and
 social classes or other demographic variables (see Cagetti
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CagettiWealth2003"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that the presence of an exogenous interest rate or a depreciation
 factor assumes too much about the consumer expectations for wealth whose
 relationship with consumption we wish to understand.
 Indeed the ideas of depreciation and interest-rate were themselves are
 based on elaborate behavioural arguments for consumer impatience and opportunit
y from early last century (see Fisher
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherInterest1930"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As we set ourselves to model the consumer impatience and perceived risk
 with more recent theories for impatience, we assume no exogenous depreciation
 and interest rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this simple model, we consider two consumers who compete with relative
 wealth (assets) and relative non-durable consumption so that the their
 evaluation of future risks may affect their choice.
 The depreciation of wealth in the model is in fact only through direct
 expenditure - which in turns consists only of consumption or investment.
 Needs don't offer status advantage to either of the consumer in the model
 while a higher non-durable consumption offers a probabilistic advantage.
 As the advantage from nondurable consumption is probabilistic, the consumer
 doesn't choose to spend all wealth on non-durable consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain the implications of an explicit modeling of uncertainty in consumer
 choice, we contrast two approaches - one where the growth of wealth is
 deterministic and the other where the evolution of wealth is a stochastic
 process evaluated by the consumer.
 As detailed in the sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Stochastic"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the two models differ in how consumer's effort or investment relates to
 the payoff in every period.
 The first (non-stochastic case) considers a certain payoff for effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and thus a deterministic path to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 while the stochastic case considers a risky payoff (and an uncertain path
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $A)$
\end_inset

 for a given non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that the latter (stochastic) approach may offer an instance closer
 to the real world since it is in evaluating a future path to higher-wealth
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) where status competitions develop.
 In this latter (stochastic) case, the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 effectively determines the risk the consumer takes towards the future state
 of wealth.
 A more risk-seeking individual is thus meant to have an increased non-durable
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 As the payoff in every period is risky, the non-durable consumption also
 mirrors the perception of risk with the future asset (this is because any
 consumption that is not non-durable adds towards wealth in the model).
 This is explained in more detail in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Stochastic"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising again that since we're considering utility from
 relative non-durable consumption, the needs of the consumer have no role
 to play in the utility as needs are meant to be common across both the
 consumers by definition.
 The claim that the consumption above needs represents consumers risk in
 the stochastic case is the equivalent of the claim in the non-stochastic
 case that a consumer competes with others with both non-durable consumption
 and wealth.
 Another simplifiying assumption we make is that the consumers in the model
 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dynasties
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which observe a risky growth of wealth.
 The effect of family size and of life-cycle are therefore ignored in the
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also compare how the two models would behave under the assumption that
 extreme wealth differences are not sustainable in a society and necessitate
 an income redistribution (e.g.
 taxation).
 The key question we wish to answer with the model is whether the risk-averse
 consumers may settle for less status consumption when competing with those
 having higher wealth possession or not.

Non-Stochastic Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a non-stochastic case, consider two consumers 1 and 2 who compete with
 each other for the assets they possess.
 A degenerate case would be one where each consumer has a certain wealth
 level but with no other option other than bearing a cost/depreciation on
 her wealth account e.g.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\Delta A}{A}=-k$
\end_inset

.
 If utility is only achieved from wealth, then clearly she would have no
 incentive to raise this rate of decline with more consumption so as to
 prolong the lifetime of the wealth she possesses.
 If we have two consumers who both observe each other's wealth then too,
 the consumer has no incentive to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 from its minimum possible value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degenerate case is of no practical use for status consumption as there
 is no incentive for the rational poorer consumer to participate in the
 competition.
 To provide some incentive to the poorer consumer (lower wealth account
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ) for her to participate in the game, we can introduce an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 from consumer's effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

.
 Now the poorer consumer gets to change the destiny of her wealth as she
 gets an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\xi$
\end_inset

 for effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and hopes to bridge gap between wealth accounts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without any natural decline or growth with the wealth, we can also introduce
 a cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 associated with a wealth account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 so that the consumer with higher wealth bears a higher absolute cost included
 in the non-durable consumption.
 This makes sense since the more wealth one has the task of maintaining
 wealth bears some costs as well.
 Consider now the dynamics of wealth for two consumers in this no-uncertainty
 model with income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{t})$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
A_{t+1,1}=A_{t,1}-\delta(A_{t,1}+\pi\xi_{1})+\pi\xi_{1}\nonumber \\
A_{t+1,2}=A_{t,2}-\delta(A_{t,2}+\pi\xi_{2})+\pi\xi_{2}\label{eq:dynamics_expenditure}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without loss of generality, let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 As long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi>1$
\end_inset

, the consumer 1 would increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1,t+1}/A_{2,t+1}$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer 2 would similarly maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2,t+1}/A_{1,t+1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the game is to end at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, then the consumer 2 must always choose a 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not occur before time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, if the consumers only cared about relative wealth then
 there is no reason for the consumer 2 to allow 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}$
\end_inset

 before 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the consumer 1 would like to achieve 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 as soon as possible instead of having to wait until 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The equilibrium state of such a game is when either 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 or when 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}\ge0$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is maintained as desired by consumer 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without a cost function with a steep upward rise in cost for the richer
 consumer such a game would not be too different from the degenerate case
 as it offers no incentive to the poorer consumer.
 Another possibility to make the game feasible is to consider that the consumers
 don't actually optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively but the combinations 
\begin_inset Formula $(\xi_{1},A_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\xi_{2},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 instead.
 After all in the real world we judge those around us not just by their
 wealth but by what they do with their wealth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That could indeed make the game worthwhile to play for both the consumers.
 There are two fundamental ways to include the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

) in the view of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 First is to let an explicit combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,A$
\end_inset

 in a loglinear or a similar form (so that there is some substitution between
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 both within period and across periods i.e.
 the intertemporal substitution).
 The second way is to view either just 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

( or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) adjusted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 respectively).
 It could be for example argued that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is all that is visible and is competed with - so that there is a fair game
 to play between consumer 1 and 2.
 The wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may still matter but only in providing the upper bound for 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 (poorer consumer cannot afford too much 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

).
 This is an approach similar to what is followed in some of the literature
 on visible consumption.
 Indeed when the differences in wealth are high, a fair game based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 alone may not be plausible (the poor consumer's 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is not going to be of much relative value).
 In such a case, we cannot ignore the role that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 plays.
 This is why we seek a game considering 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which

 of reference point in the above equation.
 We assume that the reference point is between

\end_inset

 and choose a geometric mean

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and

A fundamental limitation of the above model is that the difference in wealth
 accounts can grow wider without any recourse.
 For the two consumers to continue with the game it makes sense to allow
 an income redistribution so that a fixed proportion of the total wealth
 difference is given to the poor consumer.
 In a simple extension of the the model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 above, we introduce a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 on relative wealth which is transferred to the poorer consumer.
 The dynamics in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

A_{t+1,2}=A_{2}-\delta(A_{t,2}+\pi\xi_{2}-\tau(A_{2}-A_{1}))+\pi\xi_{2}-\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})\nonumber

\begin_layout Standard
It can be verified that the amount

\end_inset

 transferred to the poorer consumer reduces to 0 when both the consumers
 achieve the same wealth (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 This is particularly interesting when utility is derived both from 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - as it gives the dynamics the characteristics of a zero sum game.
 With such a redistribution in place, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $>A_{1}$

 then the consumer might want to keep

Stochastic Case

\begin_layout Standard
As we have argued before - the assumption of wealth depreciating or rising
 at a constant rate is too limiting for the purpose of modeling the effect
 on uncertainty on consumer choice.
 To represent a scenario closer to the real-world, we consider an uncertainty
 both in the consumer's perception of her future wealth and that in the
 path followed by wealth.
 The perception of the consumer is represented with a probability weighting
 function

 A wealthy individual in the model does not just silently earn interest
 on income - but has to compete with others who are acquiring new wealth
 by investing into newer areas.
 Competing with others and guarding one's wealth, the consumer has no choice
 but to bet on uncertain pursuits in order for her to grow her wealth

 wealth have full information of the new wealth opportunities (full information

 the risk-seeking individuals and risk-averse individuals.

\begin_layout Standard
In the stochastic formulation, the consumer's intertemporal choice is viewed
 as a simple lottery scheme.
 As the consumer's investments (i.e.
 consumption which is indistinguishable from needs) are hoped to increase
 the asset in some way, the expectation of growth in one's assets is embedded
 in the expenditure one makes.
 Anything that is not expended contributes to the saving towards wealth
 for the consumer.
 Over generations the wealth can either decline significantly or grow in
 value due to the strategy adopted by the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since staying in an elite non-durable consumption club offers only a probabilist
ic benefit, we represent the consumer's choice as one amognst many lotteries.
 The examples for such an expenditure would be a club membership or expertise
 in conspicuous items which might eventually get the consumer in the rich
 club over generations albeit with a low probability.
 The various lotteries available to the consumer could range from a secure
 cash savings to a balanced strategy of spending towards education in the
 hope for income rise over years or a bet on an expensive club membership
 in a hope for relevant social connections.
 Note the consumer's own risk-profile always influences the selection of
 a particular lottery.
 In other words, the same observed probability may be considered too risky
 or not risky enough for consumers with different degrees of risk-aversion
 (a feature that is modeled with the probability weighting function

Using prospect theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 we elaborate a utility function that evaluates the various lotteries for
 a consumer.
 Any given lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is seen as a sequence of payoffs 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $u(L)=\sum_{i}w(p_{i})\upsilon(x_{i})$

 (
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 is the probability weighting function and 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(x)$
\end_inset

 is the payoff-utility function for the consumer).
 If we assign probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 to the various options 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 distributed with a known distribution function to the consumer, we can
 assess the relative importance of the options to the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not having assumed a depreciation or an interest-based growth with the wealth
 account allows us to attribute the growth or depreciation in the wealth
 account to the consumer's perceived uncertainty in an environment of risky
 future growth for wealth.
 To accentuate the uncertainty in the growth of wealth, consider a gold
 rush economy where more digging increases the chances of getting a higher
 wealth.
 This is comparable to finding new wealth in an economy - where luck favours
 the prepared.
 Except through consumption, there is no inherent depreciation assumed for
 the wealth.
 This means that an immense wealth would deplete only with a high rate of
 consumption.
 It also means that if a consumer makes no new investments (search for gold)
 the competing consumers might find more wealth leading to her relative
 poverty in the economy.
 Both consumption and investment - which are indistinguishable empirically
 - are represented as one variable

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net effect of investments

 It is worth noting that in contrast with the non-stochastic approach, the
 consumer utility under risk is fundamentally different from the utility
 derived without risk (see Shoemaker

 The PT utility dictates that the behaviour of a risk-seeking consumer would
 be different in the stochastic model from that of a risk-averse consumer.
 More particularly, a consumer is allowed to have an irrational expectation
 of closing the wealth gap in the stochastic model whereas the non-stochastic
 utility model implied that a consumer with lower wealth could always get
 the same overall utility as a consumer with higher wealth if their consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 Given the limited supported for expected-value maximisation in behavioural

 a utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{t+1})$

The simplest of such cases are those where

 is enhanced with some risk-aversion parameters (see Sharpe 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 It follows with the function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{t+1})$
\end_inset

 that a a risk neutral consumer making a one-time decision on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 based on a time horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 would choose a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{CE}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $X_{t\in[1,T]}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))=u(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 is maximised.
 A risk-seeking consumer would choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{CE}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{CE}))=u(A_{CE})$
\end_inset

 The consumer choosing

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E($

\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T}))>E(u(A_{CE}))$
\end_inset

 is considered risk-seeking and the consumer selecting 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))<E(u(A_{CE}))$
\end_inset

 would be considered risk-averse.
 If we use a CRRA utilty to illustrate this further, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\frac{A^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 leading to 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 being maximised when 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 is maximised with 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi:(\frac{d\sigma}{d\psi}=\frac{1}{p(1-p)})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d\sigma}{d\psi}>0$
\end_inset

).
 The measure of risk-aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 in the CRRA function is essentially a measure of the curvature of a value
 function.
 If every consumer optimises 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 then consumer has no reason to deviate from the maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A_{T})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is unlikely to represent a real-world scenario.
 Firstly, the consumer derives utility also from consumption (which we have
 already noted).
 Secondly, there is little evidence in support of the consumer preference
 following a CRRA or CARA type utility (see Dhami

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 - it is that wealth under a perceived uncertainty is controlled only through
 consumption (or investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 This represents a particular situation of uncertainty in growth of wealth
 such that i) wealth declines only through consumption (risk) and ii) the
 consumption (risk taken) is fully under control of the consumer.
 We can thus view the differences caused by the degrees of risk-aversion
 if we assume a diminishing returns for a risky gain 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$

\begin_layout Standard
Using PT allows us to incorporate the desired feature where not every consumer
 has same response to the same

probability of growth in wealth.
 To model the attitude towards risk, we consider a weighting of probability
 to differentiate the risk-seeking behaviour from the risk-averse behaviour.
 Also since we let the consumption and investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 track the perceived uncertainty in the stochastic dynamics, we no longer
 need to worry about the combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 The combined utility of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{A\in\mathscr{A}}\upsilon(A)w(P(A))$

 Keeping the Bernoulli setting with probability

Other than the non-linear effect of probability, wherein a risk-averse individua
l could see the same opportunity differently from a risk-seeking individual
 (a risk-neutral individual would simply observer 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)=p$
\end_inset

), the above approach also has another property which is of a descriptive
 importance.
 It is that the utility also represents the loss-aversion in wealth (i.e.
 the consumer dislikes losses more than she likes profits).

 risk-aversion

The PT approach also permits us to include the cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 from the non-stochastic approach (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is a vector of relevant personal characteristics) as an investment towards
 the higher probability of a windfall.
 In other words, if success were a lottery, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 would be the cost to be paid to take part in the lottery.
 This cost may rise steeply as the rich gets richer.
 In the stochastic model, the cost of participation is part of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 which is paid to improve the likelihood of change in wealth.
 So the individual receives the higher likelihood of wealth change only
 after an upfront asset bearing cost 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 is paid.
 Thus the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t,}\rho)$
\end_inset

 in non-stochastic model is included in the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 in the stochastic model.
 Whether a risk-seeking consumer pays more wealth-bearing costs (or less)
 than a risk-averse - would depend on the overall effect of wealth as well
 as the social stratum.

Notice that the probability weighting function plays no direct role in the
 dynamics (i.e.
 evolution of wealth account

 Note also that an optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is sought for the two consumers based on the assumption that the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is observed by the consumers (this assumption can be relieved the case
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}\ne\sigma_{2}$
\end_inset

 In a population with more than two consumers, it remains to be seen if
 a certain mixture of risk-averse and risk-seeking individuals exist can
 enable a risk-sharing amongst groups of consumers.

Much the same way with the non-stochastic case, one could see the need for
 an income redistribution if through a stroke of luck, the consumer 1 becomes
 much richer than consumer 2 (event 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Unlike in the non-stochastic case, however, the two consumers would choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 based not only on the basis of the actual uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 but also their own degree of risk-aversion ( 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 In other words, the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 depends on both the degree of risk-aversion and relative wealth (distance

While we have assumed a Bernoulli distribution for 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

, a real-world scenario may depend on how the properties (unobserved) like
 creativity, talent or luck are distributed in the population.
 In the much extreme example of the goldrush economy, the distribution of
 gold in the land is all that matters.
 Assuming that such a distribution is known we could have a situation when
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<<A_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 might decide to exchange her different services where she takes very little
 risk and just gets an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 from the consumer.
 The income to redistributed can still be seen as a proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 and the income arrangement would be non-existent if the two individuals
 had the same level of assets:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
u_{1}(\psi_{1})=\frac{p^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t,1}-\delta\psi_{1}+\sigma(\psi_{1})-A'+\tau(A_{t,2}-A_{t,1}-\delta(\psi_{2}-\psi_{1})+\sigma(\psi_{2})-\sigma(\psi_{1})))\\
+\frac{(1-p)^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t,1}-\delta\psi_{1}-A'+\tau(A_{t,2}-A_{t,1}-\delta(\psi_{2}-\psi_{1}))\\
u_{2}(\psi_{2})=\frac{p^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t,2}-\delta\psi_{2}+\sigma(\psi_{2})-A'-\tau(A_{t,2}-A_{t,1}-\delta(\psi_{2}-\psi_{1})+\sigma(\psi_{2})-\sigma(\psi_{1})))\\

The equilibria would now depend on the stochastic term as well.
 The risk-taking indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (which in empirical studies would amount to non-durable consumption inclusive
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

investments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is therefore shared between the two consumers with different risk-profiles.
 The conclusions of the model could help us refine how redistribution policies
 such as taxation might allow an equilibrium for risk-seeking and risk-averse
 individuals to exist.
 This is relevant for status consumption since the risk-sharing across groups
 segmented by social strata, occupation or class - would imply that status
 consumption is not necessarily important when the class differences are
 strong.
 Indeed an income-sharing arrangement does influence status consumption
 through the risk-sharing as well.
 This is the refinement that we had sought for understanding how wealth
 differences affect status consumption.

A desirable feature of the above framework is that it also endogenises social
 characteristics vector as the consumer's notion of subjectivity.

 Despite carrying the same

economic
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 would associate a higher subjective probability with a certain characteristics

 Modeling subective probability is therefore a nature first step to incorporatin
g social characteristics in the intertemporal.
 It is also implied that to consider an empirical case for the model with

The Equation

 with arithmetic Brownian shows how critical the selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 would be if a normal distribution of wealth changes were assumed.
 In the real-world, the choice of the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 may depend very much on the nature of economy.
 As such, the inheritable wealth would decline in value when it's not invested
 in any growing economy.
 In a declining economy (consider depletion of gold in our example), even
 though wealth may depreciate slower it would still keep the consumer's
 relative advantage to others and the consumers would continue to form an
 expectation of increased future wealth just the same.
 It can be argued that wealth in the economy is important not only because
 of the purchasing power but fundamentally due to the social order in the
 form of an expectation held by other participants in the economy that they
 can replicate the success of the wealthy by acting as participants in the
 economy 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the presence of social stratification, such expectations would be segmented
 across social groups.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The nature of the distribution would thus be independent of the state of
 the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that the selection of a distribution is best left for the empirical
 data to dictate - particularly since the choice of risk is hardly one-dimension
al in any real-life scenario.
 At any point, a consumer takes multiple risks by distributing her consumption
 across multiple commodities.
 In a developing economy, basic education may be a high-risk / high-reward
 expenditure if it is sparingly available, but it may be fairly low-risk
 low-reward expenditure in a developed country with state-supported education.
 The expected upside risks with selection of residential neighborhood may
 similarly be fairly low-risk low-reward in densely populated areas but
 low-risk high-reward in rural areas.
 The task to represent all risks the consumers takes in a given economy
 as a one-dimensional random variable is one that may require critical assumptio
ns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key feature of the model is that it allows us to compare status consumption
 in a developed economy with that in a developing economy.
 From the point of view of the consumer's perception of risk - which the
 model incorporates - the most relevant difference between the developing
 countries and the developed countries is that of the strength of welfare
 institutions.
 In a developed economy, the state institutions intervene when market forces
 aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertakings or to distribut
e items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world - often failing to provide incentives to the private enterprise
 for distribution of public goods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 This has implications for status consumption.
 Consider basic education - which may be of status importance in the developing
 economy in a way that it isn't in the developed economy.
 This is primarily because the distribution of education (and other similar
 assets that may be public goods) is state-assisted in a developed country
 and the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny is lowered.
 Thus, the extent to which education may eventually matter towards status
 in the developed economy depends on how consumers set themselves apart
 in the social order based on other means of signaling status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), the expected growth
 from education is higher (observed probability).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relating inter-generational mobility with status consumption allows us to
 endogenise the role of social characteristics in the population as well.
 In the presence of social segregation or extreme wealth differences, the
 formulation can help answer whether the visible consumption identified
 through surveys can sufficiently capture the concern for status consumption
 or not.
 The uncertainty-based framework can also be used to understand the net
 impact of taxation on the  indirect risk-sharing - which is implied with
 the presence of long-term wealth-differences.
\end_layout

A possible criticism of the approach may be our assumption that the basic
 consumer needs are always met for the consumers.
 This however could be easily addressed by constraining the choice for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 in the stochastic model - by enforcing the risk-aversion of those whose
 basic needs are not met (forcing them to address basic needs and add very
 little as

investments

).

The constraint of observed risk (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

) being the same for all consumers could be in relieved a future extension
 of the model - since the intergenerational mobility in a real economy tends
 to vary across regions.
 The regional variations would imply necessarily that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 for one consumer be different from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 for another.
 It could also be argued that the players in an economy can also influence
 the known risks of each other (see the discussion on information barriers
 and delay in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:LiteratureReview"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 This too could be permitted with a dynamic process for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The scope of the current chapter, however, has been to specify the necessary
 refinement needed for the definition of status consumption in the presence
 of extreme wealth and social/spatial segregation.
