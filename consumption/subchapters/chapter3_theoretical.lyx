\begin_layout Title
Status as uncertainty in consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is derived based on the framework for intertempor
al consumption choice in the presence of long-term assets.
 Status is endogenised as states of financial stability and included as
 part of the consumer's utility in the intertemporal model for substitution
 between quality in non-durable consumption and savings for future assets.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main question is if a separating equilibrium can exist between two consumers
 with differing risk-aversion behaviour and known to have a PT behavior
 as they observe a common stochastic process with diminshing rewards for
 risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
If consumers optimised status with both non-durable consumption, If the
 end goal of the consumer was to maximise her wealth where non-durable consumpti
on was both and expense and a risky jump in social ranking.
 Consider education - where less expenditure guaranteed to disadvantage.
 Education is both an expense and investment.
 If we observe only such expenses i.e.
 those which affect savings but also increase the wealth by a certain probabilit
y.
 This increase is only a proxy of increase in status which would increase
 the income in a more realistic model.
 In this simple model, there is no income and therefore investments increase
 with a certain probability as if wealth too increased.
 Since the rich have something to lose in this game the know that by not
 taking too much risk i.e.
 by lowering 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, they would lose out on the risk.
 As the rich are loss-averse, they would also like to keep their rich position.
 These are endognised in a model.
 Status consumption - in the general sense that Veblen had talked about
 - includes educations and should be viewed as this risky investment.
 The model of risk-sharing is obviously more general and applies to industrial
 organisation and politics as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The studies on conspicuous consumption tend to explore a specific instance
 of status consumption.
 Here, conspicuous consumption is expected to occur through a certain type
 of (visible) goods that are meant to be futile for the general needs of
 the consumer.
 This assumption allows us to use to the separability of demand for visible
 goods.
 Before we can assume that much of status consumption occurs through visible
 commodities (clothing, shoes, jewelry etc.) in the developing economies,
 we revisit the framework of demand with a consideration of risk associated
 with the promotion through social rank advancement so as to view status
 consumption in a more general context.
 While such a model might does not benefit from the tractability that the
 models for visible consumption benefit from, the inclusion of the estimates
 of wealth of the consumer (e.g.
 asset ownership in consumer data), if available, may provide some necessary
 insights into status consumption by observe how quality across commodities
 is consumed with respect to the wealth of the consumer.

Such a framework helps us answer if the consumers in one economy may engage
 in status consumption more than they do in another.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 to effectually mend the consumerâ€™s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

The advancements in game theory and statistics from the last century - particula
rly the theory of decision under risk - can explain some of the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour that Veblen had observed in the late
 19th century.
 The effect that social conditions have on human behaviour remains an area
 of active research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"

\end_inset

.
 However, the theory of decision under risk (see von Neumann-Morgenstern
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VonNeumannMorgenstern1944"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) has successfully explained many of the apparent paradoxes in human behaviour
 (see Dhami 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 It is possible - within the remit of this theory - to view status consumption
 i.e.
 the disproportionate spending on goods that only have a status (or visible)
 appeal as an instance of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour.
 We inherit from the literature on habit formation and visible consumption
 while adopting this approach to status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature from behavioural economics, marketing research and development
 economics all seem to concur on the tendencies of habit formation in consumer
 behaviour.
 The measurement of changes in habits and quality has a long tradition in
 neoclassical economics (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment of the problem).
 Of particular interest is the model for myopia amongst consumers described
 by Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who had noted the significance of lagged consumption on aggregate consumption.
 The life-cycle model used by Muellbauer has been of considerable importance
 in more recent studies on consumption where a rational utility-optimising
 consumer balances between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned savings over her life-time i.e.
 in an intertemporal substitution setting (a problem often treated equivalent
 to the classical utility maximising consumption problem).
 Improving upon the classical approach where the consumer is subservient
 to her optimised plan for life-time savings and consumption, a few behavioural
 approaches (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for example) have sought descriptive models for mental accounting and factors
 such as willpower to better understand the development of habits in consumers.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice, the
 representative consumer in such models is subject to overeating, overspending,
 accumulating items she doesn't need or acquiring habits she cannot afford.

The literature from sociological studies has long indicated the role that
 industrial goods and income rises play in addressing of status needs by
 the consumers (see Srinivas

 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (referred to as

 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 Elsewhere too, rapid industrialisation has created a disproportionate change
 in lifestyles with a crowding effect towards urbanisation (see https://www.dukeu
press.edu/lifebuoy-men-lux-women).
 A quantiative analysis of such works has been of limited scope - particularly
 becuse of unobserved nature of identified factors in many of such studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent literature on conspicuous consumption focuses on a particular instnace
 of status consumption i.e.
 conscpicuous consumption which is assumed to bring no utility in the regular
 sense (see Ireland

, Hopkins-Kornienko

).
 The argument - often attributed to Veblen allows one to consider the utility
 for visible consumption separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (we refer to this assumption as the futility assumption henceworth).
In the current chapter, we we follow a slightly different approach based
 on the intertemporal substitution problem - where we introduce snob and
 bandwagon behaviour as the fundamental mechanisms for any status utility.
 This allows us to include wealth differences and quality in an intertemporal
 setting - where the competing behaviours of snob and bandwagon items are
 subject to the uncertainty perceived by the consumer
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor
 that they belong to a club that poor don't (invidious comparison).
 We have found Corneo's terminology more tractable for empirical analyses

\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such an uncertainty-based notion of status can be seen a state of wealth
 representing the long-term security of the consumer from extreme income
 fluctuations.
 This is the sense in which status is interpreted in health and sociological
 sciences literature - which often track status with a vector of income,
 education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 However, a demand equation for status goods that considers status as a
 mere demograhic vector ignores the dynamic nature of status and bandwagon
 items.
 Status is a social psychological concern and is often observed at the level
 of a social unit (individual or a reference group).
 So while a researcher observing a population of consumers may interpret
 the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk associated with the transition
 to the highest band of net-worth in the long-term as status, the consumer
 necessarily has a subjective view of her status which is influenced by
 locacl factors averaged out at highe leelss.
 
\bar under
The two perspectives may 
\bar default
not need to disagree, but the consumer's view of status could consider the
 socio-political conditions which she perceives from within a particular
 social unit (family, community, ethnicity or region) more important than
 what an economist us concerned wtth.
 A vuew if status onsumption is necessarily localised (tied to reference
 level) - where socio-cultural factors matter more than the observed variables
 that are standardised over a large area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the long-term, a high-status individual is someone who has either or
 both of high income and a high (inter-generational) probability to move
 towards the high income group (stability).
 Let's call this the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of wealth transition (i.e.
 a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{ij}\}$
\end_inset

 representing the transition from wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) - which the researcher observes.
 A low-status individual - similarly - is someone who has either or both
 of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 The researcher - concerned with the long-term effect of such factors to
 the asset ownership and stability of income - may assume that all consumers
 observe the same probability of transition to higher state of income but
 the consumer would be motivated by the particular short-term concerns with
 respect to the social unit that influence her view of status and self-image.
 Thus the uncertainty of wealth transition is observed at multiple levels
 in this subjective formulation of probability.
 The probability of material wealth transition that a consumer associates
 with the future is fundamentally subjective - although determined largely
 by factors related to social or regional identity.
 For the purposes of this discussion, we consider this latter sense as 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability of wealth transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that status consumption (other than the standardised variables)
 depends on a 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 (personal) uncertainty one attaches to possible future states of wealth
 and use the decision theory framework to understand status consumption
 as a choice of excess non-durable consumption vs long-term ownership of
 assets.
 The consumer's 
\shape italic
subjective 
\shape default
probability is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as her
 occupation, education, social or familial background, personality types
 etc.
 and is subject to change over the her lifetime.
 Since consumption is usually myopic, such a view would influence consumption
 at all times.
 The notion of status, self-reference and peer effects all influence the
 risk-seeking behaviour of the consumer which are captured in the consumer's
 subjective probability function

If 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\{(x_{i},p_{i})\}$

 s.t.

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

, risk-seeking behaviour is exhibited for a consumer who values the prospect

\begin_inset Formula $E(L)=\sum p_{i}x_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The risk-averse behaviour is expected when the prospect is valued lower
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $E(L)$
\end_inset

.
 It is well known that the consumers don't behave according to the expected
 (concave) utility.
 To separate the effect of uncertainty on decision making from the effect
 of payoffs in a non-concave utility function, one often views the utility
 as a product of the consumer's utility for payoffs 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(x)$
\end_inset

 and probability weighting function 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 so that they act according to 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(L))=\sum w(p_{i})\upsilon(x_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)=p$
\end_inset

 leads one back to the expected utility case.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability.
 On the other hand, the growth in the income and wealth of the consumer,
 unlike the subjective probability which drives consumption in the near
 term, are constrained with long-term economic conditions and can be assumed
 to be associated with a different probability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that in the long-term there is no difference between
 the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probabilities.
 So while the non-durable consumption of the consumers would be associated
 with their view in the short-term, in the long-term what matters are whether
 they have achieved a higher state of wealth (and thus status) or not.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider three consumers with different
 occupations in a microeconomy - an academic, a sportsperson and an investor
 - who all share the share the same reference point (by assumption) for
 wealth.
 They all estimate the probability of doubling their wealth in the lifetime
 so that they may retire on the successful achievement of their goal.
 Given the nature of the profession, it is likely that the sportsperson
 overestimates the probability of her success until the middle of her career
 - after which the probability she associates to the success of doubling
 her wealth (if she hasn't already) would decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus a risk-seeking behaviour would be associated with a sportsperson much
 the way a risk-averse behaviour is associated with the academic who may
 be well aware of the limited probabilty of a windfall in the short-term.
 On the other hand, an investor may be after a definite gain over a fixed
 term and have a risk-profile that lies somewhere in between that of the
 sportperson and the academic.
 While the long-term decisions of the sportsperson may still be determined
 by the knowledge of expected income, a sportsperson would be characteristised
 by the belief in an unlikely probability of success in the near-term in
 a way that is different from how an academic or an investor would foresee
 her wealth transition.
 If we can assume that the three consumers have the same basic needs, it
 is extremely unlikely that the consumption of the three individuals would
 be independent of how they view the transition probability of their monetary
 wealth in the near term.
 Still in the long-term is only their success in montery terms that may
 drive their status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To state whether a risk-seeking consumer spends more or less on non-durable
 consumption we need to understand what goals of the consumer are in an
 intertemporal setting (where status consumption may appear to be less beneficia
l than saving for assets).
 This is developed in the later sections.
 It is worth pointing out at this stage however that in an economy with
 more than three consumers (as in the above example), the risk-profiles
 (such as those of an academic, sportsperson and the investor) are also
 influenced by the peer effects that induce non-durable consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assist an empirical view of the above outline of a model, we define a
 long-term asset as a durable goods that may benefit the consumer regardless
 of her risk-appetite.
 A risk-seeking individual would get more utility from the non-durable consumpti
on than the risk-averse individidual even though a long-term durable good
 is equally desirable by both (this is possible because long-term durable
 goods are of infinite life).

 the relation between loss-aversion and possessions.
 If the long-term assets can be considered as part of the wealth that can
 be passed on to generations, the short-term concerns of the consumer (which
 are influenced by the acquired wealth) comprise only of needs and quality.
 In other words, if there is any status related utility to be derived from
 non-durable consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from quality
 (which is defined as distance from needs).
 This is because a consumer with a habit of high-quality in consumption
 (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfilment of consumer needs itself carries no such influence on status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we associate non-durable consumptioin with subjective probability, the
 status-related consumption (primarily non-durable consumption) is exhibited
 as a risk-seeking behaviour i.e.
 when the 
\shape italic
subjective 
\shape default
probability is much higher than the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability.
 Those who are hoping to enhance their social network or get ahead of others
 through signaling (or peer effects) are likely to believe in a higher likelihoo
d of their promotion to a higher status (a higher probability corresponding
 to a state promotion - resulting in a higher utility for the same observed
 probability for a consumer with higher belief).
 The perceived probability of loss of one's status may similarly be higher
 (e.g.
 that of threat of immigration to one's personal wealth) than the

observed
\shape default
 probability in the long-term.

\begin_layout Standard
It is worthwhile to dwell upon the micro-economic processes that represent
 the interplay of the two levels of uncertainties.
 We could view these uncertainties as an expression of delay or barriers
 in the flow of information related to risks in the consumer markets.
 When it comes to risks to the future wealth, the firms and institutions
 are often both better equipped and more responsive than the individuals
 or small communities.
 The barrier to information - are key in understanding the limits to the
 free-market assumption which considers an autonomous consumer fully capable
 of addressing her true needs.
 The differences in purchasing power between sections of a society and their
 desire for mobility might as well drive the consumption and the economy
 (see Smith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmithMoralSentiments"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 as well as a recent discussion in Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) but the implicit assumption in the free market view of an exchange between
 the rich and poor sections driving economic progress is that the consumer
 has full information of the risks and incentives related to her income
 (or the economy functions in a way that these risks are known to the consumer).
 The barriers to the flow of information - which a consideration of two
 uncertainties attempts to model - could partly explain why this exchange
 may be less feasible in more recent times (see Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Such barriers or delays subject to the fundamental changes in an economy
 such as rapid industrialisation, advertising effects, centralisation of
 markets or their expansion.
 As long as it can be admitted that the information about socio-economic
 changes is consumed at different speeds and extent amongst the consumers
 than firms then it must follow that the information of risks is not considered
 fully by the consumer.
 Thus the consumption in the short-term is likely to be influenced by asymmetrie
s in the observation of risk.
 On the other hand, it is also true that the beliefs of the consumers do
 not matter in the long run - since the resources in the world are influenced
 by the actions taken on beliefs rather than beliefs themselves.
 This is why observing the long-term durable consumption (which is the mark
 of long-term status) is required to reconcilie the consumers' subjective
 probability functions.
 In the long-term the consumer beliefs reflect in the changes in long-term
 assets - likely by letting the the risk-averse behaviours balance the risk-seek
ing behaviour in the population of consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formulation of subjective probability allows us provide a more descriptive
 model of consumption under uncertainty.
 Consider a world where the perceived probability and observed probability
 were the same.
 
\bar under
Here, a lower material status (i.e.
 lower wealth, lower education etc.) would encourage the consumer to save
 for high-cost assets or invest in characteristics that enhance her success
 and rather than indicating status through high quality in certain categories
 (e.g.
 luxury items
\bar default
) that are meant to accompany high-status.
 If status is simply the long-term view of wealth, then leaving others behind
 in non-durable consumption is futile.
 When subjective probability is not the same as the observed probability,
 the consumers would not view the true observed probability of their mobility
 and their wants (which they estimate through a perceived probability )
 may not achieve their long-term needs.
 The status consumption must exist whenever the perceived probability is
 different from the observed probability and need not exist when the perceived
 probability is the same the observed probability.

Comparing subjective probability based approach with the permanent income

 could detail this claim a little further.
 The fundamental claim of the PIH is that income has a transitory and a
 permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional to the
 permanent component
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancellation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 Friedman's assumption of the independence (zero-correlation) between the
 transitory component and the permanent component - is a condition stronger
 than what one may require if the non-durable consumption was viewed in
 the intertemporal substitution frameork.
 Instead of the zero-correlation assumption, we model the uncertainty explicitly
 in the utility.
 While PIH observes the dispersion in income amongst socio-economic classes
 (gauged with a simple variance in past income), we are also interested
 in the dispersion in quality and wealth owing to social hierarchy.
 Thus unlike PIH, we also do not explicitly ignore the role of

But even with relative income concerns
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 (which can be incorporated in PIH), status-related consumption is an aberration
 if the consumer is meant to always achieve the goal of improving her wealth
 by minimising the volatility of income streams.
 If conspicuous consumption were truly futile, then there would be no way
 for the rational consumer to derive any utility from status-related consumption
 either.
 The explicit subjective uncertainty we attach to to the advantage that
 one receives from status consumption - allow the representative consumer
 to benefit from status consumption and deviate from her long-term plans.
 Unlike in PIH, the uncertainties associated with the short-term preferences
 and the long-term preferences are not independent of each other - as the
 latter is  interpreted as weight of the probabilty based on the degree
 of risk-aversion.
\end_layout

The deviation from long-term plans subject to constraints is a paradigm
 often used in the implementations of life-cycle methods.
 A particularly relevant approach is provided by Thaler et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who argue that there should be no overeating and overspending if the consumers
 were rational.
 In the context of status consumption which we are concerned with, the mere
 existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there is some utility
 to be derived by spending what is not rationally advantageous to the consumer
 in the long-term.
 The models of

 one's utility (see Ireland model

 Focusing on quality and assets rather than visibility, our approach does
 not diminish the role of

Reconciliation
\series default
 What reconciles the subjective probability with the observed probability
 in our model is the process of how long-term assets evolve ower time (alternati
vely, one could observe income as the process driven by long-term characteristic
s and consumption driven by the subjective functions).
 The items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 are considered long-term assets while those that cannot be passed are considere
d short-term.
 The observed probability is contributed to by the assets transferred between
 generations in the long-run as there is little more than the net asset
 worth of the individual - whose probability is determined by factors more
 tangible than perception i.e.
 factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.
 - that are passed over as inheritance.
 On the other hand, the subjective probability of success through social
 interactions and the high quality consumption associated with it need not
 matter in the long-term - since the path to net asset worth may completely
 ignore the non-durable consumption habits of the past.
 Unlike with a permanent income approach the two uncertainties are thus
 not expected to be independent of each other but are reconciled by transfer
 and ownership of long-term assets in the economy.

: Our view of

status consumption as
\bar default
 non-durable consumption could appear in conflict with how conspicuous consumpti
on the public discourse where it is often presented as a phenomenon that
 only-serves-the-rich.
 Even though we view a conspicuous item as one that can be used both to
 distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself, there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst
 the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 If we admit a definition of status consumption as a means to distinguish
 oneself from one's own reference group and agree that everyone belongs
 to a particular reference group, then we must conclude that everyone can
 benefit from status consumption (i.e.
 a direct albeit probabilistic improvement of the consumer's perceived status
 can be achieved with status consumption).
 Further, if the long-term consumption is defined as assets that stay the
 same over many generations (so that all else is considered non-durable)
 then a focus on non-durable sufficiently captures the sense of conspicuous
 consumption as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason to object to the view of status consumption as a consumption
 exclusive to the rich is that the utility to the rich from status consumption
 might be quite little given the fact that the rich consumer already has
 enough to distance herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have
 anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave
 anyone behind).
 It can be argued instead that even the poorest may want to indicate that
 they are not the poorest - much the way richest may want it to be known
 to the others that they are indeed the richest

 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 is needed for everybody - as everyone in the middle (those who are neither

Public/Private, Reconciliation:
\series default
 In summary, our approach is similar to the visible consumption approach
 in the sense that we do view the net utility from status consumption as
 a combination of a private utility (subjective) and a public utility (observed
 through rise in wealth) but we consider a case where status consumption
 is seen the risk associated with the future states of risk - a formulation
 that allows us to use the insights from prospect theory.
 The perception of future based on purchased items has been a topic of more
 interest to the marketing literature than to the literature in developing
 economics that has explored status consumption lately.
 We incorporate some of the insights from the former by considering the
 utility from status consumption as a probabilistic private utility.
 We argue that such a utility is not futile in a material sense - a luxury
 watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared to its cheaper
 alternatives with same functionality i.e.
 of telling the current time), but if an aspiring businessman uses his knowledge
 of luxury watches to find new clients for her business, then the futile
 consumption can translate into a material advantage.
 The promise of social mobility is indeed the core appeal of status consumption.
 Items like luxury watches are important only because the rich flock around
 them.
 Thus if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, if one considers conspicuous consumption futile it can only
 be in a material sense that does not consider the consumer's perception
 of risk.
 We argue that the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may offer
 is important as it acts as a means of connecting the rich with the not-so
 rich.
 A belief in social mobility is key to status consumption which offers an
 advantage to the representative consumer that is driven by a small chance
 of success - a probability which the consumer is likely to overestimate
 or underestimate ( gauged with a probability weighting function).
 In the example of luxury watches, we know that only a few of the purchasers
 of luxury watches would improve their self-image and enhance their social
 networks - others would remain mere purchasers.
 This is why the subjective probabilities are reconciled with an observed
 wealth process.
 We develope the model based on these ideas in the next section.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inter-temporal model relies on income savings, an interest rate of growth
 and depreciation.
 If consumption could be split into certain and uncertain parts, then we
 could associate the two with the observed and subjective utilities.
 More particularly, one could argue that the growth of the consumer's income
 process is independent of the subjective uncertainty (higher probability
 to landing in a state of higher status than what is known through more
 deterministic trends of income) which influences the non-durable consumption.
 An important part of such a model would be the depreciation (or discount
 factor) associated with the final wealth.
 The literature often uses discounting based on education and social classes
 (demographic variables provide the discount factor in the utility function
 see Cagetti
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CagettiWealth2003"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 While one could associate the discount factor with the occupational or
 educational classes with the relevant data, we set ourselves to see how
 depreciation may different in terms of risk and household characteristics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we consider a basic model with two consumers compete for more assets
 and relative consumption qualities, then the introduction of an interest
 rate and a depreciation factor (dependent on individual characters) brings
 a lot of assumptions about choice that we wish to understand.
 Instead of assuming a depreciation of assets and a discounting curve, we
 focus on how the consumers' evaluation of future risks would affect their
 choice.
 Therefore, in a simplified model we assume no credit (the consumers don't
 loan to each other) and no direct depreciation or growth of assets and
 income is observed indirectly as part of evolution of asset value (or wealth).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The depreciation of assets in the model is only through direct expenditure
 - which in turns consists only of consumption or investment.
 Needs don't offer status advantage in the model - but all non-durable consumpti
on above needs does.
 The consumer also realises that everything above needs is only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slightly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 probabilistically) futile so she doesn't choose to spend all her income
 (asset value) on non-durable consumption.
 We contrast two appraoches for the model - one is the conventional appraoch
 where the growth of wealth is deterministic and the other is one where
 the evolution of wealth is a stochastic process which is evaluated by the
 consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we details in the Section , the two models therefore differ in how consumer's
 effort or investments relates to the payoff in every period.
 The first (non-stochastic case) considers a certain payoff for effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and thus a deterministic path to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 while the stochastic case considers a risky payoff (and an uncertain path
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $A)$
\end_inset

 for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 For the purposes of status consumption, we believe that the latter (stochastic)
 approach offers an instance that is closer to the real world.
 It is in evaluating a future path to higher-wealth (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) where the status competition is unleashed.
 In this later (stochastic) case, the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 also determines the risk the consumer takes towads the future state of
 wealth.
 A more risk-seeking individual is meant to spend more on non-durable consumptio
n.
 This makes sense only because we're seeking utility is relative to the
 other consumers.
 In such a relative concern, the needs of the consumer (which are common
 by definition) have no role to play.
 In real-world, consumption is driven by needs and they expand.
 We are less concerned with how family size and life-cycle effects - as
 we observe two consumers competing for status while there needs are fulfilled.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the stochastic case, when the payoff in every period is risky, we don't
 consider the consumption as part of the competition - as it already fact
 mirrors the perception of risk with the future asset (this is because any
 consumption that is not non-durable adds towards wealth in the model).
 As explained in Section, the claim in the stochastic case that the consumption
 above needs represents consumers risk is the equivalent of the claim in
 the non-stochastic that a consumer competes with others with consumption.
 We also compare how the two models would be have under the considration
 that extreme wealth differences are not sustainable in a society and necessitat
e an income redistribution (taxation)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This redistribution also reassures that the consumer basic needs are always
 met in the model - and thus only non-durable consumption above need is
 relevant to status competititon.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 With the latter models, we attempt to answer whether risk-averse consumers
 would settle for less status consumption depsite higher wealth possession
 or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Non-Stochastic Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the non-stochastic case, let's say we have consumers 1 and 2 who compete
 with each other for the assets they possess.
 A degenerate case would be one where ever 
\bar under
consumer has a certain wealth level and no 
\bar default
option but to bear a cost/depreciation on her wealth accunt e.g.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\Delta A}{A}=-\psi$
\end_inset

.
 If utility is only achieved from wealth, then she would have no incentive
 to raise this rate of decline with more consumption so as to prolong the
 lifetime of the wealth she possesses.
 If we have two consumers who both observe each other's wealth then too,
 the consumer has no incentive to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 from its minimum possible value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degenerate case therefore of no practical use as there is nothing that
 the two consumers can compete over.
 To provide an some incentive to the poorer consumer (lower wealth account
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ), we can introduce an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 from consumer's effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

.
 Now the consumer gets to change the destiny of her wealth as she get an
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\xi$
\end_inset

 for effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and hopes to bridge gap between wealth accounts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As wealth doesn't necessarily decline or grow, we can introduce a cost function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 associated a wealth account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 so that the consumer with higher wealth bears a higher absolute cost.
 Consider now the dynamics of the two consumers in this no-uncertainty model
 with income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{t})$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
A_{t+1,1}=A_{t,1}-\delta(A_{t,1}+\pi\xi_{1})+\pi\xi_{1}\nonumber \\
A_{t+1,2}=A_{t,2}-\delta(A_{t,2}+\pi\xi_{2})+\pi\xi_{2}\label{eq:dynamics_expenditure}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without loss of generality, let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 As long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi>1$
\end_inset

, the consumer 1 would increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1,t+1}/A_{2,t+1}$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer 2 would similarly maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2,t+1}/A_{1,t+1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the game is to end at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, then the consumer 2 must always choose a 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not occur before time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, if the consumers only cared about relative wealth then
 there is no reason for the consumer 2 to allow 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}$
\end_inset

 before 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the consumer 1 would like to achieve 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 soon as possible instead of having to wait until 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The only stable condition in the above game is when either
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 or when 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}\ge0$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is maintained as desired by consumer 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a practical standpoint, this too doesn't change the model significantly
 from the degenerate case since the wealthy consumer has no incentive to
 reducing her wealth except when the cost-function offers a steep upward
 rise to the richer consumer.
 Another possibility is to consider that the consumers don't actually optimise
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively but the combinations 
\begin_inset Formula $(\xi_{1},A_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\xi_{2},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 instead.
 After all we judge those around us in the real world not just by their
 wealth but by what they do with their wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two fundamental ways to include the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

) in the view of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 First is to let an explicit combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,A$
\end_inset

 in a loglinear or a similar form (so that there is some substitution between
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 both in within period and across periods i.e.
 the intertemporal substitution).
 The second way is to view either just 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

( or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) adjusted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 respectively).
 It could be for example argued that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is all that is visible and is competed with - so that there is a fair game
 to play between consumer 1 and 2.
 The wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may still matter but only in the providing the upper bound for 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 (poorer consumer cannot afford too much 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

).
 Indeed when the differences in wealth are high, a fair game based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 may not be plausible (the poor consumer's 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is not going to be of much value).
 In such a case, we cannot ignore the role that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 plays.
 This is why we seek a game considering 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which

Notice that the consideration of relative wealth must always carry a sense
 of reference point in the above equation.
 Indeed the poor and rich may have completely different reference points
 and hence the claim that they both optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}/A_{2}$
\end_inset

 would require qualification.
 We assume that the reference point is between 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$

and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 and choose a geometric mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A_{1}A_{2}}$

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and

A fundamental limitation of the above model is that the difference in wealth
 accounts can grow wider without any recourse.
 For the two consumers to continue with the game it makes sense to allow
 an income redistribution so that whenever a proportion of the total wealth
 difference is given to the poor consumer.
 In a simple extension of the the model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 above, we introduce a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 on relative wealth which is transferred to the poorer consumer.
 The dynamics in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

It can be verified that the amount

\end_inset

 transferred to the poorer consumer reduces to 0 when both the consumers
 achieve the same wealth (i.e.

 This is particularly interesting when utility is derived both from 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

 With such a redistribution in place, if

Stochastic Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have argued before the assumptions of wealth depreciating or rising
 at a constant rate are too limiting for our purposes of understanding the
 competition between consumers under uncertainty of future wealth.
 To represent a scenario closer to the real-world, we consider an uncertainty
 both in the consumer's perception of and her pursuit for wealth.
 A wealthy individual does not silently earn interest on income - but in
 fact must compete with others who are acquiring new wealth by investing
 into newer areas.
 As she competes with others and guards her wealth, she has no choice but
 to bet on uncertain pursuits.
 Indeed we make no attempts to model the processes of creative destruction
 that create new goods and services affecting wealth of some vs that of
 others.
 We thus assume that those with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

old
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth have full information of the new wealth opportunities (full information
 market) and therefore new wealth is replaced with old wealth in the model
 through risky investments.
 The only competition that exists in this model economy is between the risk-seek
ing individuals and risk-averse individuals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Role of Uncertainty: 
\series default
The stochastic case attempts to understand the consumer's intertemporal
 choice as a simple lottery scheme.
 As the consumer's investments (i.e.
 consumption which is indistinguishable from needs) are hoped to increase
 the asset in some way, the expectation of growth in one's assets is embedded
 in the expenditure one makes.
 Anything that is not expended contributes to the save wealth for the consumer.
 Over generations the assets can either decline significantly or grow in
 value due to the strategy adopted by the consumer.
 Further, since staying in an elite non-durable consumption club offers
 only a probabilistic benefit i.e.
 a club membership might eventually get the consumer in the rich club over
 generations (with a low probability).
 The consumer's choice could be represented as one amognst many lotteries-
 ranging from the option keep secure cash savings, to a balanced strategy
 of spending towards education in the hope for income rise over year or
 to a bet on an expensive 
\bar under
club membership in hope for relevant social connections
\bar default
.
 The consumer's own risk-profile would determine the selection of a particular
 lottery.
 In other words, the same observed probability may be considered too risky
 or not risky enough for consumers with different degrees of risk-aversion.

 Not having assumed a depreciation or an interest-based growth with the
 wealth account allows us to attribute the growth or depreciation in the
 wealth account to consumer's perceived uncertainty with a risky future
 growth in wealth.
 To accentuate the uncertainty in the growth of wealth, consider a gold
 rush economy where more digging increases the chances of getting a higher
 wealth.
 This is equivalent to finding new wealth in an economy - where luck favours
 the prepared.
 There is no inherent depreciation in the wealth - except through consumption.
 Thus even a lot of wealth could quickly deplete with a high rate of consumption.
 With no new investments (search for gold) the others might find more wealth
 leading to relative poverty in this goldrush economy.
 We consider consumption and investment (search expense) as one variable

 If a consumer is allowed to have an irrational expectation of closing the
 wealth gap, then the previous utility model can only indicate that a consumer

 wealth if their consumption

 Given the limited supported for expected-value maximisation in behavioural

 It follows with the function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{t+1})$
\end_inset

 that a a risk neutral consumer making a one-time decision on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 A risk-seeking consumer would choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{CE}$

\end_inset

 would be considered risk-averse.
 If we use a CRRA utilty to illustrate this fruther.
 As

\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))$

 The measure of risk-aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 If every consumer optimises

 There is something peculiar about the simple dynamics of equation - it
 is that the definition of assets has made the perceived uncertainty control
 only through consumption (or investments

 This is meant to represent a particular situation of uncertainty in assets
 growth where i) assets decline only through consumption (risk) and ii)
 the consumption (risk taken) is fully under control of the consumer.
 We could thus arrive at a solution to the equation if we assume diminishing
 returns for risky gain

There is an desirable property of the model that is also handled with PT.
 As we have noted earlier, not every consumer would respond to the same

observed

probability of growth in assets in similar manner.
 To model the attitude towards risk, we consider a weighting of probability
 to differentiate the risk-seeking behaviour from the risk-averse behaviour.
 Also since we let the consumption and investments

 need to worry about the combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 The combined utility of

The PT approach also allows us understand the cost-function

 from the non-stochastic approach as an investment towards the higher probabilit

 In other words, if success were a lottery, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 would be the cost to be paid to take part in the lottery.
 This cost rise steeply as the rich gets richer.
 In the stochastic model, the cost of participation is part of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 which is paid to improve the likelihood of change in wealth.
 So the individual receives the higher likelihood of wealth change only
 after an upfront asset bearing cost

 is paid.
 Thus the structure of

Much the same way with the non-stochastic case, there would be a case for
 income redistribution if through a stroke of luck, the consumer 1 becomes
 much richer than consumer 2 (event 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Unlike in the non-stochastic case, however, the two consumers would choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 based not only on the basis of the actual uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 but also their own degree of risk-aversion (

 In other words, the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 depends on both the degree of risk-aversion and relative wealth (distance
 from reference wealth).
 While we have assumed a Bernoulli distributio for 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

, a real-world scenario may depend on how the properties (unobserved) like
 creativity, talent or luck are distributed in the population (in the goldrush
 example, that would simply be the distribution of gold).
 Assuming that such a distribution is known we may have a situation when
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<<A_{2}$

 and the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 might decide to exchange her different services where she takes very little
 risk and just gets an income

 from the consumer.
 The income to redistributed can still be seen as a proportion

This time the equilibria would involve the stochastic term as well.
 The risk-taking is therefore shared.
 This helps us refine how redistribution policies such as taxation might
 allow the (separating?) equilibrium for risk-seeking and risk-averse individual
s to exist.
 This is relevant for status consumption because the risk-sharing - across
 groups segmented by social strata, occupation or class - would imply that
 status consumption is not necessarily important when the class differences
 are strong.
 This is the refinement that we started with the intention to find.
 Indeed an income-sharing arrangement does influence status consumption
 as well.

Separating the income process from the perception of wealth also helps us
 understand the differences in consumer demand for status consumption in
 two populations that are distant in terms of a macroeconomic variable or
 a supply characteristic (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy).
 More particularly, if we may set 
\shape italic

\shape default
 inputs to the uncertainty in income growth (i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability), we could separate the effects of supply issues from the demand
 for status in the respective economies.
 When comparing a developed economy with a developing economy, for example,
 the strength of welfare institutions is of a particular significance.
 In the developed economy, on one hand, the state institutions intervene
 when market forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertaki
ngs or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distributio
n of public goods.
 When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 The uncertainty in observed probability can capture this difference as
 we compare developed economy with a developing economy and help separate
 the consumer demand from the disparate economic conditions

To illustrate why the uncertainty of an income process may be important
 for measures of status consumption, consider the status imparted through
 education - whose quality may vary in a particular economy.
 As a consequence of the difference in expectation of growth, education
 may carry more status-value in the developing world than it would in the
 developed world - simply because the distribution of education (and other
 similar assets that may be public goods) is state-assisted in a developed
 country and the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny is
 lowered.
 Thus, the extent to which education may eventually matter towards status
 in the developed economy depends on how consumers set themselves apart
 in the social order based on other means of signaling status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), a consumer would
 associate higher risk with the expected growth in education (which can
 be modeled with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability in the income process).
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support in a developing country.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions thus determines the expectation of accumulation
 of public goods (such as family education level) as how much education
 may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect of the strength of
 institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets that may provide
 the expanded consumption choices to the consumer.
 The two uncertainties in the model allow us to perform such comparisons
 by parametrising the disparate conditions as the

If one chooses to ignore the modeling of a parameter for strength of welfare
 institutions altogether (due to the belief that the demand for conspicuous
 consumption eventually benefits the society as a whole as the money is
 reinvested for the benefit of the poor in exchange for their services),
 it would still be instructive to parametrise the efficacy of institutions
 that would collect the money obtained from the rich on conspicuous items
 and fund employment and other opportunities.
