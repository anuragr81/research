\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is derived based on the framework for intertempor
al consumption choice in the presence of long-term assets.
 Status is endogenised as states of financial stability and included as
 part of the consumer's utility in the intertemporal model for substitution
 between quality in non-durable consumption and savings for future assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
If consumers optimised status with both non-durable consumption, If the
 end goal of the consumer was to maximise her wealth where non-durable consumpti
on was both and expense and a risky jump in social ranking.
 Consider education - where less expenditure guaranteed to disadvantage.
 Education is both an expense and investment.
 If we observe only such expenses i.e.
 those which affect savings but also increase the wealth by a certain probabilit
y.
 This increase is only a proxy of increase in status which would increase
 the income in a more realistic model.
 In this simple model, there is no income and therefore investments increase
 with a certain probability as if wealth too increased.
 Since the rich have something to lose in this game the know that by not
 taking too much risk i.e.
 by lowering 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, they would lose out on the risk.
 As the rich are loss-averse, they would also like to keep their rich position.
 These are endognised in a model.
 Status consumption - in the general sense that Veblen had talked about
 - includes educations and should be viewed as this risky investment.
 The model of risk-sharing is obviously more general and applies to industrial
 organisation and politics as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The studies on conspicuous consumption tend to explore a specific instance
 of status consumption.
 Here, conspicuous consumption is expected to occur through a certain type
 of (visible) goods that are meant to be futile for the general needs of
 the consumer.
 This assumption allows us to use to the separability of demand for visible
 goods.
 Before we can assume that much of status consumption occurs through visible
 commodities (clothing, shoes, jewelry etc.) in the developing economies,
 we revisit the framework of demand with a consideration of risk associated
 with the promotion through social rank advancement so as to view status
 consumption in a more general context.
 While such a model might does not benefit from the tractability that the
 models for visible consumption benefit from, the inclusion of the estimates
 of wealth of the consumer (e.g.
 asset ownership in consumer data), if available, may provide some necessary
 insights into status consumption by observe how quality across commodities
 is consumed with respect to the wealth of the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[A general sense of status consumption - we argue - must come from a combination
 of higher quality across commodities and a stable ownership of wealth or
 assets].
 We use an intertemporal consumer choice framework and a utility for long-term
 incentives and near-term demand for quality to develop a general model
 for varied cultural contexts.
 In what could be seen as an attempt to refine the permanent income approach
 (which vigorously ignores all non-monetary wealth), we model the consumption
 on quality as sensitive to the perception of how (subjectively) probable
 a future state of financial security is to a consumer.
 The assets (durable items) owned are viewed as an indicator of wealth and
 the high quality commodities as the consumer's attempt to improve their
 perceived status.
 Arguing that consumption is myopic and depends on the perception of status
 in a near-term while savings are cumulative in an intertemporal model for
 consumer choice, we let the representative consumer in the model optimise
 utility inclusive of status.
 As the signalling utility a consumer receives from consumption must come
 from either high-priced non-durable consumption or long-term durable consumptio
n, the signaling is viewed as the utility obtained from consumption of quality
 and owned assets over time.
 Taking an approach different from the PIH, therefore we thus consider how
 types of non-monetary wealth may matter towards the perception of risk
 (monetary or non-monetary) and attempt to relate the substitution between
 saving for assets and consumption of quality in the life-time of the consumer
 to the long-term growth in the consumer's material wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a framework helps us answer if the consumers in one economy may engage
 in status consumption more than they do in another.
 To compare status consumption in two different economies, we first consider
 differences in the items accessible to the consumers (i.e.
 the consumer basket) and the relative income structure (the two are referred
 to as the supply issues in the model we describe).
 Then we stardise the supply issues - availability, prices differences and
 clustering - so that the demand for status consumption can be conditioned
 on a certain level of supply.
 The fundamental issues with such a standardisation of supply are resolved
 with a notion of standard needs and the quantification of the effect of
 wealth or severe income differences on the consumer choice.
 The measure of quality (inclusive of any status consumption) in this manner
 - which is as accurate as the measurement of the cost of needs - would
 be influenced by the wealth of the consumer and possibiliy the characteristics
 such as social identity or regional idenitity in economies with low social
 mobility or social segregation,.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of wealth on quality is detailed with consideration of risks
 perceived by the consumer.
 The costlier long-term assets may discourage savings for the future (the
 consumer may give up hopes of acquiring assets if she is to remain in a
 low income group relative to asset costs) and the perceptions of high mobility
 may encourage the consumer to overspend on quality in the short-term (matching
 one's consumption to one's perceived status).
 As the assets have a more definite impact on the consumer's secure long-term
 growth (assets being a stronger indicator the stability of her income),
 in equilibrium, the consumer would balance the more uncertain perception
 of her status with the more certain expected value of savings in her lifetime.
 If the consumer income is assumed to follow a process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer spending on her needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is known, then observing the proportion of consumer's spending on quality
 (which also determines the savings rate for durable goods in the intertemporal
 settings due to the total income constraint) with respect to the measures
 of wealth can help us comment on the contexts of status consumption in
 the two economies.
 This we believe is key to understanding status consumption across economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption and income are associated with two different uncertainties
 in this model for status consumption.
 The probability associated with the first uncertainty is due to the subjective
 view of the consumer of her own future states of wealth while the second
 uncertainty is that of macroeconomic variables where the consumer's (private)
 subjective interpretation matters very little.
 The probability functions corresponding to the consumer's perceptions that
 match their expenditures on quality (i.e.
 the first uncertainty) are fundamentally guesses and may be subject to
 conditions local to the consumer rather than the longer-term economic variables.
 The subjective probabilities of the consumer however also need to be coherent
 with the economy's long-term growth which is associated with the second
 uncertainty in the model.
 We closely follow the ideas of subjective probability (due to de Finetti
 and Savage) in developing the theoretical basis of the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, we view status-related consumption in a conventional model for
 consumer demand with a consideration of perceived risks.
 We justify an interpretation of status consumption from quality and assets
 based on the assertion that for a rational consumer to spend on status
 consumption, she must see some status utility from consumption in the long-term
 or the short-term.
 As the goal of separating oneself from others through consumption (when
 all else fails) is effectively to minimise one's own perceived risk (if
 not the actual risk) of departure from the high-income group, status consumptio
n is likely to exist for every consumer in an economy where social stratificatio
n exists - thus generalising our model for status consumption across all
 consumers.
 Based on this model for status, we argue that the consumer's focus on consumpti
on may be more pronounced in societies undergoing economic upheavals (e.g.
 introduction to global markets, industrialisation), where the poorer social
 identities may try to cross previously imposed barriers through consumption
 (through a bandwagon effect) while those with richer social identities
 attempt to guard their status through consumption (a snob effect).
 This general model could be used to understand status consumption in the
 developing economies where the presence of status consumption is more likely
 to influenced by severe economic inequalities.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

The advancements in game theory and statistics from the last century - particula
rly the theory of decision under risk - can explain some of the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour that Veblen had observed in the late
 19th century.
 The effect that social conditions have on human behaviour remains an area
 of active research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"

.
 However, the theory of decision under risk (see von Neumann-Morgenstern
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VonNeumannMorgenstern1944"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) has successfully explained many of the apparent paradoxes in human behaviour
 (see Dhami 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 It is possible - within the remit of this theory - to view status consumption
 i.e.
 the disproportionate spending on goods that only have a status (or visible)
 appeal as an instance of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour.
 We inherit from the literature on habit formation and visible consumption
 while adopting this approach to status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature from behavioural economics, marketing research and development
 economics all seem to concur on the tendencies of habit formation in consumer
 behaviour.
 The measurement of changes in habits and quality has a long tradition in
 neoclassical economics (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment of the problem).
 Of particular interest is the model for myopia amongst consumers described
 by Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who had noted the significance of lagged consumption on aggregate consumption.
 The life-cycle model used by Muellbauer has been of considerable importance
 in more recent studies on consumption where a rational utility-optimising
 consumer balances between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned savings over her life-time i.e.
 in an intertemporal substitution setting (a problem often treated equivalent
 to the classical utility maximising consumption problem).
 Improving upon the classical approach where the consumer is subservient
 to her optimised plan for life-time savings and consumption, a few behavioural
 approaches (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for example) have sought descriptive models for mental accounting and factors
 such as willpower to better understand the development of habits in consumers.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice, the
 representative consumer in such models is subject to overeating, overspending,
 accumulating items she doesn't need or acquiring habits she cannot afford.

 Elsewhere too, rapid industrialisation has created a disproportionate change

With an assumption that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the
 regular sense - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for
 visible consumption may be considered separable (additively) from the utility
 for non-visible consumption (we refer to this assumption as the futility
 assumption henceworth) .
 Much of the literature in the so-called visible consumption follows this
 .

 We favour a more general approach linked with the intertemporal substitution
 - where snob and bandwagon behaviour form the fundamental mechanisms for
 status consumption.
 The latter approach allows us to include wealth differences and the quality
 in an intertemporal setting - where the competing behaviours of snob and
 bandwagon items are subject to the uncertainty perceived by the consumer

The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor

We consider this uncertainty-based notion of status as a type of wealth
 that has an influence on whether the consumer chooses to consume in the
 short-term or invest for long-term purchases.
 Considering the consumer's long-term security from extreme income fluctuations
 as a notion of status we attach an uncertainty with this long-security
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This idea of status - as the consumer's long-term stability of income -
 is also aligned with how status is measured in the literature from health
 and sociological sciences - which often track status with a vector of income,
 education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.

 for a few examples).

.
 However, delineating a probability function for the consumer's view of
 security of her long-term income is hardly non-trivial.
 Status, after all is a social psychological concern and is observed at
 the level of the individual (or that of a social unit or a reference group).
 Thus while a researcher observing a population of consumers may measure
 the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk associated with the transition
 to the highest band of net-worth in the long-term, the consumer may have
 an a subjective view of her status not necessarily in agreement with the
 researcher.
 The two perspectives may not need to disagree, but the consumer's view
 of status could consider the socio-political conditions which she perceives
 from within a particular social unit (family, community, ethnicity or region)
 more important than the uncertainties in income which a researcher observing
 long-term.
 In other words, a short-term view of status (which the consumer perceives)
 could disagree from the long-term view (which a researcher would observes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the long-term, a high-status individual is someone who has either or
 both of high income and a high (inter-generational) probability to move
 towards the high income group (stability).
 Let's call this the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of wealth transition (i.e.
 a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{ij}\}$
\end_inset

 representing the transition from wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) - which the researcher observes.
 A low-status individual - similarly - is someone who has either or both
 of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 The researcher - concerned with the long-term effect of such factors to
 the asset ownership and stability of income - may assume that all consumers
 observe the same probability of transition to higher state of income but
 the consumer would be motivated by the particular short-term concerns with
 respect to the social unit that influence her view of status and self-image.
 Thus the uncertainty of wealth transition is observed at multiple levels
 in this subjective formulation of probability.
 The probability of material wealth transition that a consumer associates
 with the future is fundamentally subjective - although determined largely
 by factors related to social or regional identity.
 For the purposes of this discussion, we consider this latter sense as 
\shape italic
perceived
\shape default
 probability of wealth transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How the perceived probabilities may relate to the observed probability is
 effectively the subject that de Finetti had first discussed in his influential
 paper.
 This forms the basis of much of Bayesian analyses used in .
 Our goal in this paper is to allow the consumer to transform the observed
 probability.
 Fundamentally, the consumer's 
\shape italic
perceived
\shape default
 probability is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as her
 occupation, education, social or familial background, personality types
 etc.
 and is subject to change over the her lifetime.
 Since consumption is usually myopic, such a view would influence consumption
 at all times.
 The notion of status, self-reference and peer effects all influence the
 risk-seeking behaviour of the consumer which are captured in the consumer's
 subjective probability function

\end_inset

.
 The risk-averse behaviour is expected when the prospect is valued lower
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $E(L)$
\end_inset

.
 It is well known that the consumers don't behave according to the expected
 (concave) utility.
 To separate the effect of uncertainty on decision making from the effect
 of payoffs in a non-concave utility function, one often views the utility
 as a product of the consumer's utility for payoffs 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(x)$
\end_inset

 and probability weighting function 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 so that they act according to 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(L))=\sum w(p_{i})\upsilon(x_{i})$

 Setting

\end_inset

 leads one back to the expected utility case.

\end_inset

 i.e.
 the

 probability.
 On the other hand, the growth in the income and wealth of the consumer,
 unlike the subjective probability which drives consumption in the near
 term, are constrained with long-term economic conditions and can be assumed
 to be associated with a different probability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the difference between the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probabilities is rather moot in the long-term.
 Still, the non-durable consumption of the consumers would be associated
 with this view in the short-term.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider three consumers with different
 occupations in a microeconomy - an academic, a sportsperson and an investor
 - who all share the share the same reference point (by assumption) for
 wealth.
 They all estimate the probability of doubling their wealth in the lifetime
 so that they may retire on the successful achievement of their goal.
 Given the nature of the profession, it is likely that the sportsperson
 overestimates the probability of her success until the middle of her career
 - after which the probability she associates to the success of doubling
 her wealth (if she hasn't already) would decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A risk-seeking behaviour would be associated with a sportsperson much the
 way a risk-averse behaviour is associated with the academic who may be
 well aware of the limited probabilty of a windfall in the short-term.
 On the other hand, an investor may be after a definite gain over a fixed
 term and have a risk-profile that lies somewhere in between that of the
 sportperson and the academic.
 While the long-term decisions of the sportsperson may still be determined
 by the knowledge of expected income, a sportsperson would be characteristised
 by the belief in an unlikely probability of success in the near-term in
 a way that is different from how an academic or an investor would foresee
 her wealth transition.
 If we can assume that the three consumers have the same basic needs, it
 is extremely unlikely that the consumption of the three individuals would
 be independent of how they view the transition probability of their monetary
 wealth in the near term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To state whether a risk-seeking consumer spends more or less on non-durable
 consumption we need to understand what goals of the consumer are in an
 intertemporal setting (where status consumption may appear to be less beneficia
l than saving for assets).
 This is developed in the later sections.
 It is worth pointing out at this stage however that in an economy with
 more consumers than those in the above example, the identities (such as
 those of an academic, sportsperson and the investor) include the peer effects
 that induce non-durable consumption.
 Our definition of long-term assets is of durable goods that benefit the
 consumer the same regardless of her risk-appetite.
 The utility derived from non-durable consumption on the other hand - depends
 on the risk-profile of the consumer.
 A risk-seeking individual gets more utility from the non-durable consumption
 than the risk-averse individidual even though a long-term durable good
 is equally desirable by both (this is possible because long-term durable
 goods are of infinite life).

If the long-term assets can be considered as part of the wealth that can
 be passed on to generations, the short-term concerns of the consumer (which
 are influenced by the acquired wealth) comprise only of needs and quality.
 In other words, if there is any status related utility to be derived from
 non-durable consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from quality
 (which is defined as distance from needs).
 This is because a consumer with a habit of high-quality in consumption
 (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment of needs) would

have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfilment of consumer needs itself carries no such influence on status.

d of their promotion of higher status (a higher probability corresponding
 to a state promotion - resulting in a higher utility for the same observed
 probability for a consumer with higher belief).
 The perceived probability of loss of one's status may similarly be higher
 (e.g.
 that of threat of immigration to one's personal wealth) than the

We wish to bring an attention to the economic processes representing the
 interplay of the two uncertainties.
 One view to that expains these uncertainties is the idea of delay or barriers
 in the flow of information related to risks in the consumer markets.
 When it comes to risks to future wealth, the firms and institutions are
 both better equipped and more responsive than the individuals or small
 communities.
 The barrier to information - are essential in understanding the limits
 of the free-market assumption which considers an autonomous consumer fully
 capable of addressing her true needs.
 The differences in purchasing power between sections of a society and their
 desire for mobility are said to drive consumption and economy (see Smith

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) but the implicit assumption in this free market view of the exchange between
 the rich and poor sections driving economic progress is that the consumer
 has full information of the risks and incentives related to her income
 (or the economy functions in a way that these risks are known to the consumer).
 The barriers to the flow of information - which a consideration of two
 uncertainties attempts to model - could partly explain why this exchange
 may be less feasible in more recent times (see Hirsch

Such barriers or delays subject to the fundamental changes in an economy
 such as rapid industrialisation, advertising effects, centralisation of
 markets or their expansion.
 As long as it can be admitted that the information about socio-economic
 changes is consumed at different speeds and extent amongst the consumers
 than firms then it must follow that the information of risks is not considered
 fully by the consumer.
 The belief of the consumers don't matte rin the long run - because the
 resouecs in the world are limited by real terms rather than the beliefs.
 We long-term durable consumption (which is the mark of long-term status)
 as this very process of reconciliation.
 In the long-run the risk-averse may be balanced by risk-seeking individuals
 and one could still consider the average consumer over the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a world where the perceived probability and observed probability were
 the same, a lower material status (i.e.
 lower wealth, lower education etc.) would encourage the consumer to save
 for high-cost assets or invest in characteristics that enhance her success
 and rather than indicating status through high quality in certain categories
 (e.g.
 luxury items) that are meant to accompany high-status.
 When this is not the case, the consumers would not view the true observed
 probability of their mobility and their wants (which they estimate through
 a perceived probability ) may not achieve their long-term needs.
 The status consumption must exists whenever the perceived probability is
 different from the observed probability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the very long run, it may not matter it would not matter whether the

At this point it is worth comparing our approach with the permanent income
 hypothesis
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The fundamental claim of the PIH is that income has a transitory and a
 permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional to the
 permanent component
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancellation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 Friedman's assumption of the independence (zero-correlation) between the
 transitory component and the permanent component - is a condition stronger
 than what one may require if the non-durable consumption was viewed in
 the intertemporal substitution frameork.
 Instead of this strong condition, we model the uncertainty explicitly in
 the utility.
 While PIH observes the dispersion in income amongst socio-economic classes
 (gauged with a simple variance in past income), we are also interested
 in the dispersion in quality and wealth owing to social hierarchy.
 Unlike PIH, therefore, we do not explicitly ignore the role of

 just the monetary value of assets may be adequate - the argument goes.

 The relative quality of non-durable consumption in the short-term and in
 the presence of non-monetary wealth (as well as the consumer's evaluation
 of the risks associated with wealth) thus carries the notion of conspicuous

\end_inset

 (which can be incorporated in PIH), status-related consumption is an aberration
 if the consumer is meant to always achieve the goal of improving her wealth
 by minimising the volatility of income streams.
 It could be argued more generally that a rational consumer predicting future
 incomes based on the past incomes would have no reason to engage in any
 status related consumption at all (neither in short-term nor in long-term).
 If conspicuous consumption were truly futile, then there would be no way
 for the rational consumer to derive any utility from status-related consumption
 either.
 Include status consumption in the consumer's demand for quality and assets,
 we assign an explicit advantage to how consumers may set themselves apart
 from others to achieve higher utility in the short-term and acquire assets
 in the long-term (as the consumption of quality is of no significance in
 the long-term).
 Therefore the explicit subjective uncertainty we attach to to the advantage
 that one receives from status consumption - allow the representative consumer
 to benefit from status consumption and deviate from her long-term plans.
 Unlike in PIH, the uncertainties associated with the short-term preferences
 and the long-term preferences are not independent of each other.
 Even though no consumer may truly know the probability of change in states
 of wealth, the consumer can estimate this probability around a long-term
 process

Defined as a subjective perception of the stable high net-worth - is constituted
 in the consumer's long-term utility.
 If not, the model's representative consumer would have no reason to engage
 in status-related consumption in any form.
 That the consumer may deviate from her long-term plans introduces an explicit
 uncertainty in the model - since a consumer has limited knowledge of the
 future states of her wealth.
 At the same time, the growth of her income process - is independent of
 the subjective probability (of a higher probability to landing in a state
 of higher status than what is known through more deterministic trends of
 income) that inflence the non-durable consumption - which is essentially
 a short-run compared to .

As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable status-co
nsumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a consumer can
 a achieve higher perceived-status in the model not only by the acquisition
 of assets (which is assisted with higher income) but also by the less definite
 increase of chances of status promotion through consumption (which may
 enhanced social interactions and improve self-image).
 The consumer's subjective probability which drives such consumption is
 not necessarily an inaccurate view of the physical probability of the inter-gen
erational social mobility but a perception of risk which she may share with
 others in her reference group.
 In the long-term, the wealth (status or assets) the consumer acquires would
 eventually be aligned with the income process while her short-term view
 would have addressed the demand for quality through non-durable consumption.
 The role of non-durable consumption is therefore two-fold in the model
 - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer and second, it
 also matches the consumer's (subjective) perception of her own trajectory
 of status promotion through high-quality consumption (

 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity in

 priced in the market

 We also argue that assets themselves would bring some quality constraints
 - thus segregating ways in which quality is consumed between those own
 assets and those who don't.

 the

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 What we have introduced is the separation of consumer's uncertainty about
 the process of wealth transformation (an uncertainty that results in deviation
 from needs as high quality consumption) from the uncertainty in the income
 process - while tracking the two with different variables.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"

\end_inset

, the purpose of considering two levels of uncertainty is to allow the represent
ative consumer to deviate from her long-term plans (which are themselves
 assumed to be exogenous in the model and contribute to the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 uncertainty).
 The two uncertainties in the model are a consequence of i) status bringing
 some utility to the consumer and ii) possible deviation from the consumer's
 long-term plans influenced by perceptions of wealth transition probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Other than the fulfilment of needs, there are two goals that short-term
 consumption performs in the near-term simultaneously - it gets a relative
 advantage compared to others and increases the consumer's chance of asset
 promotion in the future with a small probability.
 These the consumer may forgo completely to hope for asset promotion in
 the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth clarifying that treating quality in non-durable status-related
 consumption as a deviation from long-term plans and needs is not the same
 as viewing conspicuous consumption as the consumer's error in judgment.
 By tracking consumer's deviation from her needs and equating consumption
 of quality with 
\shape italic
perceived
\shape default
 probability, we do not make any descriptive claims about the consumer's
 belief.
 Since consumption is myopic while savings are cumulative, the association
 of a felicity from quality with the perceived probability of status promotion
 is for us only a way to differentiate the more certain probabilities of
 the income process from those that contribute to the deviation from fulfillment
 of basic needs in the short-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also worth emphasising that conspicuous consumption should not appear
 trivialised when viewed as mere higher-quality consumption.
 We find that a lot of appeal for conspicuous consumption in the public
 discourse is formed due to it being presented as a phenomenon that only-serves-
the-rich.
 Even though a conspicuous item is seen as an item that is used both to
 distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself, there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst
 the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 A view that considers conspicuous consumption a way to distinguish oneself
 from one's own reference group and the reference wealth level through consumpti
on would need to admit a more general definition of status consumption that
 considers the effect of the distance from fulfilment of basic needs on
 the the consumer's signaling.
 If we can agree that the signaling behaviour can be exhibited by everyone
 and cause a direct (albeit probabilistic) improvement of the consumer's
 perceived status, then an increase in her consumption corresponding to
 her perceived status is justified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason to object to the view of status consumption as a consumption
 exclusive to the rich is that the utility to the rich from status consumption
 might be quite little given the fact that the rich consumer already has
 enough to distance herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have
 anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave
 anyone behind).
 We argue instead that even the poorest may want to indicate that they are
 not the poorest - much the way richest may want it to be known to the others
 that they are indeed the richest
\begin_inset Foot

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 is needed for everybody - as everyone in the middle (those who are neither
 the richest nor the poorest) must also try to avoid getting poorer and
 try to become the richest at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(See unclassified chatper's rewrite:) As we have argued before, the claim
 that perceived status is matched with consumption implies that there is
 a probabilistic private utility to be derived from conspicuous consumption.
 A luxury watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared to
 its cheaper alternatives with same functionality), but if an aspiring businessm
an uses his knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business,
 then the futile consumption can translate into a material advantage.
 The perception of status - however unrealistic - can influence one's wealth
 if everyone in one's reference group also acts in accordance to the perception.
 It may be apt to consider conspicuous consumption futile but only in a
 sense that is different from what a modeler would be concerned with.
 Items like luxury watches are important only because the rich flock around
 them.
 Thus if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
 However, the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may offer is
 important as it acts as a means of connecting the rich with the not-so
 rich.
 A belief in social mobility is therefore key to status consumption - which
 as part of high-quality consumption - offers an advantage to the representative
 consumer that is driven by a small chance of success - a probability which
 the consumer is likely to overestimate or underestimate.
 In the example of luxury watches, we know that only a few of the purchasers
 of luxury watches would improve their self-image and enhance their social
 networks - others would remain mere purchasers.
 As explained before, we are not concerned with how many of the businessmen
 actually believe that conspicuous consumption would help them (i.e.
 we do not attempt to describe their beliefs) - as we are only interested
 in how many buyers of luxury watches actually achieve success over the
 long term.
 Their purchase of luxury watches would indicate their perceived probability
 of success while the rises in their incomes would indicate the observed
 probability where the characteristics other than luxury watch ownership
 may dominate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the operationalisation of the model, the long-term assets as well as
 the exogenous income process are what would reconcile the two uncertainties.
 The items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 are considered long-term assets while those that cannot be passed are considere
d short-term.
 The observed probability is contributed to by the assets transferred between
 generations in the long-run as there is little more than the net asset
 worth of the individual - whose probability is determined by factors more
 tangible than perception i.e.
 factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.
 - that are passed over as inheritance.
 The subjective probability of success through social interactions and the
 high quality consumption associated with it need not matter in the long-term
 as the path to net asset worth may completely ignore the non-durable consumptio
n habits of the past.
 Unlike with a permanent income approach the two uncertainties are thus
 not expected to be independent of each other but are reconciled by transfer
 and ownership of long-term assets in the economy - a process that the Euler
 equations in the intertemporal substitution are meant to capture.

\begin_layout Standard
Having associated quality with less certain perception of social connections
 and ownership of long-term assets with more certain parameters of growth
 income, we now turn to how a consumer may achieve both in the context of
 needs and prices.
 Our view of non-durable status-related consumption is essentially that
 of non-necessary consumption - and thus empirically, it must rely on a
 sound definition of needs - which provide the reference point for quality
 in the model.
 That there must be the idea of universal needs is itself a contentious
 issue.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs can supersede
 her subjective interests (wants).
 We lean towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need
 of the consumer without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts should be standardised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Health and autonomy may be fairly abstract ideas when the context of consumption
 is not limited to food and employment.
 When considering quality in food, for example, this seems a relatively
 easy task as we may just consider the cost of the cheapest option for proteins,
 carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area.
 For contexts other than food, however, what constitutes basic needs is
 less trivial.
 For example, what constitutes a basic house or a basic set of furniture
 would require some justification based on a cultural or geographic context.
 Standardising needs in terms of the quantity of non-durable consumption
 poses another issue - since the non-durable consumption may depend on the
 long-term assets that the consumer possesses.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and thus a high non-durable consumption
 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical assets would not have
 the respective non-durable consumption).
 To get around the issue, one may therefore consider needs at the asset
 level rather than at the level of non-durable consumption.
 In other words, to answer the question whether electricity is a need or
 not one must answer whether possession of the electrical equipment is a
 need or not.
 One the level of basic needs in a population of consumers is established,
 the cost of needs of the consumer are driven the local price of the needs
 and a certain personal characteristics (e.g.
 residence in an expensive region).
 It may make sense therefore to attach a quality constraint to the level
 of asset ownership the consumer achieves or to the long-term characteristic
 she possesses.
 This is in more detail in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:ObservedVariables"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that status is not considered a need using this
 approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the asset
 level she achieves while the her basic needs are independent of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption - whether for the researcher
 or the consumer - is derived by both assets and quality (across all commodities
) - driven by wealth and income of the consumer (rather than high-class
 or low-class needs of the consumer).
 As an example, the difference between the status of a rich and that of
 a poor family in our model is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 the family combined with a demand for quality for education (with a higher
 price for higher quality).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference point of needs is crucial to our view of quality as it is
 simply a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 If the quality of consumption calculated in such a manner is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\rho,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of assets owned 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 education, occupation) of the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 By the definition of needs, the consumer cannot compromise on needs to
 address quality or asset accumulation - therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is omitted from the utility function.
 Since consumption changes with the perceptions of wealth, the dependence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\rho$
\end_inset

 can give more structure to the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon$
\end_inset

.
 For example, while a consumer may want to improve quality instead of saving
 for an asset, the quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may not be improved beyond a certain point until more assets are purchased.
 For example, in the household category, high prices of housing may encourage
 the consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus improve 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) but she may improve the quality instead of buying a bigger house only
 until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 Here, the consumption of quality moves together with assets that the consumer
 acquires.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<<EXPAND THE THEORY on how 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dependence also has implications on the additivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(A,\rho,\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The limited substitution between assets and non-durable consumption allows
 us to express the utility function as 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon=f(A)+g(\rho)+m(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 As the consumer matches her consumption with the perceived wealth and certain
 high quality non-durable consumption is available only when associated
 with a corresponding asset or a long-term characteristic (such as education,
 housing, identity, region owing to segregation, trade barriers etc.), higher
 quality choices would accompany higher-quality assets.
 The substitution between low-quality asset and high-quality non-durable
 consumption being limited due to co-movement of expensive non-durable consumpti
on with expensive asset ownership also means that the quality differences
 in the assets can be ignored.
 A high-quality asset is thus merely a more expensive asset in the utility

The personal characteristics can be seen as an ordinal rank.
 Some researchers have considered it the classes, but we find a continuous
 variable more tractable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the needs, quality and personal characteristics quantified.
 price derivatives may enter the utility and consumer decision.
 Without price changes, the consumption of quality would change only when
 individuals acquire long-term durable goods or give up hopes of acquiring
 costlier assets (possibly due to other needs).
 As the consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality, a rise in
 quality must come either from an increase in income or from an undercut
 in savings.
 Similarly, if needs stay the same, a drop in quality must be due to purchase
 of assets or a drop in income.
 Faced with change in prices, a consumer may prefer quality in one commodity
 over another (i.e.
 a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport to food or
 vice versa) as she addresses her needs and long-term assets requirements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate this with an example, consider a middle-income family that
 moves to a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants
 are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place.
 One way to view this change in the consumer's circumstances is to observe
 that the price of entertainment services are lower for the consumer in
 the new neighborhoods.
 Assuming the needs of the family (indicated by the number of family members)
 haven't changed, the consumption would either shift to saving for a better
 car or improve quality in some other category (better jewelry, better schooling
 for kids etc.) in response to price changes or a equivalent changes in income.
 The sensitivity of consumption with respect to price thus comprises of
 sensitivity with respect to basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\eta_{t}}$

Stochastic Evolution of Model Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the properties of the utility function discussed so far, we now discuss
 the evolution of the three observed variables in the model.
 These are the needs of the consumer, the income of the consumer and the
 assets owned.
 We also observe the consumption within certain categories (which for in
 the current chapter are food, energy, transport and household) that are
 then related with observed variables with the quality control that the
 consumer exercises.
 These variables are assimilated in the Euler equations corresponding to
 the intertemporal substitution setting.

Needs of the consumer

As we have hinted in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:UtilityOutline"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, our notion of quality is dependent on what we consider as needs rather
 than the characteristics of items (see Rosen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenImplicitHedonic1974"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a summary of hedonic approaches).
 We define needs as the standard requirements not meeting which would lead
 to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory argued for by Doyal
 and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, the counter-argument
 would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the consumer incurred
 by not having other nutrients is definite - thus ruling out a starch diet
 fulfilling the set of dietary needs.
 However, such a theory of needs is a normative concern (rather than descriptive
) - as a consumer may not always want her needs.
 Such a model for needs cannot represent a situation where consumers forgo
 a certain need to compromise on their health or autonomy in favour of some
 other wants.
 This makes the task to ensure that the needs are indeed just a minimum
 necessary set for health and autonomy to the individual extremely important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost of the basic requirements per head 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends on the scale of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the cost of the needs per head.
 Every household may get more utility as she increases her needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 but it is safe to assume that a consumer has a negligible uncertainty associate
d with how her needs would evolve in her lifetime (this assumption is not
 required in a non-stochastic setting).
 Thus she already knows the future path of her needs at all times.
 Whether we model the needs of the household as a unit that lives forever
 (dynasty) or as a household individual with a finite lifetime 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, the evolution of needs as the number of living family members at a certain
 period must be aligned with the population trends in the economy.
 In the particular context of a developing country, we may find that the
 expected path of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t,T)$
\end_inset

 is influenced with a high population growth rate and prevalence of a joint-fami
ly structure.
 Based on the data observed in the sub-Saharan African countries, we consider
 the functional form 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t,T)=\mathbbm{1}_{t<T}\mu te^{-\kappa t^{2}}$
\end_inset

 to map the age 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of the income process in the model is to separate the factors
 affecting economic growth from the factors that influence the consumption
 of quality.
 The separation of this income process is critical to the notion of status-relat
ed consumption (considered as part of the distance from needs) - which we
 argue is driven not only by the expectations of income but also with the
 longer-term beliefs of success related to class, educational level, occupation
 (the wealth transition matrix).
 In other words, the different types of wealth that the consumer may have
 would influence the savings for assets - other than the income or its volatilit
y
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We attach no uncertainty to the growth of income in the non-stochastic model.
 Thus the growth rate would remain the same forever and is known to the
 consumer.
 In the stochastic model, on the other hand, one could let the consumer
 maintain two uncertainties - the first being in how her annual income unfolds
 in her future years and the second before how she becomes part of a stable
 high-consumption club through means other than income growth.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus while the exogenous income process may depend on education or occupation
 levels, the effect that long-term characteristics have on consumption are
 not necessarily through income but through constraints or the stability
 that the long-term characteristics and expectations may bring.
 As the effects of on consumption are modeled explicitly, it would suffice
 if the income process models an expectation of the monetary growth i.e.
 a reflection of the steady growth in the economy on to the consumer's budget.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Separating the income process from the perception of wealth also helps us
 understand the differences in consumer demand for status consumption in
 two populations that are distant in terms of a macroeconomic variable or
 a supply characteristic (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy).
 More particularly, if we may set 
\shape italic
a priori
\shape default
 inputs to the uncertainty in income growth (i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability), we could separate the effects of supply issues from the demand
 for status in the respective economies.
 When comparing a developed economy with a developing economy, for example,
 the strength of welfare institutions is of a particular significance.
 In the developed economy, on one hand, the state institutions intervene
 when market forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertaki
ngs or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distributio
n of public goods.
 When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 The uncertainty in observed probability can capture this difference as
 we compare developed economy with a developing economy and help separate
 the consumer demand from the disparate economic conditions

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate why the uncertainty of an income process may be important
 for measures of status consumption, consider the status imparted through
 education - whose quality may vary in a particular economy.
 As a consequence of the difference in expectation of growth, education
 may carry more status-value in the developing world than it would in the
 developed world - simply because the distribution of education (and other
 similar assets that may be public goods) is state-assisted in a developed
 country and the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny is
 lowered.
 Thus, the extent to which education may eventually matter towards status
 in the developed economy depends on how consumers set themselves apart
 in the social order based on other means of signaling status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), a consumer would
 associate higher risk with the expected growth in education (which can
 be modeled with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability in the income process).
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support in a developing country.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions thus determines the expectation of accumulation
 of public goods (such as family education level) as how much education
 may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect of the strength of
 institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets that may provide
 the expanded consumption choices to the consumer.
 The two uncertainties in the model allow us to perform such comparisons
 by parametrising the disparate conditions as the

If one chooses to ignore the modeling of a parameter for strength of welfare
 institutions altogether (due to the belief that the demand for conspicuous
 consumption eventually benefits the society as a whole as the money is
 reinvested for the benefit of the poor in exchange for their services),
 it would still be instructive to parametrise the efficacy of institutions
 that would collect the money obtained from the rich on conspicuous items
 and fund employment and other opportunities.

 More specifically, if we consider a dynamic process for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\rho,A,\nu)$

 riskier in the developing economy (than in the developed economy) thus
 requiring a higher expenditure on the quality associated by the consumer
 in the developing economy.

Change in asset ownership over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wealth of a consumer is represented with a combination of accumulated
 assets and long-term characteristics (education, occupation or social identity).
 Here, asset ownership is modeled with an asset account - whose value is
 reflected in the total cost of assets inclusive of cash assets that the
 consumer owns.
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase assets and the actual purchase
 of assets.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all assets in
 the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success to preferences
 being the same for everybody) that provides furniture, housing and all
 amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every asset and service - offered as a life-long subscription - can be
 purchased by giving an amount to this company.
 We also assume that at the of the lifetime of a consumer, her personal
 wealth would either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so
 that the asset account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth
 of someone else in the economy.
 Consequently, while all individuals in the population are assumed to be
 the same as our representative consumer in terms of the preferences for
 needs over quality, they differ in the the starting amount of their asset
 accounts as well as the trends of their salaries, the trajectory of their
 needs and their long-term quality habits.
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and a steady growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, she would after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working her salary is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the total income she has earned is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{\tau}i_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 At a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased assets from a portion of her income and decided
 that she does not want more assets for the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, her life circumstances might have changed (she may need
 a bigger house or want a more expensive house) thus needing more assets
 urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs

For simplicity, we can assume an environment of zero interest and one where
 no depreciation is associated with the assets (which are easy to introduce
 if considered necessary) is assumed.
 Also, due to the minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing

 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only asset available in the market.

 that would relate 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t},i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$

 By definition of the needs, a consumer is meant to select a quality control
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 only after her needs

 in the near-term analysis).
 The quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 (in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) is simply the distance in money terms from the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}(\eta_{t})$

ASSETS CONSTRAINING QUALITY

\begin_layout Standard
Incurring of non-durable costs imposed by the assets one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.) means either that avoiding the respective expenses is
 not an option for the consumer owning some assets or that some certain
 long-term choices or characteristics (e.g.
 not having a house or living in a region that doesn't have electricity
 available) would limit the choice to avail quality through non-durable
 consumption.
 Thus assets have a direct influence on the cost as well.
 For example, a homeowner is required to maintain her own house the way
 someone who doesn't own the house has to pay the rent.
 As some costs are incurred due to the assets that the consumer acquires,
 a distance from the basic needs (which are themselves imposed only by health
 and autonomy requirements) could be introduced as the consumer acquires
 more assets.
 Such

\end_inset

).
 Let's consider the needs (without the adjustment for assets) as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 is stochastic and depends on the history of 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not change as it is independent of choices the consumer makes), it
 takes into account both the observed probability - which governs 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$

 and the subjective probability that governs 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}.$

 Here, we refine 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$

 The peer effects of

 If success were a lottery,

In a simple two-period model with a simplification where there are no needs

This is also the point where a weighting function should be introduced.
 How individuals underestimate or overestimate risks is best explained with

 Generally, the consumer behaviour is stated as

 (
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$

 is the payoff-utility function for the consumer.
 However, our model considers that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is not known by the consumer - she is supposed to maintain some conditional
 probability and act based on her own conditioning.
 Since we have to have a conditional probability that is invariant with
 underlying uncertainties in income, let's assume a transition probability
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}=p(A_{i}\rightarrow A_{j},A_{i})$

 There is no concept of need other than assets in this context.

 Opening taps has a cost - but the more important question is - how do taps
 determine income is the quantitative detail missing.
 In this sense education is too is a sink that .

First question is whether opening taps causes holes (meaning does taking

 Holes can be caused if there is too much gold (

 This make the effect one-way i.e.
 holes bring income with some risk but they income doesn't cause holes per

 If a rich were to give up her wealth, she would dig a sink but just not
 bigger than what she needs for her basic needs to be fulfilled.

If we can say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 increases the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, then the second question is how exactly does cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 of opening a tap depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 They clearly cannot just be a simple ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, otherwise the rich would bear more of this cost and the poor very little.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 must be a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

, this would mean the poor cannot compete with the rich.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 is something that consumers can allocate to from 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Rich can lose if they don't take risks and they don't share their wealth
 through opening more holes - their access to must therefore be lower.

Notice that we took gold only to stress that too much of it does not have
 any value.
 If we take fruits of nature - then we know that their appeal .
 But our behaviour for long-term durable goods is more akin to that towards
 gold rather than fruits of nature.
 The latter would also be driven by their demand - but accumulation of gold
 reflects cash assets - and the lumpsum evaluation of our riches and that
 of others we're constantly doing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we consider a continuous process where 
\begin_inset Formula $d\Psi$
\end_inset

 is controlled by the consumer (all else is exogenous), we must must a process
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

.
 Are consumer's investments exponential, linear, mean-reverting? Should
 we assume a shape of choices or of the income process instead? It's worth
 looking into the relationship of 
\begin_inset Formula $d\Psi$
\end_inset

 with others.
 Assuming that the process 
\begin_inset Formula $d\Psi$
\end_inset

 exists, if the income changes depend on how much non-durable consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 an individual does and growth of assets are influenced by i) income change
 ii) the depreciation and iii) 
\begin_inset Formula $d\Psi$
\end_inset

, the relationship would be :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

di=\mu(\Psi)dt+\sigma(\Psi)dW\nonumber \\
dA=di-\delta(A)-d\Psi\label{eq:di_evolution}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming a depreciation is also key since that is what motivates investment.
 We know that depreciation is higher for the wealthy.
 The income seems to be different for the poor than for the rich.
 The rich cannot just get a job - and they have to rely more on digging
 holes to maintain their wealth.
 Nobody would give them a job that would double their wealth - the poor
 can easily find that job.
 So the income is a process that diminishes after a while 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 grows slowly at higher values - or that 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 is larger for those with smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 than for those with large 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of the model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:di_evolution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and it is lower for the rich only because relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 would be very little (as it's driven only by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

).
 We need to see if 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 should depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or not.
 If rich-poor-level-field is important, then 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 shouldn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (the rich lose in a way that poor don't) but since rich are supposed to
 lose only by loss of wealth - it can be understood with higher deprecation
 rate for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The next question is how do needs reduce depreciation.
 The rich should be able to scale up 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 - but there asset would also decrease proportionately with 
\begin_inset Formula $d\Psi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another idea is to consider needs as the rate of loss of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=\frac{dA}{dt}$
\end_inset

.
 Yet another idea is to keep 
\begin_inset Formula $di=\mu(\Psi,A)dt+\sigma(\Psi,A)dW$
\end_inset

 and keep depreciation at a constant rate for everybody.
 The choice requires some discussion.

All Needs as Investment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's view all needs as some an investment or good-bearing costs.
 The poor cannot invest but they can get a job where income is stable -
 rich can't get a job and they have to take a risk with investment.
 Otherwise the those - this is the first numerical test that can be done.

Consider the process 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(i_{t+1})-ln(i_{t})=\frac{1}{i_{t}^{\alpha}}$

 In the continuous form - this could be a function of form 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}=1-e^{-\alpha t}$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $di=\alpha e^{-\alpha t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that income does not increase with investment whereas goods can.
 The growth of investments keeps one's goods account stables.
 A wealthy person must increase investments to maintain the wealth - if
 new businesses rise where new risk are being undertaken, then those with
 old wealth must take more risk.
 We would assume that those with old wealth have full information of the
 new wealth opportunities (full information market) and therefore therefore
 new wealth doesn't replace the old wealth in the model.
 The only way creative destruction is allowed in the model is by new jobs
 being created and goods account itself affecting income of others.
 This too is ignored for the moment - the only competition is between the
 risk-loving wealthy individuals and risk-averse poorer individuals.
 If we standardise the risk, we might find that the poor are more risk-seeking.
 This depends on how individuals assign weight to the probability (the weighting
 function).

\begin_layout Subsection
Utility from Relative Wealth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider a degenerate case where the consumer has a certain wealth
 level 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 and no option but to bear a cost/depreciation of having the assets that
 comprise of her wealth i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\Delta A}{A}=-\psi$
\end_inset

.
 If utility is only achieved from wealth, then she would have no incentive
 to raise spend this rate of depreciation as to prolong the lifetime of
 the wealth she possesses.
 If we have two consumers who both observe each other's wealth then too,
 the consumer has no incentive to increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 from the its minimum possible value is always the dominant strategy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degenerate case is not of any practical use - also because there is
 nothing that levels the relative wealth of the two consumers.
 A form that may provide some incentive to the poorer consumer is one where
 an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is available to both the rich and poor consumer.
 Therefore, the consumer gets to change the destiny of her wealth as a new
 opportunity of increasing wealth comes along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering a case under no uncertainty where a new opportunity in the form
 of an investment that returns net income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\psi$
\end_inset

 for an investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 comes along, the consumer would be encouraged to spend more of her wealth
 and hope to bridge gap between wealth.
 Notice that the consumer does not choose between saving for assets and
 expending in this case - she merely wishes to compete for the total assets
 (hence no budget equation).
 In other words, the consumer would take a loan and have more assets only
 that she would have to bear the cost of credit (which in an ideal world
 are the same as taxes on the wealth).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reflecting that the consumer with higher wealth would bear higher depreciation
 in absolute terms having more, we can separate the depreciation from the
 income by considering a cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 and and income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 for the effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (which is no longer the depreciation).
 Consider the dynamics of the two consumer in this no-uncertainty model
 with income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
A_{t+1,1}=A_{t,1}-\delta(A_{t,1}+\pi\psi_{1})+\pi\psi_{1}\nonumber \\
A_{t+1,2}=A_{t,2}-\delta(A_{t,2}+\pi\psi_{2})+\pi\psi_{2}\label{eq:dynamics_expenditure}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without loss of generality, let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 As long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi>1$
\end_inset

, the consumer 1 would increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1,t+1}/A_{2,t+1}$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer 2 would similarly maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2,t+1}/A_{1,t+1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the game is to end at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, then the consumer 2 must always choose a 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not occur before time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, if the consumers only cared about relative wealth then
 there is no reason for the consumer 2 to allow 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}$
\end_inset

 before 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the consumer 1 would like to achieve 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 soon as possible instead of having to wait until 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The only stable condition in the above game is when either
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

 or when 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}\ge0$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is maintained as desired by consumer 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a practical standpoint, this too doesn't change the model significantly
 from the degenerate case until we consider that consumers don't actually
 optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively but the combinations 
\begin_inset Formula $(\psi_{1},A_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\psi_{2},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 instead and if there is some substitution between acquiring assets and
 spending income on futile investments.
 If we introduce the substitution with a cost function which represents
 the costs of maintaining wealthier assets apart from the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, the resulting model may represent the real-world slightly better.
 After all we judge those around us in the real world not just by their
 wealth but by what they do with their wealth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two fundamental ways to include the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

) in the view of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 First is to let an explicit combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,A$
\end_inset

 in a loglinear or a similar form (so that there is some substitution between
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 both in within period and across periods i.e.
 the intertemporal substitution).
 Some part of wealth - which is in transit (as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

) is of a separate value for wealth comparisons.
 The second is to view either just 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

( or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) adjusted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 respectively).
 In this latter form, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is all that is visible - so that there is a fair game between consumer
 1 and 2.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 matters but only in the providing the upper bound for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (poorer consumer cannot afford too much 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 This second option may make little sense when the differences in wealth
 are acute and a fair game based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is hardly plausible (the poor consumer's 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is not going to be of much value in the fair game).
 In such a case, we cannot ignore the role that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 plays.
 A model considering only 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 does not model any sense of mobility until we introduce uncertainty in
 the perception of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet another way to introduce some dynamism in the setting is by introducing
 a mechanism of redistribution of wealth.
 Introducing, an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 and investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 as well as a redistribution process may sound unnecessary but this could
 represent the real world schemes of redistribution e.g.
 taxation where the wealthy consumer pays a higher absolute amount - only
 because extreme differences in wealth are to be avoided in order for both
 the players to participate.
 In a simple extension of the the model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dynamics_expenditure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 above, we may a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 on relative wealth which is transferred to the poorer consumer.
 The dynamics in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dynamics_expenditure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 can be rewritten as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
A_{t+1,1}=A_{1}-\delta(A_{t,1}+\pi\psi_{1}+\tau(A_{2}-A_{1}))+\pi\psi_{1}+\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})\label{eq:dynamic_nonstoch_w_redist}\\
A_{t+1,2}=A_{2}-\delta(A_{t,2}+\pi\psi_{2}-\tau(A_{2}-A_{1}))+\pi\psi_{2}-\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})\nonumber 
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 transferred to the poorer consumer reduces to 0 when both the consumers
 achieve the same wealth (i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 This is particularly interesting when utility is derived both from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - as it gives the dynamics the characteristics of a zero sum game.
 With such a redistribution in place, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $>A_{1}$
\end_inset

then the consumer might want to keep 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}/A_{1}$
\end_inset

 low only to get some utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 (rather than giving the amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 to consumer 1 (a quantitative description needed).
 An appropriate form of 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A,\psi)$
\end_inset

 would give us the conditions for an equilibrium.

The consideration of relative wealth must always carry a sense of reference
 point in the above equation.
 Since the poor and rich may have completely different reference points
 and hence the claim that they both optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}/A_{2}$
\end_inset

 would require qualification.
 We consider the case when the reference point is simply a mid-point between
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We choose a geometric mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A_{1}A_{2}}$
\end_inset

 as the dynamic reference point for the loglinear utility comprising of
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 The utility to be maximised for the consumer 1 and 2 are 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{1}{A_{2}}\sqrt{\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}},\psi_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{1}{A_{1}}\sqrt{\frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}}},\psi_{2})$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 One could also argue that only the wealth-in-transit is visible for comparison
 purposes, the relative wealth would only involve 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1},\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$

 remain the same for all the periods until 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, we only need to look at the minimisation of the first-period.
 To arrive at a solution we can assume a form of the cost-function.
 Since the cost of assets are disproportionately higher for the ultra rich
 as function such as 
\begin_inset Formula $aA_{t}^{b}$
\end_inset

 would make sense.
 When the costs of being rich are sudden as is the case in very unequal
 societies, a more appropriate function would be.
 This choice seems rather aribrary - and the structure of cost-function
 depends on a lot of factors not immediately related to the budget constraint
 (i.e.
 purchase cost of assets).

In the real-world, indeed the investments of the form

 may separate the consumer's perception of risk from the uncertainty she
 perceives about her wealth.
 To this end, we explain a discrete model before providing an outline for
 the continuous model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer utility under risk is different from the utility derived without
 risk (see Shoemaker).
 If a consumer is allowed to have an irrational expectation of closing the
 wealth gap, then the previous utility model can only indicate that a consumer
 with lower wealth would get the same overall utility as consumer with higher
 wealth if their consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is sligthly dissimilar.
 This does not allow us the risk-seeking consumer from a risk-averse consumer
 by the shape of the utility function.
 As in the case without uncertainty, we contract an approaches where a consumer
 optimises only the wealth with one where both 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are considered.
 This is performed in the case of a discrete model before the approach for
 a continuous model is extended.

At this point, it is worth discussing the forms of utility the consumer
 would optimise under risk.
 In the asset pricing models, one often looks at the forms of value-based

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 The combined utility of

The uncertainty model also provides a more microeconomic meaning to the

 If consumers only observe 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

The question now is whether the income arrangement would solve the issue.
 First off why do we need it.
 First let's consider what would happened if

 On average two consumer encounter different uncertainty - they would choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 based not on the actual uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$

 but there risk-aversion.
 If they're risk averse their asset would fall.
 We consider utility function of the relative wealth - it's not enough that
 the consumer has enough income - it would be bad if the consumer loses
 out to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use a probability weighting function, we can use 
\begin_inset Formula $P(A_{T}=A|\psi)=Binom(\frac{A+\psi T}{\ensuremath{\sigma(\psi)}}$

\begin_inset Formula $Binom$
\end_inset

 is the point-probability of the binomial distribution of size

 An appropriate form of 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 the prelec function or any of the functions listed above) can give us a
 condition where utility optimisation is more nuanced (see Rabin

 The consideration of risk allows us to consider how risk-seeking and risk-avers

\begin_layout Standard
To explore the risk-sharing, consider no utility function (the consumers

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

, the consumer may be encouraged to take a risk so that eventually 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}$

 in income 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 corresponding to wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 is lower as 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 rises.
 There is a mandatory depreciation with wealth - which is not like the cash
 assets which grow at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

  She could increase the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $d\psi$
\end_inset

 to balance the expected growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 Given the income change 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

 the consumer effectively needs to balance the gain in utility between i)
 gained 
\begin_inset Formula $dA$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $di-d\psi$
\end_inset

 and ii) a probabilistic expected change 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)dW$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 is an increasing function of the investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 Anything that is considered a need by the consumer is also an investment
 in this way (assuming that basic needs are met for everyone and that no-one
 is living with no income less than the cost of basic needs).
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 would represent the risk-perception of the consumer.

Here, the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\rho,t)$
\end_inset

 and the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 both would determine the risk that a consumer takes.
 More risk would be needed if economy grows and depreciation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is high.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is also positively correlated with the rise in incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\rho,t)$
\end_inset

.
 In a growing economy both depreciation and rise in incomes would be rapid.
 It may be possible to combine the two parameters with the rate of economic
 growth.
 The conventional asset-growth model ignores that the income for poor is
 determined the wealth of the not so poor.
 This must be reflected in the income process - by letting the income growth
 not growing higher than a certain wealth - which would respond to the higher
 wealth.
 Responding to external trade may be seen as a similar behaviour on an aggregate
d economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aggregation is another important view - if we can aggregate the incomes
 and wealth of a 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{k}$
\end_inset

 consumers in a village, then 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{k}$
\end_inset

 their income and asset process could be expressed in a similar form.
 The form of 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 need to satisfy this aggregation property - and should be used to understand
 the risk management profile of a village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the two are correlated, we can see that the asset growth 
\begin_inset Formula $dA$
\end_inset

 in continuous time depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 If the final goal is to accumulate wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, then the the rich consumer would lose out if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 increases and she doesn't increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 She must increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 to prevent a decline in 
\begin_inset Formula $dA$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise in a stagnant economy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 would be low (i.e.
 it won't rise with time and its expected value in current time would be
 low).
 The risk must be taken by the lower asset consumer for her to hope to rise
 her 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The game can only be won by accumulating more wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important distinction is made about the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 We don't consider the usual assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 grows with a constant rate.
 We believe that wealth - as a cash asset or inheritable wealth has the
 property of decline in value more fundamentally.
 A pot of gold (probably a Marxist perspective) is valuable only because
 it would take us a long time to refine and obtain it.
 Gold has value only because we agree to purchase it for a certain value.
 By itself it is a risk-less asset only because we value it.
 In complete chaos, it would have no value.
 It grows only because an order is maintained and economy keeps growing.
 The story with houses or any other asset is no different.
 It grows only because the economy grows.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 does not represent the growth in economy - but the risk in its growth is
 what represents the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the rise of disposable incomes is often observed to be linear
 (see the data from UK for example), we prefer the declining growth assumption
 over life-time more appropriate - due to life-cycle effects for the consumer.
 Even for the dynasties, the rise in prices would diminish the rise in incomes
 as wealth rises.
 Such a process is assumed to be known to the consumer.
 What she doesn't know is whether her own wealth would follow the same trajector
y - hence a risk process for wealth is assumed.

Aggregation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For aggregation consider a two persons economy.
 In one type of model the two persons have some basic needs that are satisfied
 by exchanging goods that they find or cultivate.
 In the presence of wealth, one would have a higher wealth than the other
 or would be more gifted than the other in finding more wealth (due to creativit
y or luck).
 The more creative or lucky individual might even pass on more wealth to
 her progeny and therefore at some point for the persons 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, without loss of generality we could have 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<<A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 might decide to exchange her different services where she takes very little
 risk and just gets an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 from the consumer.
 We use the income as a proportion of 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 because the income arrangement would be non-existent if the two individuals
 have the same level of assets.
 For each individual this process is 
\begin_inset Formula $dA=\Delta dt-\psi dt+\sigma(\psi)dW$
\end_inset

.
 Here, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 is the income received in the time 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the expenditure rate in time 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 - rate that also influences the risk someone takes for the future (more
 risk means more rewards).
 If someone takes zero risk, they keep all their income and continue to
 grow their wealth as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 is guaranteed.
 In a world where risk is rewarding and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 uncertain, the player would select 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

>0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are two players, the two may have the same assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 but a different appetite for risk.
 The assets of the risk-averse individual would fall behind the risk-seeking
 individual and an income-arrangement could be sought again.
 The need for the income arrangement is only to prevent an infinite gap
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 One would imagine that around 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}$
\end_inset

 (a more accurate condition would depend on the utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) income arrangement would switch.
 Only a form of 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A,\psi)$

\begin_inset Formula $u(A,p)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the probability of achieving the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can determine more precise time of the reversal.
 Such a utility should explain the framing scenarios as well - by noting
 that the individual with assets would be more reluctant to take risk as
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 grows (the CRRA models are a possible choice).

Summarising what we have so far, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}>>A_{1}$
\end_inset

, the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 already knows that she is better positioned to carry on the wealth creation
 activities and an exchange is born.
 The exchange would look like the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
dA_{1}=\delta(A_{2}-A_{1})dt-\psi_{1}dt+\sigma(\psi_{1})dW_{1}\\

\begin_layout Standard
Without the income arrangement, a consumer would choose to optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 by choosing a risk-profile.
 In this case, the variance only comes from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 term (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

).
 the form of utility would can thus be made specific under these conditions.
 A few choices are a CARA utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=1-e^{-\lambda A}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=-\frac{u''(A)}{u'(A)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>0$
\end_inset

 or CRRA utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=A^{1-\lambda}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=-\frac{Au''(A)}{u'(A)}$
\end_inset

.
 One approach is to consider - the other is to calibrate a probability function
 which the consumer chooses with.
 We compare both approaches with the above model.
 We assume that the time time-horizon does not come into picture and the
 consumer is only concerned with the immediate values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 It is often that a consumer is assumed to optimise the expected value of
 assets - but that isn't what consumers would do at a fundamental level.
 We can associate a probability function with the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{T}=A_{T}-A_{0}$
\end_inset

 to see how the consumer behaviour under probability acts.

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider briefly the dynamics of 
\begin_inset Formula $dA=-\psi Adt+\psi A\sigma dW$
\end_inset

.
 Here, the asset is not meant to grow.
 The consumer opt output by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=0$
\end_inset

 - if needs are uncertain, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would possibly decline to negative value.
 As long as the possibility of that happening is low, things work alright
 (we would like to bring the relative wealth concern by letting the consumer
 optimise two assets - but we focus on one consumer for now).
 A consumer cannot choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi>0$
\end_inset

 -so is 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A)=0\Rightarrow\psi=0$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming a CRRA utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\frac{A^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 .
 We know that for a lognormal 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)\sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$
\end_inset

 the expected utility 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(x))$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(x))=\frac{e^{\mu(1-\gamma)+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}(1-\gamma)^{2}-1}}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 (so that the certainty equivalent 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{CE}$
\end_inset

 for a consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{CE}=e^{\mu+\frac{(1-\gamma)}{2}\sigma^{2}}$
\end_inset

).
 One can optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(x))$
\end_inset

 by optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu+\frac{1-\gamma}{2}\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 For the dynamics, 
\begin_inset Formula $dA=-\psi Adt+\psi A\sigma dW\Rightarrow d(logA)=-\psi dt+\psi\sigma dW$
\end_inset

 , one can use Ito's lemma to infer 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)\sim N(-\psi-\frac{\psi^{2}\sigma^{2}}{2},\psi^{2}\sigma^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)$
\end_inset

 is optimised at an optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $-\psi-\frac{\psi^{2}\sigma^{2}}{2}+\frac{(1-\gamma)}{2}\psi^{2}\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 First order condition leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(1+\frac{\gamma\psi\sigma^{2}}{2})=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=0$
\end_inset

.
 This could be verified with a Monte Carlo simulation as well.

 Given

 We already have a stochastic environment that is imaginary and rewards
 the consumer based on a constant volatility (which is unrealistic) - so
 we don't wish to get more precise with these functions - we only consider

 is random, it is possible that over time the growth in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

is higher (this should be confirmed with a Monte Carlo Simulation

When 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}\rightarrow A_{1}$
\end_inset

 (including the possibility that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}=0$
\end_inset

), it would be possible for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 to employ consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{2}$
\end_inset

a situation that can only arise when 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}>\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 (except when 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}=\psi_{2}=0$
\end_inset

).
 In reality, we would not be available to be set to 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1},\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 and it might not be possible to bring 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 down by reducing 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The behaviour of the game when 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 also asks for consider what the true utility of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is.
 The consumer is consider a probability adjusted view of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 She may be willing to settle for 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

 only as long as she is risk-averse.
 The risk-adjusted view would still mean 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{1})>u(A_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 It still needs to be considered what exactly happens at the inflection
 point.
 In a equilibrium (Nash / Pareto?) the individuals would not gain anything
 by moving away from their chosen 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1},\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 (that is all what they variable they select in the game).
 The equilibrium would thus imply that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\forall i:\frac{du(p_{i},A_{1})}{d\psi_{i}} & =0
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

Thus neither consumer observes any utility by moving away from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

(the Pareto condition might not be met).
 To decide on the particular form of utility, we may treat 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 as the indication of probability.
 A more risk-averse consumer is likely to choose a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 Notice also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is bounded by income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta A$
\end_inset

.
 If a common 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 exists - i.e.
 if all the consumers face an environment where taking more risk uniform
 increases the chances of increasing wealth uniformly, a lower income would
 force the consumer to be risk-averse.
 We need to determine 
\series bold
the behaviour of a risk-neutral consumer in the model.
 This is the only thing that would make sense from a status consumption
 POV.
 
\series default
The consumer might decided to take more risk if she believes her chances
 are fairer than they may be.
 The utility is actually a combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the probability of it being stable - inverse variance.
 If the consumer faces a choice which would minimise the variance of her
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 over time then that probability can serve as the utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key point is to consider the condition under which the income arrangement
 is found.
 Consider the case when both consumers start with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 When would the income arrangement be formed? The formation of income arrangment
 is based on 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 alone - the short-termism of the consumer means only that she does not
 know the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 nor that it is influenced only by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (or that avenues to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 are limited by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

).
 It's the utility that must reflect this choice to take on a flat income
 rather than continuing to take the risk - this hasn't been clarified yet.
 We also need to see how 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1},\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 change with inc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer these questions consider a more general model where no normality
 assumption is made.
 Bernoulli trial provides an easier formulation at the individual levels.
 We don't have a sufficient background on whether distribution is known
 or not.
 We would need to consider a particular real-world source of uncertainty
 to provide a volatility surface.
 A general subjective probability function - on the other hand - provides
 a general model for the subjective probability which influences individual's
 choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

\begin_inset Formula $c$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can probabilistic change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (through bands of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

).
 But if we assume no changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, we can proceed by assuming that all consumers have there own 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

.
 The resources in the economy are limited by the rise in incomes and therefore
 some consumers would be more risk-seeking and others risk-averse.
 A risk-neutral consumer would however choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 so that her rise in asset is aligned with the increase in income (?).
 It's not very clear how 
\begin_inset Formula $d\psi$
\end_inset

 aggregates into 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 or how 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 changes in response to 
\begin_inset Formula $d\psi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-simplication is due to exchangeability is that all consumers have
 the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we may describe the model: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
dA=di-d\psi+\sigma(\rho,\psi)dW\\
di=\mu_{\rho}dt\Rightarrow dA=\mu_{\rho}dt-dc+\sigma(\rho,c)dW
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may exhaust the discussion of subjective probability in the current
 model.
 The next step is to see how the risk-perception would shape the selection
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 A more risk-seeking consumer is one who has 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(c,\rho)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A)>E(A^{*})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the expected asset growth of the risk-neutral consumer.
 The risk-neutral consumer is the one who maximises 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A,c))$
\end_inset

.
 This is possible only if her 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\rho,c)$
\end_inset

 is exactly the same as the population's true chance of promotion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to view this is a game where every consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 depending on her 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (the change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would bring the true justification for status consumption).
 There are a few questions that necessitate a clarification of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 changes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the consumer already knows the dependence of her selection on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, why would she not choose a 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 that is closer to somebody who is known to have a more accurate 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\rho,c)$
\end_inset

? If the types are static and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\rho,dc)$
\end_inset

 is known by the consumer, then she gains nothing by being risk-seeking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If there is a game where the poor and rich can participate? What does a
 wealthy consumer have to lose from? If she has no downside risk of being
 wealthy and having a stable income (no matter what she sets 
\begin_inset Formula $dc$
\end_inset

 to be) - then there is nothing worth participating for the consumer.
 The utility from status consumption has been our key argument for the model.
 Do the poor and the rich get a higher utility from participating in the
 same absolute level of status consumption? This cannot be answered without
 representing the promise social mobility? What is the promise of social
 mobility? If this is a probability? If this the weight of the probability
 - meaning a poor gives more weight to the probability of rise? In other
 words, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(c,p)=w\cdot p\cdot\upsilon(c)$
\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 higher for the poorer consumer.
 More needs to be clarified for this analysis? Are we tracking assets for
 the probability which the consumer gives weights to? More expected wealth
 would motivate the poorer consumer to move up while the same expected wealth
 may motivate the richer consumer.
 Target wealth is equivalent to probability weighting - and this is what
 shapes the non-durable consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A convenient form for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\rho,c)$
\end_inset

 might be 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\rho}log(c)$
\end_inset

 - as we're often concerned with the level of consumption.
 Another simplification that can be offered is by assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $c=mi$
\end_inset

 and therefore the equations can be reformulated in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
dA & =(1-m)\mu dt+\sigma(m,\rho,i)dW
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(m,\rho,i)$
\end_inset

 indicates that the risk the consumer chooses must depend on her consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 as well as income 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (apart from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 This complicates matters again.
 It makes more sense to suggest that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 change more slowly through 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or even 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Effectively the movement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (if at all) must be linked with the risk-perception.
 One may thereon clarify how the certain improvement 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-m)\mu$
\end_inset

 is preferred over the risky 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(m,\rho,i)$
\end_inset

.
 
\series bold
Two major questions thus arise

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How does 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $i,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What does a risk-neutral consumer do in the model? This cannot be answered
 without admitting that there is a risk faced by high 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (the rich who are favoured by the income process).
 If the rich also face a risk, then income process cannot have no risk.
 Again, in the developing countries there is just a lot of risk for everybody
 (even those who are rich) - compared to the developed countries where the
 risk is lower for everyone and higher for the ultra rich.
 If we already know that certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would perform a certain way - with career choices and long-term choices
 we make i.e.
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The latter consumption cannot be answered until we fix a utility function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Partial exchangeability is with respect to this statistic.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 matters only because a consumer.
 Going to a certain school or to a certain college would be good enough
 for the consumer to ascertain long-term success or class mobility.
 The partial exchangeability has a subjective role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exchangeability is the criteria for social classification.
 Despite same net worth, the very definition of social hierarchy means that
 a certain individuals with characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 have more access to certain services - simply because individuals (consider
 how black individuals would have trouble getting a cab in New York city
 - or a cab driver would ignore some passengers to go to an investment bank
 rink).
 These are not because of prejudices but the long-term secuirty perceived
 by individuals - which directly influence actions (for provision or availing
 of services).
 The role of exchangeability would justify the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - having a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would give you access in non-durable terms.
 Long-term is often changed due to limiting this type of access anyways.
 Consumption is limited due to exchangeability or does it improve exchangeabilit
y? It's not clear - what's clear is that a subjective behaviour does not
 consider things as exchangeable as the real world processes would.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
A Needs as investment model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth consider needs but only as investments to improvement of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of saying that non-needs go to status promotion, we can start viewing
 that all needs are investments of some sort and directly contribute.
 Status consumption is merely a hope for mobility and nothing else.
 The desire to get ahead of others enhanced this mobility in real terms
 (not just in perception).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's assume that there is no difference between observed and perceived
 probability.
 In this simplified model, all non-needs must contribute to the expected
 probabilistic growth in income or assets.
 Let's develop a model with income being the only stochastic process - which
 just one uncertainty that is known by every consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To consider whether a model with stochastic 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 makes sense, let's consider a user who receives an income increase 
\begin_inset Formula $di$
\end_inset

, she may invest this amount in some assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that would give a certain rise in income (a conventional asset) or add
 it to the consumption which would improve the income less certainly.
 A certain cost of having assets can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A)$
\end_inset

 is seen as the participation cost so that the consumer can either open
 up this opportunity to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(A)$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $dA$
\end_inset

.
 This can also be seen as the depreciation associated with assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 If there was no income then the assets would depreciate to 0.
 However, the consumer makes sure that there is some 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at all times to maintain some 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If all consumption is also an investment (expense) of some sort, then the
 consumer would only want to improve 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (not caring about consumption with is encapsulated in 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A)$
\end_inset

 ).
 This would be like a dynasty.
 There are 3 questions that remain

\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A)$
\end_inset

 must directly contribute to the risk consumer takes.
 Otherwise, there is very little motive for taking the risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 For example, in the more developed market, one expects to see rental options,
 availability of cheaper substitutes or extension of credit facilities to
 the consumer for an durable good that is too expensive for her.
 This contrast in the supply conditions would have two effects on the consumer
 demand.
 First, the difference between successive asset costs in an order of assets

 Second, a lot of assets can be availed without ownership in the developed
 market.
 To consider a particular example of car ownership, we would see both that
 the cars can be enjoyed with a frequent non-durable cost (rental) rather
 than through ownership and that the cars are available in a wider range
 of costs in the developed market.
 Standardsing the supply conditions in the two economies with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 would imply a less discrete distribution of assets in the developed market
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) so that the same level of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 may correspond to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho$
\end_inset

) in the developed market.

Addendum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such the weighting probability has no role in dynamics - unless we assume
 an as if scenario - where consumer acts as if the probability in asset
 growth dynamics (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 is according to the weight of the probability.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the only control that consumer decides with.
 Every 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 would correspond to a lottery who value is calculated with PT.
 An optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is selected based on the assumption that the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is observed by the consumers (no subjectivity when considering 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

).
 Thus when we consider the case with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 for different consumers (i.e.
 consumers 1 and 2 in our example).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The role of probability weighting functions also shows how a belief in unlikely
 jump 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 more expenditure on status consumption) would have an influence on consumption.

\begin_layout Standard
Given the dynamics in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:Bernoulli_dynamics"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, a consumer faces the asset choice 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t+1}=A_{t}-\delta\psi+\sigma(\psi)X_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(X_{t}=1)=p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(X_{t}=0)=1-p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is non-negative.
 Therefore, the consumer evaluates the lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(A_{t}-\delta\psi+\sigma(\psi),p),(A_{t}-\delta\psi,1-p)\}$
\end_inset

.
 Using a weighting function 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)=\frac{p^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}$
\end_inset

 and a value function 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(A)$
\end_inset

, the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\psi)$
\end_inset

 which the consumer optimises is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
u(\psi) & =\sum w(p)\upsilon(A_{t+1})
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's assume a reference points 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

, the lottery's value would be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
u(\psi) & =\frac{p^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t}-\delta\psi+\sigma(\psi)-A')+\frac{(1-p)^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t}-\delta\psi-A')
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
We can now arrive at the specifics form of the utlility function by choosing
 the forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

, the value function 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(A)$
\end_inset

 and the references points.
 We can for example use 
\begin_inset Formula $A'=\frac{A_{1}+A_{2}}{2}$
\end_inset

 and the PT value function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\upsilon(\Delta) & =\begin{cases}
\Delta^{\gamma} & \Delta\ge0\\
-\lambda(-\Delta)^{\gamma} & \Delta<0
\end{cases}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's interesting is that if we have high-risk activities - utilities from
 a high and low 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 are the same - i.e.
 the equilibrium may exists with two different 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 having the same utility.
 The size of this dip depends on the risk-aversion (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

).
 But more interesting is that having a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 does result in utilities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this simply the nature of utility functions? Why should we even try to
 use PT? There are only two reasons.
 First, is the loss-aversion (i.e.
 the consumer dislikes losses more than she likes profits ) and the second
 is the non-linear effect of probability.
 A risk-averse individual would see the same opportunity differently.
 The non-stochastic approach didn't account for these difference while our
 PT approach only incorporates these two in the model.

 risk-aversion

Now we can extend this function to two consumers who differ in their risk-appeti
tes (probability weighting functions controlled by 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 in the case of Karmakar probability weighting funtion) but are equally
 loss-averse (given a mid-point reference point).
 In this simple case, we also assume that there is not much social stratificatio

 Thus, the same

 is observed.

\begin{gather*}

The equilibria arrived at by first-order conditions are independent in the
 non-stochastic case.
 Extending the above to the case with income-redistribution as before:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
u_{1}(\psi_{1})=\frac{p^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t,1}-\delta\psi_{1}+\sigma(\psi_{1})-A'+\tau(A_{t,2}-A_{t,1}-\delta(\psi_{2}-\psi_{1})+\sigma(\psi_{2})-\sigma(\psi_{1})))+\frac{(1-p)^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t,1}-\delta\psi_{1}-A'+\tau(A_{t,2}-A_{t,1}-\delta(\psi_{2}-\psi_{1}))\\
u_{2}(\psi_{2})=\frac{p^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t,2}-\delta\psi_{2}+\sigma(\psi_{2})-A'-\tau(A_{t,2}-A_{t,1}-\delta(\psi_{2}-\psi_{1})+\sigma(\psi_{2})-\sigma(\psi_{1})))+\frac{(1-p)^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}\upsilon(A_{t,2}-\delta\psi_{2}-A'-\tau(A_{t,2}-A_{t,1}-\delta(\psi_{2}-\psi_{1}))
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the equilibria would be sought with a stochastic term as well.
 The risk-taking is therefore shared.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we embarked upon was a question whether an appropriate mixutre of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 used suitable.
 The uncertainty in intertemporal method is unnecssary complicated due to
 inappropriate use of uncertainty.
 The notion of subjective probability allows this to simply specification.
 The approach on endoginigin consumption as part of the evolution of total
 assets allows us to include status consumption - as an access to status.
