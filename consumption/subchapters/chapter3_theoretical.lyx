\begin_layout Title
Status as uncertainty in consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is derived based on the framework for intertempor
al consumption choice in the presence of long-term assets.
 Status is endogenised as states of financial stability and included as
 part of the consumer's utility in the intertemporal model for substitution
 between quality in non-durable consumption and savings for future assets.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
If consumers optimised status with both non-durable consumption, If the
 end goal of the consumer was to maximise her wealth where non-durable consumpti
on was both and expense and a risky jump in social ranking.
 Consider education - where less expenditure guaranteed to disadvantage.
 Education is both an expense and investment.
 If we observe only such expenses i.e.
 those which affect savings but also increase the wealth by a certain probabilit
y.
 This increase is only a proxy of increase in status which would increase
 the income in a more realistic model.
 In this simple model, there is no income and therefore investments increase
 with a certain probability as if wealth too increased.
 Since the rich have something to lose in this game the know that by not
 taking too much risk i.e.
 by lowering 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, they would lose out on the risk.
 As the rich are loss-averse, they would also like to keep their rich position.
 These are endognised in a model.
 Status consumption - in the general sense that Veblen had talked about
 - includes educations and should be viewed as this risky investment.
 The model of risk-sharing is obviously more general and applies to industrial
 organisation and politics as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The studies on conspicuous consumption tend to explore a specific instance
 of status consumption.
 Here, conspicuous consumption is expected to occur through a certain type
 of (visible) goods that are meant to be futile for the general needs of
 the consumer.
 This assumption allows us to use to the separability of demand for visible
 goods.
 Before we can assume that much of status consumption occurs through visible
 commodities (clothing, shoes, jewelry etc.) in the developing economies,
 we revisit the framework of demand with a consideration of risk associated
 with the promotion through social rank advancement so as to view status
 consumption in a more general context.
 While such a model might does not benefit from the tractability that the
 models for visible consumption benefit from, the inclusion of the estimates
 of wealth of the consumer (e.g.
 asset ownership in consumer data), if available, may provide some necessary
 insights into status consumption by observe how quality across commodities
 is consumed with respect to the wealth of the consumer.

Such a framework helps us answer if the consumers in one economy may engage
 in status consumption more than they do in another.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 to effectually mend the consumerâ€™s good fame it must be an expenditure

 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

The advancements in game theory and statistics from the last century - particula
rly the theory of decision under risk - can explain some of the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour that Veblen had observed in the late
 19th century.
 The effect that social conditions have on human behaviour remains an area
 of active research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"

\end_inset

.
 However, the theory of decision under risk (see von Neumann-Morgenstern
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VonNeumannMorgenstern1944"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) has successfully explained many of the apparent paradoxes in human behaviour
 (see Dhami 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 It is possible - within the remit of this theory - to view status consumption
 i.e.
 the disproportionate spending on goods that only have a status (or visible)
 appeal as an instance of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour.
 We inherit from the literature on habit formation and visible consumption
 while adopting this approach to status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature from behavioural economics, marketing research and development
 economics all seem to concur on the tendencies of habit formation in consumer
 behaviour.
 The measurement of changes in habits and quality has a long tradition in
 neoclassical economics (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment of the problem).
 Of particular interest is the model for myopia amongst consumers described
 by Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who had noted the significance of lagged consumption on aggregate consumption.
 The life-cycle model used by Muellbauer has been of considerable importance
 in more recent studies on consumption where a rational utility-optimising
 consumer balances between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned savings over her life-time i.e.
 in an intertemporal substitution setting (a problem often treated equivalent
 to the classical utility maximising consumption problem).
 Improving upon the classical approach where the consumer is subservient
 to her optimised plan for life-time savings and consumption, a few behavioural
 approaches (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for example) have sought descriptive models for mental accounting and factors
 such as willpower to better understand the development of habits in consumers.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice, the
 representative consumer in such models is subject to overeating, overspending,
 accumulating items she doesn't need or acquiring habits she cannot afford.

The literature from sociological studies has long indicated the role that
 industrial goods and income rises play in addressing of status needs by
 the consumers (see Srinivas

 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (referred to as

 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 Elsewhere too, rapid industrialisation has created a disproportionate change
 in lifestyles with a crowding effect towards urbanisation (see https://www.dukeu
press.edu/lifebuoy-men-lux-women).
 A quantiative analysis of such works has been of limited scope - particularly
 becuse of unobserved nature of identified factors in many of such studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent literature on conspicuous consumption focuses on a particular instnace
 of status consumption i.e.
 conscpicuous consumption which is assumed to bring no utility in the regular
 sense (see Ireland

).
 The argument - often attributed to Veblen allows one to consider the utility
 for visible consumption separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (we refer to this assumption as the futility assumption henceworth).
In the current chapter, we we follow a slightly different approach based
 on the intertemporal substitution problem - where we introduce snob and
 bandwagon behaviour as the fundamental mechanisms for any status utility.
 This allows us to include wealth differences and quality in an intertemporal
 setting - where the competing behaviours of snob and bandwagon items are
 subject to the uncertainty perceived by the consumer
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor
 that they belong to a club that poor don't (invidious comparison).
 We have found Corneo's terminology more tractable for empirical analyses

\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such an uncertainty-based notion of status can be seen a state of wealth
 representing the long-term security of the consumer from extreme income
 fluctuations.
 This is the sense in which status is interpreted in health and sociological
 sciences literature - which often track status with a vector of income,
 education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 However, a demand equation for status goods that considers status as a
 mere demograhic vector ignores the dynamic nature of status and bandwagon
 items.
 Status is a social psychological concern and is often observed at the level
 of a social unit (individual or a reference group).
 So while a researcher observing a population of consumers may interpret
 the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk associated with the transition
 to the highest band of net-worth in the long-term as status, the consumer
 necessarily has a subjective view of her status which is influenced by
 locacl factors averaged out at highe leelss.
 
\bar under
The two perspectives may 
\bar default
not need to disagree, but the consumer's view of status could consider the
 socio-political conditions which she perceives from within a particular
 social unit (family, community, ethnicity or region) more important than
 what an economist us concerned wtth.
 A vuew if status onsumption is necessarily localised (tied to reference
 level) - where socio-cultural factors matter more than the observed variables
 that are standardised over a large area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the long-term, a high-status individual is someone who has either or
 both of high income and a high (inter-generational) probability to move
 towards the high income group (stability).
 Let's call this the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of wealth transition (i.e.
 a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{ij}\}$
\end_inset

 representing the transition from wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) - which the researcher observes.
 A low-status individual - similarly - is someone who has either or both
 of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 The researcher - concerned with the long-term effect of such factors to
 the asset ownership and stability of income - may assume that all consumers
 observe the same probability of transition to higher state of income but
 the consumer would be motivated by the particular short-term concerns with
 respect to the social unit that influence her view of status and self-image.
 Thus the uncertainty of wealth transition is observed at multiple levels
 in this subjective formulation of probability.
 The probability of material wealth transition that a consumer associates
 with the future is fundamentally subjective - although determined largely
 by factors related to social or regional identity.
 For the purposes of this discussion, we consider this latter sense as 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability of wealth transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that status consumption (other than the standardised variables)
 depends on a 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 (personal) uncertainty one attaches to possible future states of wealth
 and use the decision theory framework to understand status consumption
 as a choice of excess non-durable consumption vs long-term ownership of
 assets.
 The consumer's 
\shape italic
subjective 
\shape default
probability is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as her
 occupation, education, social or familial background, personality types
 etc.
 and is subject to change over the her lifetime.
 Since consumption is usually myopic, such a view would influence consumption
 at all times.
 The notion of status, self-reference and peer effects all influence the
 risk-seeking behaviour of the consumer which are captured in the consumer's
 subjective probability function

If 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\{(x_{i},p_{i})\}$

 s.t.

\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 the probability of obtained the payoff 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

, risk-seeking behaviour is exhibited for a consumer who values the prospect
 higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $E(L)=\sum p_{i}x_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The risk-averse behaviour is expected when the prospect is valued lower
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $E(L)$
\end_inset

.
 It is well known that the consumers don't behave according to the expected
 (concave) utility.
 To separate the effect of uncertainty on decision making from the effect
 of payoffs in a non-concave utility function, one often views the utility
 as a product of the consumer's utility for payoffs 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(x)$
\end_inset

 and probability weighting function 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 so that they act according to 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(L))=\sum w(p_{i})\upsilon(x_{i})$
\end_inset

 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)=p$
\end_inset

 leads one back to the expected utility case.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability.
 On the other hand, the growth in the income and wealth of the consumer,
 unlike the subjective probability which drives consumption in the near
 term, are constrained with long-term economic conditions and can be assumed
 to be associated with a different probability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that in the long-term there is no difference between
 the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probabilities.
 So while the non-durable consumption of the consumers would be associated
 with their view in the short-term, in the long-term what matters are whether
 they have achieved a higher state of wealth (and thus status) or not.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider three consumers with different
 occupations in a microeconomy - an academic, a sportsperson and an investor
 - who all share the share the same reference point (by assumption) for
 wealth.
 They all estimate the probability of doubling their wealth in the lifetime
 so that they may retire on the successful achievement of their goal.
 Given the nature of the profession, it is likely that the sportsperson
 overestimates the probability of her success until the middle of her career
 - after which the probability she associates to the success of doubling
 her wealth (if she hasn't already) would decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus a risk-seeking behaviour would be associated with a sportsperson much
 the way a risk-averse behaviour is associated with the academic who may
 be well aware of the limited probabilty of a windfall in the short-term.
 On the other hand, an investor may be after a definite gain over a fixed
 term and have a risk-profile that lies somewhere in between that of the
 sportperson and the academic.
 While the long-term decisions of the sportsperson may still be determined
 by the knowledge of expected income, a sportsperson would be characteristised
 by the belief in an unlikely probability of success in the near-term in
 a way that is different from how an academic or an investor would foresee
 her wealth transition.
 If we can assume that the three consumers have the same basic needs, it
 is extremely unlikely that the consumption of the three individuals would
 be independent of how they view the transition probability of their monetary
 wealth in the near term.
 Still in the long-term is only their success in montery terms that may
 drive their status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To state whether a risk-seeking consumer spends more or less on non-durable
 consumption we need to understand what goals of the consumer are in an
 intertemporal setting (where status consumption may appear to be less beneficia
l than saving for assets).
 This is developed in the later sections.
 It is worth pointing out at this stage however that in an economy with
 more than three consumers (as in the above example), the risk-profiles
 (such as those of an academic, sportsperson and the investor) are also
 influenced by the peer effects that induce non-durable consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assist an empirical view of the above outline of a model, we define a
 long-term asset as a durable goods that may benefit the consumer regardless
 of her risk-appetite.
 A risk-seeking individual would get more utility from the non-durable consumpti
on than the risk-averse individidual even though a long-term durable good
 is equally desirable by both (this is possible because long-term durable
 goods are of infinite life).

 the relation between loss-aversion and possessions.
 If the long-term assets can be considered as part of the wealth that can
 be passed on to generations, the short-term concerns of the consumer (which
 are influenced by the acquired wealth) comprise only of needs and quality.
 In other words, if there is any status related utility to be derived from
 non-durable consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from quality
 (which is defined as distance from needs).
 This is because a consumer with a habit of high-quality in consumption
 (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfilment of consumer needs itself carries no such influence on status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we associate non-durable consumptioin with subjective probability, the
 status-related consumption (primarily non-durable consumption) is exhibited
 as a risk-seeking behaviour i.e.
 when the 
\shape italic
subjective 
\shape default
probability is much higher than the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability.
 Those who are hoping to enhance their social network or get ahead of others
 through signaling (or peer effects) are likely to believe in a higher likelihoo
d of their promotion to a higher status (a higher probability corresponding
 to a state promotion - resulting in a higher utility for the same observed
 probability for a consumer with higher belief).
 The perceived probability of loss of one's status may similarly be higher
 (e.g.
 that of threat of immigration to one's personal wealth) than the

observed
\shape default
 probability in the long-term.

\begin_layout Standard
It is worthwhile to dwell upon the micro-economic processes that represent
 the interplay of the two levels of uncertainties.
 We could view these uncertainties as an expression of delay or barriers
 in the flow of information related to risks in the consumer markets.
 When it comes to risks to the future wealth, the firms and institutions
 are often both better equipped and more responsive than the individuals
 or small communities.
 The barrier to information - are key in understanding the limits to the
 free-market assumption which considers an autonomous consumer fully capable
 of addressing her true needs.
 The differences in purchasing power between sections of a society and their
 desire for mobility might as well drive the consumption and the economy
 (see Smith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmithMoralSentiments"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 as well as a recent discussion in Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) but the implicit assumption in the free market view of an exchange between
 the rich and poor sections driving economic progress is that the consumer
 has full information of the risks and incentives related to her income
 (or the economy functions in a way that these risks are known to the consumer).
 The barriers to the flow of information - which a consideration of two
 uncertainties attempts to model - could partly explain why this exchange
 may be less feasible in more recent times (see Hirsch
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Such barriers or delays subject to the fundamental changes in an economy
 such as rapid industrialisation, advertising effects, centralisation of
 markets or their expansion.
 As long as it can be admitted that the information about socio-economic
 changes is consumed at different speeds and extent amongst the consumers
 than firms then it must follow that the information of risks is not considered
 fully by the consumer.
 Thus the consumption in the short-term is likely to be influenced by asymmetrie
s in the observation of risk.
 On the other hand, it is also true that the beliefs of the consumers do
 not matter in the long run - since the resources in the world are influenced
 by the actions taken on beliefs rather than beliefs themselves.
 This is why observing the long-term durable consumption (which is the mark
 of long-term status) is required to reconcilie the consumers' subjective
 probability functions.
 In the long-term the consumer beliefs reflect in the changes in long-term
 assets - likely by letting the the risk-averse behaviours balance the risk-seek
ing behaviour in the population of consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formulation of subjective probability allows us provide a more descriptive
 model of consumption under uncertainty.
 Consider a world where the perceived probability and observed probability
 were the same.
 
\bar under
Here, a lower material status (i.e.
 lower wealth, lower education etc.) would encourage the consumer to save
 for high-cost assets or invest in characteristics that enhance her success
 and rather than indicating status through high quality in certain categories
 (e.g.
 luxury items
\bar default
) that are meant to accompany high-status.
 If status is simply the long-term view of wealth, then leaving others behind
 in non-durable consumption is futile.
 When subjective probability is not the same as the observed probability,
 the consumers would not view the true observed probability of their mobility
 and their wants (which they estimate through a perceived probability )
 may not achieve their long-term needs.
 The status consumption must exist whenever the perceived probability is
 different from the observed probability and need not exist when the perceived
 probability is the same the observed probability.

 The fundamental claim of the PIH is that income has a transitory and a
 permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional to the
 permanent component
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components
\end_layout

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain

cancellation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 Friedman's assumption of the independence (zero-correlation) between the
 transitory component and the permanent component - is a condition stronger
 than what one may require if the non-durable consumption was viewed in
 the intertemporal substitution frameork.
 Instead of the zero-correlation assumption, we model the uncertainty explicitly
 in the utility.
 While PIH observes the dispersion in income amongst socio-economic classes
 (gauged with a simple variance in past income), we are also interested
 in the dispersion in quality and wealth owing to social hierarchy.
 Thus unlike PIH, we also do not explicitly ignore the role of

 (which can be incorporated in PIH), status-related consumption is an aberration
 if the consumer is meant to always achieve the goal of improving her wealth
 by minimising the volatility of income streams.
 It could be argued more generally that a rational consumer predicting future
 incomes based on the past incomes would have no reason to engage in any
 status related consumption at all (neither in short-term nor in long-term).
 If conspicuous consumption were truly futile, then there would be no way
 for the rational consumer to derive any utility from status-related consumption
 either.
 Include status consumption in the consumer's demand for quality and assets,
 we assign an explicit advantage to how consumers may set themselves apart
 from others to achieve higher utility in the short-term and acquire assets
 in the long-term (as the consumption of quality is of no significance in
 the long-term).
 Therefore the explicit subjective uncertainty we attach to to the advantage
 that one receives from status consumption - allow the representative consumer
 to benefit from status consumption and deviate from her long-term plans.
 Unlike in PIH, the uncertainties associated with the short-term preferences
 and the long-term preferences are not independent of each other.
 Even though no consumer may truly know the probability of change in states
 of wealth, the consumer can estimate this probability around a long-term
 process

 The long-term assets is what reconciles the two uncertainties.
 The items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 are considered long-term assets while those that cannot be passed are considere
d short-term.
 The observed probability is contributed to by the assets transferred between
 generations in the long-run as there is little more than the net asset
 worth of the individual - whose probability is determined by factors more
 tangible than perception i.e.
 factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.
 - that are passed over as inheritance.
 The subjective probability of success through social interactions and the
 high quality consumption associated with it need not matter in the long-term
 as the path to net asset worth may completely ignore the non-durable consumptio
n habits of the past.
 Unlike with a permanent income approach the two uncertainties are thus
 not expected to be independent of each other but are reconciled by transfer
 and ownership of long-term assets in the economy.

Our view of

conspicuous consumption as
\bar default
 non-durable consumption may appear in conflict the its view in the public
 discourse where it is often presented as a phenomenon that only-serves-the-rich.
 Even though a conspicuous item is seen as an item that is used both to
 distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself, there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst
 the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 We admit a more general definition of status consumption which considers
 conspicuous consumption a way to distinguish oneself from one's own reference
 group and the reference wealth level through consumption would.
 If we can agree that the signaling behaviour can be exhibited by everyone
 and cause a direct (albeit probabilistic) improvement of the consumer's
 perceived status, then an increase in her consumption corresponding to
 her perceived status is justified.
 Further, if the long-term consumption is defined as assets that stay the
 same over many generations (so that all else is considered non-durable)
 then a focus on non-durable sufficiently captures the sense of conspicuous
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason to object to the view of status consumption as a consumption
 exclusive to the rich is that the utility to the rich from status consumption
 might be quite little given the fact that the rich consumer already has
 enough to distance herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have
 anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave
 anyone behind).
 We argue instead that even the poorest may want to indicate that they are
 not the poorest - much the way richest may want it to be known to the others
 that they are indeed the richest

 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items

Public/Private, Reconciliation:
\series default
 The claim that perceived status is matched with consumption implies that
 there is a probabilistic private utility to be derived from conspicuous
 consumption.
 A luxury watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared to
 its cheaper alternatives with same functionality), but if an aspiring businessm
an uses his knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business,
 then the futile consumption can translate into a material advantage.
 The perception of status - however unrealistic - can influence one's wealth
 if everyone in one's reference group also acts in accordance to the perception.
 It may be apt to consider conspicuous consumption futile but only in a
 sense that is different from what a modeler would be concerned with.
 Items like luxury watches are important only because the rich flock around
 them.
 Thus if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
 However, the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may offer is
 important as it acts as a means of connecting the rich with the not-so
 rich.
 A belief in social mobility is therefore key to status consumption - which
 as part of high-quality consumption - offers an advantage to the representative
 consumer that is driven by a small chance of success - a probability which
 the consumer is likely to overestimate or underestimate.
 In the example of luxury watches, we know that only a few of the purchasers
 of luxury watches would improve their self-image and enhance their social
 networks - others would remain mere purchasers.
 As explained before, we are not concerned with how many of the businessmen
 actually believe that conspicuous consumption would help them (i.e.
 we do not attempt to describe their beliefs) - as we are only interested
 in how many buyers of luxury watches actually achieve success over the
 long term.
 Their purchase of luxury watches would indicate their perceived probability
 of success while the rises in their incomes would indicate the observed
 probability where the characteristics other than luxury watch ownership
 may dominate.

Income and Assets in the intertemporal model:

The intertemporal model relies on income savings, an interest rate of growth
 and depreciation.
 The literature tends to use a depreciation factor based on education and
 social classes (demographic variables provide the discount factor in the
 utility function see Cagetti

 ) .
 The simplest instance of such a model would look to associate the certain
 and uncertain parts of consumption with the respective parts of the consumer's
 status.
 That the consumer may deviate from her long-term plans introduces an explicit
 uncertainty in the model - since a consumer has limited knowledge of the
 future states of her wealth.
 At the same time, the growth of her income process - is independent of
 the subjective probability (of a higher probability to landing in a state
 of higher status than what is known through more deterministic trends of
 income) that inflence the non-durable consumption - which is essentially
 a short-run compared to the long-term consumption.
 If a consumer status were determined solely with status and income, then
 a natural attempt would be to associate consumption - determined with subjectiv
e componetns (social factors) from the income (which is determined by the
 social stratum as well as the consumer's long-term goals).
 We could thus associate long-term equilibrium with income.

 The consumption and accumulation of wealth can thus both be associated
 with more uncertain means while decision for long-term purchases can be
 associated with choices of income.
 As such a consumer must get status from not just assets but also from non-durab
le consumption (relative to the consumption level in her reference group)
 - without which, there would be no reason for the status consumption to
 exists in the market.

 What needs are not met would be seen either as low-quality or low-asset.

 Given this relationship, we would find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 would move with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - first because the non-durable consumption changes also changes the perception
s of wealth and richer consumer would have more disposable income.
 Second, the consumer may want to improve quality instead of saving for
 an asset, the quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may not be improved beyond a certain point until more assets are purchased.
 For example, high prices of housing may encourage the consumer to upgrade
 accessories such as furniture (thus improve 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) but she may improve the quality instead of buying a bigger house only
 until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 The covement of quality in non-durable consumption makes the substitution
 between assets and non-durable consumption to be limited and allows us
 to express the utility function in additive form such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(A,\nu)=f(A)+m(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 Another consequence of the limited substitution between low-quality asset
 and high-quality non-durable consumption is that the quality differences
 in the assets can be ignored.
 We have adopted this approach in the previous chapter - which relies on
 an exogenous income process that reconciles the long-term process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such an approach relies on the assumption that depreciation is stable and
 well-defined.
 In reality, however depreciation is not constant.
 To elucidate the role that uncertainty might play in the consumer, we take
 a more theoretical understanding of the choice made by the consumer as
 our goal is not so much to understand data in the current chapter.
 Depreciation in this model is implicit as the decline in assets is only
 through direct expenditure - which in turns consistas only of consumption
 or investment.
 We do not differentiate between needs and investments in this model.
 The assets are always depreciated - and all non-durable consumption is
 part of the decline in the asset possession either expense - which may
 be needs or investment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An assumption we make that investments (indistinguishable from needs) are
 hoped to increase the asset in some way.
 The expectation of growth in one's assets is therefore embedded in the
 expenditure one makes.
 Anyhing that is not expended contributes to the save wealth for the consumer.
 Another simplification is that long-term assets is indistiguishable from
 measures of wealth.
 It would be left to the empirical method to define how assets are interpreted.
 We contrast two approaches - one where the there is no uncertainty given
 the above setting - while the consumer competes with thother.
 The other setting is one where the the relative income concerns developed
 in an uncertain environment.

 other than the life-time of the asset- which we consider as a combined
 net asset worth - there is no economic justification of depreciation as
 such.
 So we could assume that over generations assets either can be maintained
 with investment instead of assuming a natural depreciation.
 In the presence of both non-durable consumption (which includes investments
 and consumption) and purchase of durable goods- both of which contribute
 to consumer's long-term utility, we incorporate that the perceived status
 or a

 Staying in an elite non-durable consumption club offers only a probabilistic
 benefit in the sense that being in the club for generations would eventually
 get you in the rich club (even the probability is quite low).
 This is where with motivate a choicen among lotteires- the consumer would
 place a bet either with a a pot of gold or without a pot of gold in in
 deciding whether the money she gets should be spent on education to get
 moderately rich over a few generations (higher probability) or spend it
 all to be a part of the club (low probability).
 This is the risk-profile that determines their selection of the lottery.
 The same likelihood may be too risky or not risky enough for different
 consumers.

Indeed the subjective probabilities do need to reconcile.
 Over time, therefore the population of risk-averse individiuals would be

 underlying uncertainties in income, it's useful to assume a transition

Sink of Gold

 To accentuate the upside risk in investments, let's consider a gold rush
 economy - where more digging increases the chances of getting higher wealth.
 With new money everywhere, investments to be made otherwise the current
 wealth would quickly deplete with consumption and there is nobody with
 basic needs not met.
 This is also a situation where relative wealth matters more - if the participan
t gets content (and doesn't dig more) the wealth would be disappear quickly.
 Digging can be seen as an expenditure or an investment (In a less extreme
 example, education or club memberships can be seen as such an investment).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question that concerns the model how digging (taking more risk
 increases wealth).
 This can indeed get complicated if we include income too in the model (and
 attempt to argue that gold is a windfall and not income in the usual sense
 - or argue that gold is income whereas consumption is driven by the asset
 account etc.).
 The needs are ignored - therefore if a rich were to give up her wealth,
 she would dig and maintain a minimal set of wells that just enough to have
 her basic needs fulfilled.
 The argument for ignoring needs is simple - instead of worrying about whether
 there is a basic level or not - we just care about which the target future
 wealth that consumer has in mind.
 It is worth emphasising that the consumers are dynasties and thus the life-cycl
e effects can be ignored.
 We assume a process that scales the the probability with the effort (or
 investment) 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 so that an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is rewarded to the consumer - where
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a random variable and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$

 is a general function with diminishing returns (digging more mines cannot
 infinitely increase one's wealth at a non-decreasing rate).

The second question is how exactly does 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 influence the evolution of total wealth

 As such more 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 must imply a more rapid depletioin of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 Therefore consumption is the way of depreciation.
 There is no inherent depreciation in the wealth - except through consumption.
 In presence of uncertainty, the rich can lose if they don't take risks
 and they don't share their wealth through more digging (this effectively
 shares the wealth through creation of jobs in an economy - but we revisit
 this in aggregation and taxation).
 We first view a non-stochastic approach and see how the above properties
 can be modeled.
 We then compare the stochastic approach.

 comprise of her wealth i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\Delta A}{A}=-\psi$
\end_inset

.
 If utility is only achieved from wealth, then she would have no incentive
 to raise spend this rate of depreciation as to prolong the lifetime of
 the wealth she possesses.
 If we have two consumers who both observe each other's wealth then too,
 the consumer has no incentive to increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degenerate case is not of any practical use - also because there is
 nothing that levels the relative wealth of the two consumers.
 A form that may provide some incentive to the poorer consumer is one where
 an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is available to both the rich and poor consumer.
 Therefore, the consumer gets to change the destiny of her wealth as a new

 comes along, the consumer would be encouraged to spend more of her wealth
 and hope to bridge gap between wealth.
 Notice that the consumer does not choose between saving for assets and
 expending in this case - she merely wishes to compete for the total assets
 (hence no budget equation).
 In other words, the consumer would take a loan and have more assets only
 that she would have to bear the cost of credit (which in an ideal world
 are the same as taxes on the wealth).

 In other words, if the consumers only cared about relative wealth then
 there is no reason for the consumer 2 to allow

 both in within period and across periods i.e.
 the intertemporal substitution).
 Some part of wealth - which is in transit (as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

) is of a separate value for wealth comparisons.
 The second is to view either just 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

( or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) adjusted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 respectively).
 In this latter form, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is all that is visible - so that there is a fair game between consumer
 1 and 2.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 matters but only in the providing the upper bound for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (poorer consumer cannot afford too much 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 This second option may make little sense when the differences in wealth
 are acute and a fair game based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is hardly plausible (the poor consumer's 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is not going to be of much value in the fair game).
 In such a case, we cannot ignore the role that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 plays.
 A model considering only 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 does not model any sense of mobility until we introduce uncertainty in
 the perception of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

Yet another way to introduce some dynamism in the setting is by introducing
 a mechanism of redistribution of wealth.
 Introducing, an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 and investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 as well as a redistribution process may sound unnecessary but this could
 represent the real world schemes of redistribution e.g.
 taxation where the wealthy consumer pays a higher absolute amount - only
 because extreme differences in wealth are to be avoided in order for both
 the players to participate.
 In a simple extension of the the model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dynamics_expenditure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 above, we may a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 on relative wealth which is transferred to the poorer consumer.
 The dynamics in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dynamics_expenditure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 can be rewritten as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
A_{t+1,1}=A_{1}-\delta(A_{t,1}+\pi\psi_{1}+\tau(A_{2}-A_{1}))+\pi\psi_{1}+\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})\label{eq:dynamic_nonstoch_w_redist}\\
A_{t+1,2}=A_{2}-\delta(A_{t,2}+\pi\psi_{2}-\tau(A_{2}-A_{1}))+\pi\psi_{2}-\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})\nonumber 
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 transferred to the poorer consumer reduces to 0 when both the consumers
 achieve the same wealth (i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 This is particularly interesting when utility is derived both from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - as it gives the dynamics the characteristics of a zero sum game.
 With such a redistribution in place, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $>A_{1}$
\end_inset

then the consumer might want to keep 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}/A_{1}$
\end_inset

 low only to get some utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 (rather than giving the amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 An appropriate form of 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A,\psi)$

 point in the above equation.

 We consider the case when the reference point is simply a mid-point between

 To arrive at a solution we can assume a form of the cost-function.
 Since the cost of assets are disproportionately higher for the ultra rich
 as function such as

\end_inset

 would make sense.
 When the costs of being rich are sudden as is the case in very unequal
 societies, a more appropriate function would be.
 This choice seems rather aribrary - and the structure of cost-function
 depends on a lot of factors not immediately related to the budget constraint
 (i.e.
 purchase cost of assets).

Stochastic Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The leap to the real world involves uncertainty both in the perception of
 the invididual and pursuits of mankind.
 A wealthy person must increase investments to maintain her wealth.
 As she competes with others and guards her income, she has no choice but
 to bet on uncertain pursuits.
 If new businesses rise where new risks are being undertaken, then those
 with old wealth must take more risk.
 As we make no attempts to model the processes of creative destruction that
 create new goods and services affecting income of others, we assume that
 those with old wealth have full information of the new wealth opportunities
 (full information market) and therefore therefore new wealth doesn't replace
 the old wealth interchangably in the model through risk investments.
 The only competition that exists in this model economy is between the risk-seek
ing individuals and risk-averse individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investments of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 are therefore risky in the stochastic model.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 may separate the consumer's perception of risk from the uncertainty she
 perceives about her wealth.
 To this end, we first explain a discrete model before providing an outline
 of how an extension into the continuous model can be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer utility under risk is different from the utility derived without
 risk (see Shoemaker).
 If a consumer is allowed to have an irrational expectation of closing the
 wealth gap, then the previous utility model can only indicate that a consumer
 with lower wealth would get the same overall utility as consumer with higher
 wealth if their consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is sligthly dissimilar.
 This does not allow us the risk-seeking consumer from a risk-averse consumer
 by the shape of the utility function.
 As in the case without uncertainty, we contract an approaches where a consumer
 optimises only the wealth with one where both 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 utility from consumption as well.
 There is something peculiar about the simple dynamics of equation - it

 This is meant to represent a particular situation of uncertainty in assets
 growth where i) assets decline only through consumption (risk) and ii)

From the point of the model we seek for status consumption, are two reasons
 why such a utility function is desirable - first, it represents the property
 of loss-aversion in ownership of long-term assets (i.e.
 the consumer dislikes losses more than she likes profits ).
 Second, it repreesnts the non-linear effect of probability.
 A risk-averse individual would see the same opportunity differently from
 a risk-seeking individuals and a risk-neutral individual would simply observer
 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)=p$

Reinterpreting Income Arrangement for the stochastic case: 
\series default
The need for income arrangment is seems more of a protection against adverse
 conditions.
 a redistribution could be justified if through a stroke of luck, the consumer
 1 becomes much richer than consumer 2 (event 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 This could happen even if the consumers 1 and 2 had started with the same
 wealth i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Unlike in the non-stochastic case, however, the two consumers would choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 based not only on the basis of the actual uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 but also their own degree of risk-aversion ( 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 ).
 In other words, if they're risk averse their asset would eventually decline
 (relative to the richer consumer).
 Since we consider refernce points based on the two wealth of both the consumers
, it's not enough that the consumer has enough income to sustain herself,
 she would also want to avoid losing out to the other consumer.
 This is what justifies the income arrangment in the stochastic case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus neither consumer observes any utility by moving away from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

(the Pareto condition might not be met).
 To decide on the particular form of utility, we may treat 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 as the indication of probability.
 A more risk-averse consumer is likely to choose a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 Notice also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is bounded by income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta A$
\end_inset

.
 If a common 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 exists - i.e.
 if all the consumers face an environment where taking more risk uniform
 increases the chances of increasing wealth uniformly, a lower income would
 force the consumer to be risk-averse.
 We need to determine 
\series bold
the behaviour of a risk-neutral consumer in the model.
 This is the only thing that would make sense from a status consumption
 POV.
 
\series default
The consumer might decided to take more risk if she believes her chances
 are fairer than they may be.
 The utility is actually a combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the probability of it being stable - inverse variance.
 If the consumer faces a choice which would minimise the variance of her

The more creative or lucky individual might even pass on more wealth to

\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<<A_{2}$

 The consumer

 might decide to exchange her different services where she takes very little
 risk and just gets an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(A_{2}-A_{1})$

 The income to redistributed can still be seen as a proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

\begin_inset Formula $(A_{2}-A_{1})$
\end_inset

 because the income arrangement would be non-existent if the two individuals
 had the same level of assets.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
The equilibria would be sought with a stochastic term as well.
 The risk-taking is therefore shared.
 This helps us refine how redistribution policies such as taxation might
 allow the (separating?) equilibrium for risk-seeking and risk-averse individual
s to exist by letting a risk.
 This is relevant for status consumption because the risk-sharing would
 imply that status consumption is not necessarily important when the class
 differences are strong.
 This is the refinement offered by other works as well.

Continuous Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bernoulli trials provide us a general framework for elucidation of a PT-based
 risk-sharing equilibrium but a model based on continuous distributions
 may be promising in their own right.
 As in the discrete case, when there are two players, the two may have the
 same assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 but a different appetite for risk.
 The need for the income arrangement may still be needed to prevent an infinite
 gap between 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}>>A_{1}$
\end_inset

we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
dA_{1}=\delta(A_{2}-A_{1})dt-\psi_{1}dt+\sigma(\psi_{1})dW_{1}\\
dA_{2}=-\delta(A_{2}-A_{1})dt-\psi_{2}dt+\sigma(\psi_{2})dW_{2}
\end{gather*}

If 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0$

 For

The arithmetic Brownian is highlighted only to show how critical the selection
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 is for the case when a normal distribution of wealth changes is assumed.
 We have briefly touched upon the choice of distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 before.
 In the real-world, the choice of the distribution would depend on the nature
 of economy.
 Appropriate judgment would need to be made for a given data.
 All else being the same, in any growing economy, inheritable wealth would
 decline in value when it's not invested.
 In a declining economy, wealth would depreciate slower and keep the relative
 advantage.
 Accumulated wealth is valued by everyone because of a certain process that
 is known to accumulate wealth for oneself - but in a in complete chaos,
 it would have no value.
 It grows only because an order is maintained and economy keeps growing.
 This could be assumed for most of the economies.
 A distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 can be sought based on this.
 In the real world, the a consumer takes multiple risks by distriuting her
 consumption across multiple commodities.
 Education might be high-risk, high-reward in a developng country but is
 fairly riskless in a developed country (except when inherent in the residential
 neighborhoods or quality of schools).
\end_layout

Let's consider briefly the dynamics of 
\begin_inset Formula $dA=-\psi Adt+\psi A\sigma dW$
\end_inset

.
 Here, the asset is not meant to grow.
 The consumer opt output by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=0$
\end_inset

 - if needs are uncertain, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would possibly decline to negative value.
 For a CRRA utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\frac{A^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and a lognormal 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)\sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$
\end_inset

 the expected utility 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(x))$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(x))=\frac{e^{\mu(1-\gamma)+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}(1-\gamma)^{2}-1}}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 (so that the certainty equivalent 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{CE}$
\end_inset

 for a consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{CE}=e^{\mu+\frac{(1-\gamma)}{2}\sigma^{2}}$
\end_inset

).
 One can optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(x))$
\end_inset

 by optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu+\frac{1-\gamma}{2}\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 For the dynamics, 
\begin_inset Formula $dA=-\psi Adt+\psi A\sigma dW\Rightarrow d(logA)=-\psi dt+\psi\sigma dW$
\end_inset

 , one can use Ito's lemma to infer 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)\sim N(-\psi-\frac{\psi^{2}\sigma^{2}}{2},\psi^{2}\sigma^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)$
\end_inset

 is optimised at an optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $-\psi-\frac{\psi^{2}\sigma^{2}}{2}+\frac{(1-\gamma)}{2}\psi^{2}\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 First order condition leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(1+\frac{\gamma\psi\sigma^{2}}{2})=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=0$
\end_inset

.
 This could be verified with a Monte Carlo simulation as well.

 Every transition 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{ij}=A_{i}-A_{j}$
\end_inset

 consists of a time component and a random component.
 Assuming that a consumer is only looking to optimise the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0T}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 at a time horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $W_{T}$
\end_inset

(i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{T}-W_{0}$
\end_inset

 being normally distributed with variance

\end_inset

.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 and a continuous probability weighting function 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

, a consumer would select 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (and therefore the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $p,\Delta$
\end_inset

 - which would correspond to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

) such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(p,\Delta)=\int_{p,\Delta}w(p)\nu(\Delta)dpd\Delta$
\end_inset

 is maximised.
 The value function is as defined before i.e.
\end_layout

 The probability weighting function can take forms other than the Karmakar
 function we have used - a prelec function 
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)=e^{-\beta(-ln\ p)^{\alpha}}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>0,\beta>0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $w(p)=\frac{p^{\tau}}{(p^{\tau}+(1-p)^{\tau})^{\frac{1}{\tau}}}$

\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\ge0,\delta\ge0$
\end_inset

) are some other choices.
 The stochastic environment that is imaginary and rewards the consumer based
 on a constant volatility (which is unrealistic) - so we don't wish to get
 more precise with these functions - we only consider them so that a non-linear
 probability can justified.
 Only an actual game can tell us if this gives us a more accurate view of
 the probability function.

Separating the income process from the perception of wealth also helps us
 understand the differences in consumer demand for status consumption in
 two populations that are distant in terms of a macroeconomic variable or
 a supply characteristic (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy).
 More particularly, if we may set 
\shape italic
a priori
\shape default
 inputs to the uncertainty in income growth (i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability), we could separate the effects of supply issues from the demand
 for status in the respective economies.
 When comparing a developed economy with a developing economy, for example,
 the strength of welfare institutions is of a particular significance.
 In the developed economy, on one hand, the state institutions intervene
 when market forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertaki
ngs or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distributio
n of public goods.
 When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 The uncertainty in observed probability can capture this difference as
 we compare developed economy with a developing economy and help separate
 the consumer demand from the disparate economic conditions

To illustrate why the uncertainty of an income process may be important
 for measures of status consumption, consider the status imparted through
 education - whose quality may vary in a particular economy.
 As a consequence of the difference in expectation of growth, education
 may carry more status-value in the developing world than it would in the
 developed world - simply because the distribution of education (and other
 similar assets that may be public goods) is state-assisted in a developed
 country and the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny is
 lowered.
 Thus, the extent to which education may eventually matter towards status
 in the developed economy depends on how consumers set themselves apart
 in the social order based on other means of signaling status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), a consumer would
 associate higher risk with the expected growth in education (which can
 be modeled with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability in the income process).
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support in a developing country.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions thus determines the expectation of accumulation
 of public goods (such as family education level) as how much education
 may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect of the strength of
 institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets that may provide
 the expanded consumption choices to the consumer.
 The two uncertainties in the model allow us to perform such comparisons
 by parametrising the disparate conditions as the 
\shape italic

\shape default
 probability

If one chooses to ignore the modeling of a parameter for strength of welfare
 institutions altogether (due to the belief that the demand for conspicuous
 consumption eventually benefits the society as a whole as the money is
 reinvested for the benefit of the poor in exchange for their services),
 it would still be instructive to parametrise the efficacy of institutions
 that would collect the money obtained from the rich on conspicuous items
 and fund employment and other opportunities.

 More specifically, if we consider a dynamic process for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\rho,A,\nu)$

 riskier in the developing economy (than in the developed economy) thus
 requiring a higher expenditure on the quality associated by the consumer
 in the developing economy.
