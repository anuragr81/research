\begin_layout Abstract
The status motivation for consumption has generated an immense interest
 in the developed economies at a time when social mobility has been relatively
 stagnant.
 Considering the disparate environment of a developing economy where income
 inequalities are stronger and status rewards comprise of simple improvements
 in lifestyle and wealth - we view status games as those that generate positive
 externality instead of being wasteful.
 Viewing status consumption as a self-enhancement cost and status as expected
 economic rewards in the game where consumers transition through income
 bands, we comment on the effects of a rise in long-term income differences
 on status consumption.

% Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 This is particularly important since the consumer's social need for status
 items is hardly as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.
 With social needs determined by the consumer's interaction with others
 in the economy, the demand for status items necessarily depends on social
 participation and exclusion.

\begin_layout Standard
That policy must engage with a consumer’s relative income concerns has been
 argued forcefully in recent years.
 As objections are raised to the theories that ignore relative-income concerns
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), it is worth noting that relative income has been of interest to economists
 since at least as far back as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While the relevance of relative concerns has been seldom disputed, there
 is a disconnect between the descriptive theories that consider the effects
 of the immediate context of the consumer and the theories of economic growth
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KayRadicalUncertainty2020,SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We believe that an important suggestion in the context of this disconnect
 had been made first by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HarrodGrowth1958"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - in that social mobility and status may be constrained necessarily due
 to limited positions for high status.

The literature on positional consumption has - however - maintained that
 much of status competition leads to social waste (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals,FrankPond,HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 points out, “when everyone stands on tiptoe, no one sees better”.
 The view of status consumption as social waste has been relevant for studies
 on conspicuous consumption (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals,HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004,ChaiKaus2019,CharlesHurstRace"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) as well as those on subjective well-being ( see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "clark_happiness,scitovskyjoyless1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - in particular the plateauing of happiness levels in post-war years) -
 but the relationship between economic growth and status competitions remains
 less clear.
 The social waste view is challenged - for example - by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CONGLETONStatusGames1989175"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 arguing that some status games are more productive than others and could
 lead to evolution of institutional arrangements that promote “benign” status
 games - competitions that generate positive externalities.
 Status games could thus be less futile than is assumed by the positional
 consumption literature.
 On the other hand, the negative effect of relative concerns on economic
 growth has also been suggested.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KnellInequalityStatusGrowth1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

- for example - suggest that the concerns for relative standing in an environmen
t of increased inequalities could decrease growth.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 note that the consumers under environments of higher inequality are less
 likely to realise effects of wealth or social connections and more likely
 to have a belief in meritocracy instead.
 Endogenising the choice of consumers reference groups - Falk & 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 while making them compare themselves only to “similar” others.
 With the two opposing directions in the literature, the current chapter
 leans towards the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 view to find out if the rise in income-differences decreases or increases
 status consumption in the specific context of an economy with long-standing
 income inequalities.

%[Brief description of the model]
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the positive externalites from the status games in the economy of
 income inequalities, status consumption is viewed as a direct investment
 for self-improvement for the consumer.
 This aims to represent the real-world conditions where the status competitions
 are ubiquitous through everyone’s participation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,GoldmanPapsonSignWars1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) but are constrained by real wealth due to the high status being ultimately
 driven by economic gains and enjoyed by a small section of society.
 Since status is observed in the immediate context of the consumer, it is
 does not seem paradoxical that status games both limit the exclusive status
 to a small section while letting all sections participate (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RuncimanRelativeDeprivationSocialJustice1966"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for a historical survey on reference groups).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The persistent inequalities in the economy grant the consumer in the model
 both a self-enhancement incentive (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "woodtaylorselfrelevantgoals1991"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and a mimetic tendency (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GarrelsMimesisAndScience2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) to emulate the rich.
 Status is viewed only as the expected accumulated wealth at a certain risk
 over the long term in a game where the consumer obtains a fixed disposable
 income by belonging to an income band (at a a given time).
 Thus while income is fixed for all consumers in the same band, the status
 competitions in every income band also provide a probabilistic transition
 to a richer income band - so that status consumption, as an investment
 for self-improvement, increases the probability of promotion (and the security
 against demotion) to a richer (poorer) band.
 The solution of the model uses the conditions of stability for a feasible
 growth of (risky) wealth under an observed probability of upwards or downwards
 transition.

Much like the view of status as a ranking device based on non-transactional
 environments that is taken by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the treatment of social goods is the same as that for the economic goals
 in the model.
 Status is achieved in the process of the consumer’s maximisation of her
 projected assets-accumulation using the incomes received from the variety
 of income strata she may belong to in the future (due to transitions through
 the income bands).
 While status consumption is the cost to participate in a tiered rewards
 game towards the universal race to exclusivity, it does not mean that status
 is the only goal which consumers pursue - only that their status is implied
 by the common expectation of the secure wealth they acquire in the game.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth reiterating that the sense of status consumption as wasteful
 consumption in excess of needs is not relevant to the above self-enhancement
 notion of status consumption.
 If status games can be assumed to generate positive externalities, then
 the distinction between a necessity and excess is unimportant - if distinguisha
ble at all - for status consumption.
 Thus buying a luxury watch or joining a club membership is not meant to
 offer an income reward to consumer in the future (or that they are bought
 for such a purpose) - but the status benefit from having a luxury watch
 or a club membership carries a meaning to the consumer only if it is associated
 with real wealth (albeit at risk) in the long-term.
 The raison d’etre of status consumption is thus comprised within a certain
 mimetic association with the rich and the promotion (or demotion) to richer
 (poorer) bands - encapsulating processes that may be social (e.g.
 by allowing the consumer to engage with richer members in club who can
 more readily afford the status good) or emotional (by instilling self-confidenc
e or improving self-esteem) but relate to the long-term mobility that maintains
 income inequalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above notion of status consumption evidently deviates from the futility
 view of conspicuous consumption (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals,HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - bearing more similarity with the rent-seeking approaches to status in
 the literature (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TullockEfficientRentSeeking2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As we have argued, neither the status games nor the investments towards
 success in them are futile when the future wealth states of the consumer
 depend on the investments made by the consumer.
 The private pleasure which the overworked clerk receives in giving or receiving
 the most expensive gifts might classify as conspicuous consumption from
 a certain perspective - but the investment sense of status consumption
 under “productive” status competitions may treat gift-exchanges as relevant
 only as long as they are associated with higher-income groups and bring
 real gains to the consumer.
 The consumer utility is achieved not directly through the references either
 (as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004,OxobyCognitiveDissonanceStatus2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) but through states that are driven by the reference - a treatment that
 is similar to the approach followed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It is worth emphasising that no variation in traits is assumed for the
 consumers (as is assumed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - since status is realised only through performance in the status competitions
 pertaining to each income-band.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As consumers move up or down the hierarchy of income bands with a certain
 probability, the key condition for the long-term stability comes from the
 stability of sub-populations within these bands.
 The other important condition we utilise is that the status competitions
 must stay lucrative for participants in all income-bands in the long-term.
 Simply put, the latter condition implies that the rich consumer must not
 feel that there is too little price for which the poorer consumer is offered
 a chance to be rich while the poorer consumer must not feel that there
 is nothing on offer for mobility through status competitions to the richer
 position.
 In a simplified consideration of two income- bands, we discuss the implications
 of the above two conditions on the equilibrium and a feasible probability
 of transition.
 With status consumption as the cost of participation in status competitions,
 we then discuss how a consumer may balance accumulating wealth at risk
 while maintaining a fair chance to improve or maintain her social position.

\begin_layout Standard
One of the implications of the two long-term equilibrium conditions - i.e.
 band population stability and appeal of status competitions across all
 bands - is that status consumption for the poorer consumer need not decline
 with narrowing of income differences.
 Equivalently, the costs to maintain the high wealth for the richer consumer
 may rise with narrowing of income differences in the long-term.
 As such, while wider income differences intensify status competitions and
 increase status consumption in the short-term, the long-term equilibrium
 conditions of population stability and universal appeal of status competitions
 imply a different dynamics so that the wider income differences act to
 reduce status consumption by making band-promotion more difficult (for
 the poor consumers) and band-security cheaper (for the richer consumers).
 Similarly, it is also ensured that a narrowing of income-differences in
 the long-term increases the value of (utility from) the status consumption
 for poorer consumers - so that the poorer consumers spend less on status
 investments while the richer consumers raise their status consumption to
 maintain their position of wealth.

Contrasting our non-futility view against the idea of conspicuous consumption
 due to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we find that Veblen’s observations on “exploits” - as a tendency rooted
 in hunter-gatherer societies - could carry a significance wider than the
 sense of wastefulness that is interpreted in much of the literature on
 positional consumption.
 Rather than being wasteful, the symbolism inherent in the status goods
 is mimetic - not only because it makes every participant wastefully mimic
 the behaviour of the rich but also because this mimetic behaviour may result
 in prosperity.
 This motivates subjecting the mimesis to the constraints of stratification
 and of the stability of population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, while a certain mobility through status competitions may provide
 stability and a perception of fairness in an economy where processes of
 accumulation and inheritance would otherwise expand wealth differences,
 the conditions for long-term stability reverse the implications widening
 of income differences in the short-term.
 These conditions and the implications are detailed in the following sections.

The view for status commonly used in the positional literature is that of
 a non-necessary or conspicuous consumption that has no utility in the private
 sense (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals,FrankModel"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While status has been viewed in a dynamic contexts (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KonradStrategyDynamicsContests"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and using network approaches (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ImmorlicaSocialStatusNetworks2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the utility from status consumption is more often assumed to be through
 its signaling value.
 That there may be a positive externality from success in the status competition
s has been considered less often in the literature.
 The current chapter takes this less-travelled route in the context of a
 developing economy while relying on the argument (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CONGLETONStatusGames1989175"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) that status-assigning systems may be less wasteful than suggested by the
 futility view of status consumption (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankModel,FrankPond,HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Using a contest-theory approach to track the externalities from success
 in status games with a probability transition function, our approach bears
 similarity with the rent-seeking competitions that were first presented
 by

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"

\end_inset

 is a full information game.
 However, we are more concerned with the implications of the long-term equilibri
um than the sequential setting that is at the heart of a Tullock contest.
 Instead of operating as Tullock's bidding competition, the model uses a
 logistic probability function for transition across income bands that is
 constrained by population stability of income bands and the appeal for
 status competitions across each band.
 The probability function used in the model is thus different form that
 in the Tullock contest - which has a unique probability function necessitated
 by its setting (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kooremanTullockProbability1997"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for a theoretical discussion of the uniqueness).
 Since the number of players is fixed in the long-term equilibrium due to
 the population stability condition, the issue of multiple players does
 not arise in our simultaneous formulation either.
 In contrast with the discussions of the short-term (symmetric) Nash equilibria
 for Tullock rent-seeking games with a discrete strategy(see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BayeKovenockTullockCompetition_r_gt_2_1994,BayeKovenockAllpayAuction1996"

), our focus is on the feasibility of transition probability functions under
 an equilibrium where no participating consumers see any net benefit in
 the long-term from changing her level of status consumption.

The conditions on the feasibility of transition probability also address
 the issue of dissipation - the total invested resources in the rent-seeking

 While status is constituted not in the supposed qualities of a

 but through the consumer goals of asset evolution under risk, we don't
 argue that a consumer goes into the market to acquire status goods for
 the purpose of achieving social position.
 Instead, it is argued only that status is constituted in the total of what
 consumer acquires and signals in the society in the long-term rather than
 as a goal in itself.
 It is important to avoid the category error that is committed by equating
 the behaviour of the long-term aggregate with that of the individual without
 taking into account that status is implied by various micro-goals over
 time.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model for status in a context of inequalities and a transition among
 income bands entails a balance between i) the consumers in the higher income
 band who are favoured in the game while also incurring the cost of keeping
 the status competitions feasible and ii) the poorer consumers for whom
 the promise of a reward must stay lucrative enough.
 To investigate if the income differences increase status consumption for
 the consumers in this setting or not, we examine how wider income differences
 between bands could diminish the hope for mobility and the narrower differences
 could reduce the appeal for status competitions.
 As we detail in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the feasible status game that arises from the constraints is one that
 is neither too egalitarian (to avoid the richer consumer from withdrawing
 her participation) nor too cut-throat (to avoid the poorer consumer from
 giving up on the hope for mobility through the competition) - thus letting
 the status competitions prevail for the stable income-bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the proposed model is to look at how the demand for status consumpti
on - viewed as investment towards promotion of wealth - changes under an
 environment of disparate clusters of disposable income.
 The consumer's belonging to these distinct bands implies different disposable
 incomes for the consumer.
 This is equivalent to the more commonly used assumption of wealth growing
 at a constant growth rate - where a similar clustering of assets would
 imply an immense variation in interest income across bands.
 The separation of consumers among income bands is meant to provide a disposable
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in a given period to the consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 The choice which the consumer faces then is to either i) save for a gain
 the utility from assets while staying in her current income band or ii)
 spend a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 out of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 while staying in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to participate in a status competition that would promote her to a higher
 income band in a certain probability depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 We assume no credit line towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 so that a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 with status consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{k}$
\end_inset

 always has 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{k}\le y_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the income bands range from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in an economy so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}<y_{k+1}\forall k\in[1,n-1]$
\end_inset

, we associate a probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 with the promotion of a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to the next income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is not defined for the highest band 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer could also be demoted to an immediate lower income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the lowest band 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected utility from the future assets in the respective
 income bands she may be in the future.
 The incomes are distinguished based solely upon rewards of status competitions
 i.e.
 the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1...n}$
\end_inset

 that are provided in the respective income band (the disposable income
 excludes the cost of a consumer's needs and is the same for all consumers
 in a particular asset-band).
 We summarise the assumption as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:def_band"

\end_inset

The incomes bands are characterised only by the levels of disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final goal of every consumer in the model is to have the highest assets
 in the economy.
 Since the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every band can be used to accumulate towards assets under risk of loss
 or participate in tournaments of unobserved ability, the wealth differences
 among consumers in this economy arise only due to their performance in
 status competitions.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the status competitions are meant to arise due to institutional arrangements
 that grant some mobility across income bands while not completely getting
 rid of the stratification that prevents more participation.
 In other words, the success in status competitions serves both as an evidence
 of ability and as a barrier to entry for those with less proven abilities.
 The ability pertinent to one's status may be innate, unobserved and responsible
 for success in the status competitions, but it is relevant only through
 probabilistic monetary success in the long-term and is revealed to the
 consumer only through status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The competition is biased in favour of the high spender, so that more status
 consumption increases the probability of one's successes in the status
 competitions through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and decreases that of failure 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is defined so that a consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is rewarded more often and so that no amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can ever provide guarantee to be in the next band (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 are assumed to have the same structure across income bands.
 A lower band (e.g.
 a poorer underlcass in an economy or a poorer country in the global economy)
 may thus have a lower base-level status consumption (e.g.
 mean) but the outperformers in a poor environment are expected to improve
 their fortunes through the same mechanism that a consumer in a higher-income
 band would.
 This is a fundamental assumption for the status competitions in the model
 that determines the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$

\end_inset

, the consumers of varying characteristics (age, skills, talent etc.) observe
 the same likelihood of promotion to the next band as long as they are in
 the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 - so that 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 offer exactly the same probability to all the consumers in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Further, since the status competitions in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 to be promoted to band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are not open to any consumers in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that is lower than the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

, it follows that for a consumer to be in a band higher than the next she
 must go through the next band.
 We thus state the following implication of the above assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

A consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can reach to another band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 only by going through bands 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1,...,j-1$

\begin_layout Standard
The Corollary 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cor:sequential_rise"

 implies a Markovian property for the consumer's future utility from assets.
 Status is the expected future utility at any point that the consumers optimise
 with the income received in their income band by either staying in the
 same band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or having moved to any of the bands different from their own.
 This scheme of transitions implied by this property in an economy of 
\begin_inset Formula $1...n$
\end_inset

 bands is shown in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have highlighted before, the only goal of the consumer is to maximise
 her final assets and the disposable income differences don't directly influence
 her choice except through the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 that she puts up in hope for staying in the higher band.
 Since higher income implies higher assets, the presence of mobility as
 well as some status consumption (depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is necessary for her to get to the next band.

\begin_layout Standard
The above set up for status competitions implies a short-term Nash equilibrium
 as consumers optimise the total accumulated assets in their band-reference
 within a given (finite) period of time.
 While the assets to be optimised are meant to be at risk in the long-term,
 the short-term optimisation is unaware of the assets being at risk in the
 short-term finite horizon.
 For the discussion of the short-term equilibrium, we use an economy of
 two bands represented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Without loss of generality, we consider the equilibrium when the consumers
 in the economy comprising of a poor band 1 and a rich band 2 optimise the
 assets accumulated in a single (finite) period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice first that the consumer in the two-band economy can either be demoted
 or promoted over time and her expected future wealth would be the expected
 sum of incomes from the future bands she can be in over the finite time-horizon.
 In the Markov chain implied in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the future state of the consumer is thus based on either of the future
 bands she could be in with the respective probabilities associated with
 the transition i.e.
 the consumer in band 1 could expect to have either 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 income in the next period with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $1-W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 In the period after next, she could be in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}$

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and so in further periods.
 Similarly, the consumer in band 2 could be in band 1 or 2 in the next period
 with the respective probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and so on.

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the optimisation of expected utility over a (finite) single-period,
 the representative consumer in the two-bands economy has - as it were -
 just one life and the one-shot-investment for her life-time status as she
 maximises the utility from assets under no risk.
 The probability functions associated with the promotion and demotion 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 respectively are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In the short-term finite horizon equilibrium, the representative consumer
 must optimise the savings at the end of the first-time horizon.
 It being a finite time-horizon, the consumer is not expected to spend on
 status consumption at the end of her life.
 Thus, as is common in the applications of the life-cycle model (see Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the finite-time horizon optimisation means that the consumer isn't concerned
 with the life after the time-horizon.
 In other words, the short-term equilibrium requires that the consumer does
 not worry about her poorer or richer future state expect for the final
 assets at the end of time finite time-horizon.
 We thus set the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the last period as zero for all the consumers regardless of the value
 of assets they have amassed.

 A change 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y\equiv y_{2}-y_{1}$

 Therefore the past success in status competitions is the only relevant

For the purposes of our discussion on long-term conditions, we continue

\begin_layout Standard
A condition for long-term stability that we impose is that of the stability
 of income band populations.
 More specifically, the number of consumers who leave an income band in
 the long-run must be balanced by those entering the income band in the
 long-term.
 An equilibrium with long-term income inequalities cannot exist if not for
 such a population preserving status competition.
 The long-term status competitions with a population preserving mechanism
 - are equivalent to a scheme where an equal number of consumers are selected
 in successive bands and swapped with each other at a certain cost (see
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:WinnersandlosersChainExchange"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 With such a swapping mechanism, if 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 represents the probability of a consumer moving from band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 (not defined for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=n$

It is worth emphasising that the long-term income inequalities without any
 redistribution (or a status competition defined as above) cannot provide
 a stable long-term equilibrium for asset values.
 More specifically, if we rule out any institutions of direct redistribution
 of income, the accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=\sum_{t}^{T}\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the disposable income for the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}=y_{i}\forall t$
\end_inset

 ) - would lead to unstable differences in accumulated wealth - unless there
 is a risk of loss associated with the accumulation of wealth so that accumulati
ons remain finite.
 While it may seem plausible that an equilibrium of assets under no risk
 but with different disposable incomes may arrive as long as the consumers
 can move across bands often enough through status competitions, it can
 be shown that no redistribution or status competition can allow for a long-term
 equilibrium of asset values in the above economy with unequal incomes (see
 Appendix II).
 Thus while it may appear that the assets would be redistributed towards
 stability if they are carried over every consumer with the swap and if
 the consumers are selected randomly enough to be swapped, the status competitio
ns may actually never be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the exchange to provide long-term equilibrium of assets accumulated
 under no risk.
 No matter how less the consumers care less about being shunned into lowest
 bands due the security ensured by a redistribution, the absence of risk
 in accumulation of wealth prevents stability of asset values - except when
 there are no gains at from status consumption in the long-run for either
 of the consumers (thus requiring the richer band consumer to spend proportionat
ely higher on status competitions).
 With assets under risk, on the other hand,

%A Pareto equilibrium for the consumers in this simplified chain would consider
 choices of  and  in bands  and   that result in the optimal accumulations

 On the other hand, the Nash equilibrium for a consumer in a band would
 have her choose an optimal nu for a given mechanism of selecting winners
 and losers and the given choice of nu that all other consumers have made.

 This is illustrated with a simple formulation of an independent stochastic

 being observed by both the consumers independently implies that the above
 set up also allows us to ignore the role of starting assets consider 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 for both the consumers in the long-term.
 The consumer accumulations are expected to be reset at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=T$
\end_inset

 and the consumer thus minimises her accumulation at the time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 However, given that assets are to be maximised in the longer-term, the
 consumer must also strike a balance between i) taking a fair chance to
 be in the richer band and ii) accumulating as high assets as possible towards

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above long-term conditions imply that a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 makes the loss to a lower band more acceptable for the consumer in band
 2.
 Peer effects kick due to the fact that the richer consumer absorbs (replicates)
 the choice made by poorer consumers as she is demoted to band 1 and thus
 the choice of the poorer band is also factored into her choice in the starting
 period.
 Similarly, a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 might make staying in the poorer band more appealing for the consumer 1.
 With asset accumulations under risk, the competitions therefore do allow
 the consumers to share their risky assets in the long-term.

\begin_layout Standard
If the total assets acquired by the consumer may be considered the only
 notion of welfare in the economy, the above model also allows us to evaluate

% Discontinuity: Before reset the the consumer accumulates and after the
 reset her asset disappears.
 The combined utility is maximised the final expected assets and the consumer
 cannot maximise at t=1 without considering what happens after (e.g.
 another consumer comes, L,W change etc.).
 Further, since the choice at t=1 is different from choice at t=0 if considering
 the next period alone, a single nu for two time periods can only be forced.
  The total assets which we consider are different in the current assets
 where the decision is being made.
 The same asset can be enjoyed more in the poorer band and that matters
 only when utilities are considered i.e.
 after summing them up over time.

% Discarding intertemporal substitution - The solution with intertemporal
 utility has the advantage that it provides a control for whether consumers
 care more about the long-term transition or the the accumulation.
 Long-term movements are not influenced by savings at all (all savings are

 This also allows us to

 high

 Again magnitude of

 whether the consumer below a certain threshold get no benefit at all.
 We do however see curvature effect on

 lambda_bar also adds curvature to consumer 1 i.e.

We now use the above equilibrium condition to explain the effects of income
 difference

 on status competitions.
 Since

\end_inset

 are now endogenised within the equilibrium conditions, we can address the
 issue that income changes would change the competitions.
 Unlike with the short-term equilibrium, the changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 correspond to a different 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$

 The costs imposed by assets are not fully captured in the reported asset-costs

 For the for fitting purposes itself, estimating a function that considers
 the number cars and houses owned would have be better - but that isn't
 what we're concerned with.
 For this reasons, the asset-cost function shape must not be relied on.
 Instead how a given fitted value of cost-function would impact the net

 We are interested only in the condition in Equation  being satisfied -

% HK: a more affluent society will have lower utility at each income level.
 Hence, an increase in average income may be consistent with a decrease
 in social welfare.
 More plausibly, social welfare may rise only slowly in response to economic
 growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% HK: poor are made worse off by greater equality.
 Such an increase in equality will also increase conspicuous  waste by those
 on middle incomes or low and middle incomes, while conspicuous consumption
 by the rich may decrease (our finding too).
 consequently, when we consider corrective taxes on conspicuous consumption,
 we find that the more equally income is distributed, the higher taxes and
 subsidies should be for those with low to middle incomes, and the lower
 they should be  or those with high incomes.
 Indeed, we are able to show that in some circumstances a corrective policy
 with higher tax rates (but also higher subsidies) for those with low incomes
 can lead to a Pareto improvement

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That a population stability must prevail in a long-term equilibrium of income
 bands leads to two key implications for status consumption under income
 inequalities that we explain using the proposed model.
 First, a segregation of demand is possible for status consumption under
 inequalities when either the poorer consumer sees no benefits from participatin
g in status competitions or the rich person might finds too little security
 on offer from status consumption.
 Second, the long-term equilibrium conditions imposed by population stability
 of bands implies that status consumption for the poorer (richer) consumer
 need not fall (rise) with fall in income differences.
 While it is tempting to argue using the short-term equilibrium conditions
 that wider income differences make status competitions more stringent and
 status consumption higher (lower) for the poorer (richer) consumer, the
 long-term equilibrium - under conditions of population stability and broad
 appeal for status competitions - imply a different dynamics where wide
 income differences reduce status consumption by making promotion difficult
 (for the poor consumers) or security cheaper (for the richer consumers).

%Unlike the Hopkins-Korenienko[#HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004] (HK) approach,
 we consider social welfare only in terms of the pareto optimality of expected
 future assets.
 While this prevents us from differentiating between social welfare and
 economic growth for the consumer, it pursues the specific goal of understanding
 the effect of near-permanent extreme income differences on status consumption.
 Similar to the findings from the HK approach, however, we also find that
 status consumption - viewed as wasteful from a social welfare perspective
 - could increase for the poorer consumer with an increase in equality (i.e.
 narrower income differences).

The arguments for the accumulation of assets under known risks being the
 only goal of the representative consumer may also assist in empirical applicati

 from education - cannot be ruled out.

 consumption across the distribution of long-term assets amidst wider socio-econ

% [Next: greed and loss-aversion] When consumers have a preference for lower

 can shift the equilibrium further.
 Contentment is just the name of loss-aversion associated.
 Consumers might be less loss-averse with respect to A_{0} in which case
 they are more content with lower than A_{0}.
 On the other hand, they might be in a regime where consumers don't like
 being less than A_{0} at all.
 We look at the contentment vs aspiration in the above setup for a given

 The consumer utility uses a reference function defined around long-term
 A_{0} so that there are two regimes.
 First, where being poor may not become successively bad.
 Second, is the regime where contentment is valuable and the consumer below
 A_{0} don't mind it too much compared to how much consumers with more wealth...
 .
 The other regime is when consumer are more greedy and people mind being
 poor a lot compared to being rich.
 We see how either of these regimes are influenced by 
\backslash
kappa vs y_{2}-y_{1}(This way we don't need to deal with measurement of

 that may lead to stable asset-values in an economy with different income
 bands uses a general cost-function associated with the level of assets
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 This function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(A)$
\end_inset

 is used to explain how consumers in the long-term equilibrium may balance
 future expected income with the costs imposed by the current assets.
 In empirical terms, this may correspond to expected expenditure required
 to maintain a certain level of wealth - including any maintenance fees,
 interest on loan, club memberships etc.
 that are associated with a certain level of wealth.
 We also define a net asset value function based on the general cost-function
 
\begin_inset Formula $c(A)$
\end_inset

 that represents the net value of assets after adjusting for asset-costs

Note that even if the consumer were allowed to use leverage (credit) by

\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}<\nu_{2}$

 We now state the proof that no

 stability conditions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The proof is stated for two bands and can be generalised for higher number

 Notice that the population-stability constraint for the two band-economy

\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The above condition implies that the consumer balances her expected future
 income with the costs on her assets.
 The net asset value from being either in band 1 or band 2 would be balanced
 by the expected returns the consumer 1 gets from putting up 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 towards status consumption.
 Since the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 must be positive and less than unity, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{2})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 must be less than zero.
 In other words, the consumer in band 1 must move from a negative net asset-valu
e to a positive asset value in band 2 (or vice versa).
 Similarly, for the consumer in band 2, the following quantity must amount
 to zero in the long-term equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{2}(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2})\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})+(1-L_{2}(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}))\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2}) & \rightarrow0

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
L(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}) & =\frac{1}{1-\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2})}}\label{eq:l_lte}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Above ensures that the expected loss from being in band 1 is balanced by
 the security provided by 
\begin_inset Formula $1-L_{2}(\nu_{2})$

.
 For consumer 2, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2})}$

 must also be less than zero when she moves from a negative net asset value
 in band 2 to a positive net asset-value in 1 (or vice versa).

\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
As long as status competition is feasible for consumer 1, she should see
 an increase in the long-term net asset value by being in band 2.
 The possibility of moving from band 1 to band 2 only to observe the net
 asset value decline is ruled out because higher income bands are also meant
 to have a higher asset reference.
 Any peer effects associated with the assets (or a higher reference level
 for assets) would ensure a higher asset reference in the higher asset-band.
 Thus while the consumer in band 1 cannot afford to have a decline in net
 asset value if she moves to the next band, the consumer in the rich band
 might accept a poorer band with a net increase in asset value.
 This implies that the the net asset-value function must be concave (see
