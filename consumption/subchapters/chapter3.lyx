\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the predominant view of status in empirical economics remains one
 that is based on hierarchy of ranks (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goldthorpeOccupationalGrading1975,wegener1992prestigeconcepts,goldthorpesociology2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), several attempts have been made in both sociology and economics to view
 status in a more dynamic framework (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "webereconomysociety1925,wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Instead of treating status goals separate from economic goals, the presented
 chapter pins down a specific link between economics and social goals relevant
 for status consumption by allowing an indirect (instrumental) effect of
 status on consumer wealth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contrast between economic and social goals has received much attention
 in the the sociological literature where several attempts have been made
 to reconcile the subjective aspects of status (the effect of status differences
 on individual behaviour) and its objective aspects (the observed reality
 of status differences).
 A certain dynamism to address the issue has been experimented either within
 an order of hierarchy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007,parsonssystemsocieties1971"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) or as a conflict among social aggregates (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "webereconomysociety1925"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The current chapter banks a view of status provided by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 wherein status is necessarily shaped by the institutional nurturing or
 discouragement of certain attributes.
 Given the wide-differences in the level of development that is often observed
 among developing economies (such as Tanzania and Nigeria), the current
 chapter investigates how expenditure towards status could change with rising
 income differences in an environment where both social capital and raw-skills
 have a role to play in the individual's status-influenced economic success.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the typical attribution of status to exogenous factors such as race
 or caste, the chapter attempts to explain how variation in urban institutions
 influence expenditures such as education that contribute to income mobility
 while also carrying some status value.
 The explanations follow the Weberian framework that contrasts 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{Geschellschaft}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{Gemeinschaft}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and has been widely used in both sociology and economics (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "webereconomysociety1925,goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The endogenisation of status i.e.
 its explanation in economic terms - as well as the parametrisation of urbanisat
ion is meant to help with the theoretical arguments for how expenditures
 towards status in economies may change as the access to institutions such
 as secondary or tertiary education and income differences change over time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structural basis for the relation between economic and social goals
 rests upon arguments from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that an economy for status ought to be considered separate from one where
 the consumer utility is maximised.
 As also argued by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 , the degree of uncertainty is often an important motivation for the signaling
 in the context of conspicuous consumption.
 The current chapter thus views status competitions as a probabilistic game
 where individuals compete with both raw-talent and acquired-skills (social
 capital) to get promoted from a poor to rich position.
 The winner of the game is promoted to a rich position (or maintains her
 rich position) by having the maximum total score comprising both of raw-talent
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (uniformly distributed in a population) and social capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (enhanced with expenditure).
 The social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 that is enhanced through expenditure is also subject to budget constraints
 imposed on the consumer
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We do not view leisure as separate from budget constraints in the model.
 In other words, the leisure relevant for higher stauts is interpreted simply
 as a higher cost for the poorer participant.
 So long as once can view leisure as the amount of money a participant must
 forgo in order to participate in status competition, the leisure differences
 can be also viewed as differences in disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this tournament view of status, the only two types of participants are
 the poor and rich classes so that investments towards status (such as club-memb
ership fees, or higher-education) increase the chances to be promoted.
 Those who don't participate in the tournament certainly suffer with being
 poor, but those who do spend only benefit probabilistically.
 A useful analogy to explain such tournaments are tennis championships -
 where rewards are risky but are not like lotteries where more expenditure
 may linearly increase one's chance to win.
 As with the game of tennis, participants with appropriate raw-talent and
 skills may exist naturally in a population.
 While there exist certain biological characteristics such as strength,
 dexterity, height or psychological abilities (resilience, conscientiousness
 etc.) that help one's tennis, there also exist several characteristics such
 as technique, rankings, knowledge of conventions, racket-customisations
 that are only available at a significant cost to the participant.
 The enhancement of these latter skills (social capital) are what the institutio
nal support discussed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are meant to represent.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues, the characteristics of such status games are often made to reward
 curated abilities rather than naturally occurring raw-strengths.
 A significant number of participants may thus never realise their true
 potential unless they spend enough to hone their skills.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a simple model of uncertainty, the probability to win depends on the
 combined weighted distribution of raw-talent and enhanced-skills.
 Thus a winner of the game is the participant who has the highest combined
 score consisting of raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (the latter enhanced with expenditure).
 To arrive the long-term equilibrium condition, we also assume that the
 participants keep the population constant over time and therefore the number
 of rich positions in the population remain fixed in the long-term.
 The rich participants are thus replaced by either a rich or poor participant
 only through a tournament that selects the participant with the highest
 combined score - regardless of their rich or poor background.
 All participants participate in every such tournament so it is possible
 for a rich participant to lose her rich-position and let another participant
 acquire her position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preferences for all poor participants are the same as are the preferences
 of all the rich participants.
 Having a rich or a poor status by itself only has an indirect effect (through
 higher expenditure or budget) on the chance to be promoted (or maintaining
 one's rich position) - a probability that otherwise depends on the privately
 known ability 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 All rich participants and all poor participants having the same behaviour
 also means that the privately known attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are not used by the participant to decide upon the expenditure (effort)
 towards the status game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the rich and poor participants have disparate incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

), then the above setup evidently puts the poor participants at a disadvantage
 since they may not afford to pay the costs to enhance their skills (i.e.
 realise the true worth of their skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 due to high participation costs).
 However, since both raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 potentially enhanced by costly institutional support are randomly distributed
 in the population, the competition may never rule out the chance for a
 poor participant to win.
 For the same reason, the returns from investments to enhance one's skills
 may also be diminishing since one cannot beat raw-talent and non enhanced-skill
s after a certain point.
 Considering the weight of raw-talent in the total score as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 we derive long-term equilibrium conditions with a winning probability of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 being the maximum score among participants in a tournament (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to highlight that above status competitions are not meant
 to be population-wide tournaments that involve all participants of a society.
 Instead, the competitions are small-scale with varied locally defined criteria
 that may have multiple stages.
 All such competitions are meant to be independent and may vary only in
 the threshold participation cost and range of distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i},s_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the participants.
 As scope of the presented chapter is limited to the effect of income difference
s on consumption, we discuss only a particular competition with known distributi
on of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 among a relatively small number of participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, a few properties of a game follow where a wealth-optimising
 participant with a maximum score wins by enhancing her skills (social capital)
 and using her raw-talent.
 First, only one player with the maximum score can win a particular tournament.
 Second, the rank of the participant (rich / poor status) is of no direct
 significance part of her utility from wealth.
 Lastly, the privately known raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are of no significance to expenditure decisions - which vary solely on
 the basis of rich or poor status.

\begin_layout Standard
It is commonly argued status is a social rather than ab economic goal of
 the individual.
 Yet the difference between social and economic goals of the individual
 is hardly well-defined in either sociology or economics.
 The idea that status is orthogonal to economic goals - i.e.
 a

\end_inset

 view 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"

\end_inset

 - seldom fit with the real-world where status contributes to income while
 also improving with rise in income.
 Indeed the other extreme view that the economic goals alone motivate status
 competition - so that status is derived purely from economic goals is also
 unrealistic.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"

\end_inset

 argue, the reality is often somewhere in between the two extremes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A structural model for this interplay between economic and social goals
 is not however specified in either sociology or economics.
 The dominant view for status in both sociology and economics has been one
 based that is based on hierarchy and social deference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990,goldthorpesociology2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This view of status in inherent in occupational status surveys widely used
 in empirical studies (e.g.
 the EGP classes or the Goldthorpe class scheme 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goldthorpesociology2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) .
 The issue with the lack of a structural model and the specific concern
 to reconcile the difference between the objective aspects of status (the
 observed reality of status differences) and its subjective aspects (the
 effect of status differences on individual behaviour) have been more widely
 discussed in sociology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The evident issue with addressing only the objective aspect of status with
 a utilitarian model while leaving the subjective aspect exogenous is that
 status cannot be explained in economic terms when an economy for status
 is ruled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The view of status as observed order or hierarchy is hardly an all-encompasssing
 view of status in sociology.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, for example, discusses an economy of status while arguing that it is created
 as part of the economic processes.
 The structural issue of whether a certain social structure determines status
 judgments or the judgments themselves determine status may still remain
 unresolved in both sociology and economics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but several limitations with the dominant hierarchy-based view of status
 have since been remarked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foremost contention with the hierarchy-based view of status is that
 idea of social closure often gets conflated with that of hierarchy.
 The idea of social-closure (aggregate or stände first discussed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "webereconomysociety1925"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is hardly the same as social ranks that they are commonly approximated
 with in the literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The problem is not merely a theoretical issue.
 The subjective evaluations of status - which one is supposed to reconcile
 with the objective view - are observed to measure an overall desirability
 of occupations instead of status (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goldthorpeOccupationalGrading1975"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Skills or knowledge of individuals may seem to better predict the individual
 judgments of status (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "adlerstatuscomponents1985"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 More importantly, the scales of status that one employs in empirical studies
 are observed to vary significantly across the sections of society (

 , for example, argues that social institutions nurture or discourage certain
 naturally characteristics in a society.
 Thus, instead of interpreting status items as those that signal prevalent
 status norms, the dynamic view of status allows 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"

 to suggest that investments towards status may increase the likelihood
 of associating with higher-status members of society.
 A certain dynamism in social-groups - termed as conflict in the sociology
 literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

- is inherent in his view of prestige.
 While a structural model that reconciles the subjective and objective aspects
 of status are still missing from his thesis, the normative theories for
 competition among social-groups has gathered much attention in sociology

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to the same.
 The basic categories in terms of which we describe a system of hierarchies
 as a structure according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "parsonssystemsocieties1971"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is the same as those in terms of which individual behavior or performance
 is defined.
 Thus, while culture places a premium on equality, the distribution rules
 in different social subsystems is often not aimed at generating equality.
 Much like with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 while making allowances for the inequalities resulting from equality of
 opportunity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Inspired by Postlewaite, we assume that individuals have a concern for relative
 standing because their standing is instrumental in determining ultimate
 consumption levels rather than being directly contributing to their utility.

\end_inset

 use a matching-game for wealth-optimising consumers to suggest how the
 concern for relative standing need not be in the deep preferences, but
 induced in reduced form preferences with relative standing indirectly affecting
 consumption.
 The fundamental argument in following the approach is that standard economic
 markets determine much that people care about, but they might not determine
 all.
 Instead of assuming exogenously given social classes (as is often assumed
 in empirical studies relating to social classes), the approach taken by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992,postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences"

\end_inset

 assumes a certain interaction between social arrangements and economic
 behavior.
 The foremost reason for the instrumental approach is is that it allows
 us to move forward with answer status concerns as an economic problem rather
 than relying on attribute status to non-economic concerns.

It's only the first-stage of our game when the expenditure can be less than
 the total budget.
 The conditions under which the full-expenditure of the budget would take
 place can be derived much the way they were derived with the logistic probabili
ty function (SteinRapoportsymmetrictwostagecontests2005 also perform a Kuhn-Tuck
er based analysis).
 The major difference in our model is because ours is not a case of homogeneous
 players.
 The equilibrium is long-term and the consumers are in equilibrium in their
 unequal states.
 At any point of time, the competition is between the rich and the poor.
 We pair up only those with the same age.
 The results are to interpreted for every age of the consumer.
 In other words, we assume that number of consumers in every age-decile
 are stable in the equilibrium - so that there are number of poor to rich
 is not significantly different across ages.

\begin_layout Standard
While the contest for positions we use in the chapter to study effect of
 income differences does consider budget-constraints, the first-stage in
 the contest is not that of selection.
 Instead, the selection to the winner's position occurs only once in the
 two-stages of the game.
 The second-stage of the game arises only out of the finite-time horizon
 (lifetime) of the participant.
 At the end of the second-stage, all savings of the participant must disappear.
 Therefore, with zero expected assets at the end of the life-cycle, all
 expenditure in the second-stage is contributed to the indirect advantage
 through higher rank.

In the game where a participant

\begin_inset Formula $N-P$

 so that only the top-scorer gets to occupy the only rich position in every
 competition.
 The solution considers the expected behaviour of the rich and the poor
 participants in the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such there are four different cases that arise in the equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case I - The poor participant does not participate due to insufficient investmen

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0$

\begin_layout Itemize
Case II - The rich participant does not participate with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 but the poor participant does i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case III - Both poor and rich participants do not participate and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=0$

\begin_layout Itemize
Case IV - Both poor rich and participant participate with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Case I, the poor participant can win when her raw-talent (weighted
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

) is higher than that of all other poor participants as well as the total
 score of the rich participants (who compete with acquired skills).
 In this scenario, the poor are priced out of accessing any skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in their score so that only the rich participants with investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 have skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s>0$
\end_inset

 Thus, a given poor participant must be ahead both of all of the poor participan
ts and the rich participants.
 In other words, a participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can win if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is higher than than raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{k}$

With the uniform density for

 then the game depends only on raw-talents and all participants have the

 Notice also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{N}}{N}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{N}$

Effect of

\begin_layout Standard
The more

 increases the more likely is that the poor participant gets less utility
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 Higher 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 for the same 
\begin_inset Formula $P/N$
\end_inset

 has the effect that utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 has no concavity.
 More players thus make the competition uncompetitive - if all characteristics
 are uniformly distributed.
 The rich participant also faces the same effect of high 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 .
 Having more players dominates the effect of uniform characteristics and
 makes the effect of skills redundant.
 Having a two-player or a three-player game is hardly of any effect since
 large numbers significantly change the probability.
 It needs to be better explained why the game between two-players is relevant
 when being played among 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 consumers.
 One possible way to see is that competitions are not conducted over high
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and they're always conducted over few people.
 This could be clarified up-front.
 Instead of the population being replaced - we're concerned with how winners
 get a result and move on to the next-stage (which are infinite for our
 purposes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One needs to see how probability itself changes with respect to higher 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 values as a function of expenditure.
 The probability for the same expenditure ought to have a weak effect on
 probability when 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is higher.
 It may make sense therefore to stick to a 2-player model - which explains
 everything without the issues we're having with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To handle high

 Both the poor participants are priced out of accessing any skills

 The probability that the total score

 A poor participant wins by having the total score higher than the other

In Case III, when neither the rich nor the poor participate in the game,
 then the game depends only on raw-talents and all participants have the
 same probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

 to win the game.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{3}}{3}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case IV, when both rich and poor participants set

\end_inset

, then the poor participant can win only if her score 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$

 poor participant.
 Therefore,

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this integral can be evaluated based on symmetry arguments ( since
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is also randomly distributed), the integral

), the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<1/2$
\end_inset

 - indicating that curated skills are given more importance that raw-talent
 in the competitions - means that the poor participant is strictly better
 off (than facing probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

) if she participates while the rich participant doesn't participate (Case
 II).
 Also, the poor participant is better off participating for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 when the rich participant does participate as it raise the probability
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

.
 That the competition becomes uncompetitive both when threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 falls too much (letting both participants participate) or rises too much
 (letting both both participants withdraw) follows from the properties of
 the winning probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rich participant could withdraw and face either 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

 or lower probability (when the poor participant participates).
 By participating, the rich participant would either face probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

 (when poor participant also participates) or better (if the poor participant
 withdraws).
 Considering the probabilities alone, the rich participant would always
 participate.
 If the rich participant always participates, then with enough money, the
 poor participant is always better off participating as well because not
 participating would bring her probability to win below 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

.
 If the utility was from probability alone, then both participants would
 participate and face 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

 probability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Faced with a finite life-time and utility from accumulated assets, the participa
nts do not however optimise the probability to win in the game.
 Instead, the participants optimise an intertemporally additive utility

 and

\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}<y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 When the poor participant faces a binding constraint i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

 , then the rich participant knows that the best case probability to win
 for the poor participant is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

.
 The rich participant's decision to participate would depend only on utility
 from savings and the relative advantage from gain in probability.

\begin_layout Subsubsection

Binding constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming the EUT participants we first consider the simpler case of binding
 constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we assume a stability in long-term participant behaviour (which itself
 is a result of observed probability of success), mixed-strategies are not
 relevant in the current set up.
 Considering pure strategies for partcipation, the rich participant would
 thus participate only when the utility from participating would be higher
 than from not participating i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})+\frac{p_{2}u(y_{2})+(1-p_{2})u(y_{1})}{\delta}>u(y_{2})+\frac{\frac{1}{3}u(y_{2})+\frac{2}{3}u(y_{1})}{\delta}$
\end_inset

 .
 This results in the following condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{(p_{2}-1/3)(u(y_{2})-u(y_{1}))}{\delta} & >u(y_{2})-u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With income differences being the same an increase in participation cost
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 discourages participation since RHS increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\because u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})$
\end_inset

 is decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

).
 Similarly, with participation cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 being the same, an increase in income-difference 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is in the rich participant's interest to participate whereas a narrowing
 of income differences reduces incentive to participate.
 All else being the same, higher impatience (lower time-discounted value
 of money or higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

) would also discourage participation.
 Therefore, when budget is binding for the poor participant i.e.
 if the poor participant cannot participate due to 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, then narrow income differences, higher participation costs and patience
 for savings (common for both rich and poor participants) all encourage
 the rich participant to withdraw from the game.
 This also means that wider income differences (
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

) combined with lower participation costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\mu}$
\end_inset

) may together help maintain the equilibrium where only the rich participates.
 Similarly, wider income differences ( higher
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 ) and more patience for savings (higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 ) would together maintain the incentive for the rich participant to participate.
 These conclusions very much fit with the sociological observations made
 in the literature (

\end_inset

).

When budget is non-binding, then participation of the rich participant is

\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{(1/3-p_{2}')(u(y_{2})-u(y_{1}))}{\delta} & >u(y_{2})-u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})

 Thus an equilibrium with Case II which incentivises the poor to participate

We have considered a model where status amounts to a position that cements
 the participant's economic position but only temporarily.
 The dynamics of promotion and demotion depend on an economy which can only
 be partly influenced with a superior economic position.
 The results indicate that a stable is equilibrium is that of rich .
 The more equitable equilibrium could be one where both equilibrium.
 The differences in reference provide an important caveat to these results

% The main idea is to calculate the total probability over r_{i}.
 One objection that can be raised is that the total probability must be
 calculated in one big integration rather than first calculating probability
 for given r_{i},s_{i} and then letting r_{i} and s_{i} vary independently.
 But this objection can be addressed by considering the sample space of
 r_{i}.
 It seems valid to consider the conditional probability of winning by considerin
g all the possibilities for other player(s).
 As long as r_{i} , s_{i} are being varied for one participant alone, the

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $0<r<1$

\begin_layout Standard
The combination of uniform-variables provides a triangular distribution.
 Thus high combined scores - including both skills and raw-talent - are
 not uniformly distributed in the population even though raw-talent and
 skills may be distributed uniformly.
 An important result we used is that of PDF of a sum of uniformly distributed
 random variables 
\begin_inset Formula $z=ax+by$
\end_inset

 being the following convolution 
\end_layout
