 or the fully rationalist (individualist) perspective (see [#elsterrationalchoic

 Due to the limitations of data captured in a typical consumer survey that
 focus primarily on consumption and family-level characteristics, the conception

% It is worth remarking that the above view of status does not accommodate
 a social network based view of status.
 One could argue against the random distribution of attributes, given that
 many attributes are governed by parental upbringing (The literature does
 often consider a uniform distribution of skills to answer questions related
 to status-related consumption [#hopkinsWhichInequality2010].) .
 However, the above set up focuses on role of expenditure in the specific
 context of a society where

 The assumption that skills-relevant to such a competition are randomly

The predominant view of status in empirical economics has relied on a hierarchy
 of social ranks or occupations.
 While empirical studies tend to explore status concerns separately from
 economic concerns, the literature in sociology has also been concerned
 with how status perceptions relate with economic goals.
 The sociological literature has thus focussed on the issue of closure in
 social groups and attempted to reconcile the subjective and objective aspects
 of status.
 The current chapter leans towards approaches in economics that consider
 a dynamism in the hierarchical order for status.
 To provide a structural basis for the link between economic and social
 goals, the current chapter uses probability functions that determine the
 promotion and demotion of participants among rich and poor classes in an
 economy.
 The chances to win and to be promoted to the rich class in a competition
 depends on social capital - which are skills that can be enhanced with
 expenditure - as well as raw-talent which are not affected by higher expenditur
e.
 Assuming a diminishing returns to utility from wealth, the chapter then
 argues that an equilibrium with expenditure towards promotion leads to
 two primary states in the economy - one where both rich and poor strive
 for status and the other where only rich the consumers participate in status
 competitions.
 The chapter also argues that a rise in income differences incentivises
 the poor to participate in the status competition.

While the predominant view of status in empirical economics remains one
 that is based on hierarchy of ranks (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goldthorpeOccupationalGrading1975,wegener1992prestigeconcepts,goldthorpesociology2000"

\end_inset

), several attempts have been made in both sociology and economics to view
 status in a more dynamic framework (

key "webereconomysociety1925,shilsDeference1969,parsonssystemsocieties1971,ColemanSocialTheory1990,wegener1992prestigeconcepts"

\end_inset

).
 Instead of treating status goals separate from economic goals, the presented
 chapter pins down a specific link between economics and social goals relevant
 for status consumption by allowing an indirect (instrumental) effect of
 status on consumer wealth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A contrast between economic and social goals seems to have generated more
 interest in the sociological literature where the issue of reconciliation
 of the subjective aspects of status (the effect of status differences on
 individual behaviour) and its objective aspects (the observed reality of
 status differences) has gathered some attention (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The sociological literature uses both hierarchical order (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "parsonssystemsocieties1971,wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) and conflict in social aggregates (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "webereconomysociety1925,wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) to address this particular issue.
 Several approaches in economics have also incorporated the views from the
 literature that prescribe a dynamism in social order (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes,moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The current chapter relies upon views from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who view that status as a product of economic processes that is shaped
 by institutional nurturing or discouragement of individual attributes (also
 see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Given the wide-differences in the level of economic development that is
 often observed across developing economies (such as Tanzania and Nigeria),
 we find the endogenisation of status suitable for a generic framework that
 can be used to compare disparate developing economies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Focusing on the specific problem of how variation in urban institutions
 could influence expenditures such as education that carry some status value
 but also contribute to future income mobility, the proposed chapter uses
 theoretical arguments to investigate how expenditure towards status could
 change with rising income differences when both social capital and raw-skills
 have a role to play in individual's status as well as economic success.
 Unlike the typical attribution of status to exogenous factors such as race
 or caste, therefore, the approach taken in the current chapter is to view
 status under urbansiation in a commonly used Weberian framework that contrasts

 in an economy (

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The structural relation between economic and social goals is provide in
 the current approach using probability functions that define the probability
 to for a participant to be promoted to a richer status class that indirectly
 influences the consumer utility.
 This is similar to the approach suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who argue that the degree of uncertainty has an important motivation for
 the signaling in the context of conspicuous consumption.
 The presented chapter views status competitions as a probabilistic game
 where individuals compete with both raw-talent and acquired-skills (social
 capital) to get promoted from a poor to rich position.
 The winner of the game is promoted to a rich position (or maintains her
 rich position) by having the maximum total score comprising both of raw-talent
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (uniformly distributed in a population) and social capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (enhanced with expenditure).
 The social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 that is enhanced through expenditure is also subject to budget constraints
 imposed on the consumer
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We do not view leisure as separate from budget constraints in the model.
 In other words, the leisure relevant for higher stauts is interpreted simply
 as a higher cost for the poorer participant.
 So long as once can view leisure as the amount of money a participant must
 forgo in order to participate in status competition, the leisure differences
 can be also viewed as differences in disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this tournament view of status, the only two types of participants are
 the poor and rich classes so that investments towards status (such as club-memb
ership fees, or higher-education) increase the chances to be promoted to
 the rich status.
 Those who don't participate in the tournament certainly suffer with being
 poor, but those who do spend only benefit probabilistically.
 A useful analogy to explain such a competition is that of tennis championships
 - where rewards are risky but are unlike lotteries in that more expenditure
 does not linearly increase one's chance to win in a tennis championship.
 As with the game of tennis, participants with appropriate raw-talent and
 skills may exist naturally in a population but their success also depends
 on engagement with other tennis players.
 While there exist certain biological characteristics such as strength,
 dexterity, height or psychological abilities (resilience, conscientiousness
 etc.) that help one's tennis, there also exist several characteristics such
 as technique, rankings, knowledge of conventions, racket-customisations
 that are only available at a significant cost to the participant.
 The enhancement of these latter skills (social capital) are what the institutio
nal support are meant to represent.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues, the characteristics of status games are often made to reward curated
 abilities rather than naturally occurring raw-strengths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a simple model of uncertainty, the probability to win depends on the
 combined weighted distribution of raw-talent as well as skills enhanced
 by expenditure.
 A winner of the status game is the participant who has the highest combined
 score consisting of raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (the latter enhanced with expenditure).
 Considering the weight of raw-talent in the total score as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, we derive long-term equilibrium conditions with a winning probability
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 being the maximum score among participants in a tournament.
 It is also assumed that the participants keep the population constant over
 time and therefore the number of rich positions in the population remain
 fixed in the long-term.
 The rich participants are thus replaced by either a rich or poor participant
 only through a tournament that selects the participant with the highest
 combined score - regardless of their rich or poor background.
 All participants participate in every such tournament so it is possible
 for a rich participant to lose her rich-position and let another participant
 acquire her position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preferences for all poor participants are the same as are the preferences
 of all the rich participants.
 Having a rich or a poor status by itself only has an indirect effect (through
 higher expenditure or budget) on the chance to be promoted (or maintaining
 one's rich position) - a probability that otherwise depends on the privately
 known ability 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 All rich participants and all poor participants having the same behaviour
 also means that the privately known attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are not used by the participant to decide upon the expenditure (effort)
 towards the status game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the rich and poor participants have disparate incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

), then the above setup evidently puts the poor participants at a disadvantage
 since they may not afford to pay the costs to enhance their skills (i.e.
 realise the true worth of their skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 due to high participation costs).
 However, since both raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 potentially enhanced by costly institutional support are randomly distributed
 in the population, the competition may never rule out the chance for a
 poor participant to win.
 For the same reason, the returns from investments to enhance one's skills
 may also be diminishing since one cannot beat raw-talent and non enhanced-skill
s after a certain point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to highlight that above status competitions are not meant
 to be population-wide tournaments that involve all participants of a society.
 Instead, the competitions are small-scale with varied locally defined criteria
 that may have multiple stages.
 All such competitions are meant to be independent and may vary only in
 the threshold participation cost and range of distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i},s_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the participants.
 As scope of the presented chapter is limited to the effect of income difference
s on consumption, we discuss only a particular competition with known distributi
on of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 among a relatively small number of participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, a few properties of a game follow where a wealth-optimising
 participant with a maximum score wins by enhancing her skills (social capital)
 and using her raw-talent.
 First, only one player with the maximum score can win a particular tournament.
 Second, the rank of the participant (rich / poor status) is of no direct
 significance part of her utility from wealth.
 Lastly, the privately known raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are of no significance to expenditure decisions - which vary solely on
 the basis of rich or poor status.
 A closed-form solution with a diminishing utility from wealth and a threshold
 level expenditure required for participants to spend in order to avail
 social capital suggests that the only two equilibria relevant for status
 consumption are one where rich as well as poor consumer participates in
 the status competitions and one where only the rich consumer engage in
 competitions.
 On similar lines with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

It is often argued that status is a social rather than economic goal for
 an individual.
 Yet the difference between social and economic goals of the individual
 remains hardly well-defined in both sociology or economics.
 The idea that status is orthogonal to economic goals - the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pure status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 view (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) - seldom fits with the real-world observations where status both contributes
 to income and improves with rises in income.
 Indeed the other extreme view that the economic goals alone motivate status
 competitions - so that status is derived purely from economic rewards is
 also unrealistic.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"

\end_inset

 argue, the reality is often somewhere in between the two extremes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A structural model for this interplay between economic and social goals
 is however yet to specified in either sociology or economics.
 The dominant view for status in both sociology and economics has been one
 that is based on hierarchy and social deference (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990,goldthorpesociology2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - a view that is inherent in occupational status surveys widely used in
 empirical studies (e.g.
 the EGP classes or the Goldthorpe class scheme).
 A fundamental problem that the sociology literature has elaborated (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) in empirical analyses is a failure to reconcile the difference between
 objective aspects of status (the observed reality of status differences)
 and its subjective aspects (the effect of status differences on individual
 behaviour).
 An evident issue with addressing only the objective aspect of status using
 a utilitarian model while leaving the subjective aspect exogenous is that
 status may never be explained in economic terms while an economy for status
 is ruled out.
 As many have argued, the idea of social-closure (aggregate or stände first
 discussed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "webereconomysociety1925"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) in sociology cannot be conflated with that of social ranks (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Indeed the issue is not merely a theoretical one.
 It has been suggested that the subjective evaluations of status often measure
 an overall desirability of occupations rather than status (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "adlerstatuscomponents1985"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argue that skills or knowledge of individuals may better predict the individual
 judgments of status.
 Further, the scales of status used in empirical studies are also observed
 to vary significantly across the sections of a society (

Several approaches have aimed to reconcile the difference between objective

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 addresses the issue by simply ensuring that the subjective and objective
 aspects coincide in status-related interpretations.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 argues that the basic categories in terms of which we describe a system
 of hierarchies as a structure is the same as those in terms of which individual
 behavior or performance should be defined.
 While culture places a premium on equality, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "parsonssystemsocieties1971"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues, the distribution rules in different social subsystems are not aimed
 at generating equality - thus letting status exist to assert basic importance
 of equality of membership status while also making allowances for inequalities
 resulting from equality of opportunity (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 The bottom line of the arguments from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for example consider power as a commodity to be exchanged in the economy
 - an approach that has drawn much criticism due to the zero-sum characteristics
 it imposes on status while treating the total status on a status society
 as fixed (

 The current chapter leans towards the view from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"

\end_inset

 who argued that as a product of exchange processes, status is likely to
 be available in ample supply in a society.
 The economic and social goals of the individual are connected in the presented
 model with a probability function arising out of a priori distribution
 of personal attributes.
 Instead of using status as a wealth-determined goal, status is considered
 only of an indirect role in maximisation of consumer utility from wealth
 (

 A similar model is implemented by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 where a participants have a concern for relative standing because of their
 standing being instrumental in determining ultimate consumption levels
 rather than being directly contributing to their utility.

The probability function bears some similarity with the Tullock function
 used in contest theory approaches (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Further, the set up of an all-pay auction in contest theory has also been
 advanced with introduction multiples stages (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "parcorepoportamaldossTwoStageBudget2005,SteinRapoportsymmetrictwostagecontests2005"

\end_inset

).
 There are however some key simplifications in the model that is used in
 the current chapter.
 Unlike the setting for two-stage contests explored in the contest theory
 literature - where the first-stage is used to limit the number of players
 participating in the second-stage (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BayeKavenockdeVries1993LobbyingTwoPlayer,AmegashieDesignofRentSeekingCompetitions1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the stages of the game presented in the current chapter only uses second-stag
e to represent the last time-horizon (i.e.
 end of lifetime) of the participant.
 The distribution of budget across the two-stages of the game is also of
 little concern in the setting explored in the current chapter since it's
 only the first-stage of the game when the expenditure can be less than
 the total budget.
 The expenditure in the second-stage amounts to the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 for the poor participant and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 for the rich participant.
 It's only in the first-stage, strictly speaking, therefore that the consumption
 decisions are made by either participant.

\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$

 Here,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To discuss implication with a much simpler competition first, let's consider
 a competition where participants compete with raw-talents alone, so that
 the consumer with maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 wins.
 In a competition of raw-talents, the winner is a player 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{r_{i}<r_{j}\forall i\in[1,N]\}$
\end_inset

 and the probability that a given participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of raw-skill 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the winner is essentially that of all other players 
\begin_inset Formula $j\ne i$
\end_inset

 having ability 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{j\ne i}$
\end_inset

 less than 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}{P(r_{i}>r_{1})\times P(r_{i}>r_{2})\times...P(r_{i}>r_{i-1})\times P(r_{i}>r_{i+1})...P(r>r_{N})}dr_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 With a uniform distribution of skills 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $P(r_{i}\ge r)=r_{i}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,N]$
\end_inset

 and therefore, the probability is evaluates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}{(r_{i})^{N-1}}dr_{i}=\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

.
 With more players, the chances of a particular participant winning declines.

\begin_layout Standard
Introducing the skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 which are curated in social institutions, we consider a threshold investment
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$

 which is necessary to be spent for the social capital to be available to
 a participant.
 While this is an arrangement that evidently favours the rich participant,
 there are also diminsihing returns to investing 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 towards the richer position.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An imporant assumption in the foregoing analysis is that raw-talent is less
 valued than skills cultivated by institutions.
 As as result, we can use the condition

 different probabilities to win depending on whether they spend

 More specifically, the participant takes advantage of the skills with weight

 In the all-or-nothing payment scheme, the participant might avoid the investmen

\begin_layout Standard
In the game where a participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 with the maximum score 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the winner, the number of rich positions is fixed to 
\begin_inset Formula $N-P$
\end_inset

 so that only the top-scorer gets to occupy the only rich position available
 to be filled in every competition.
 The expected behaviour of the rich and the poor participants in the long-term
 can be explained with four different cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case I - The poor participant does not participate due to insufficient investmen
t 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 while the rich participant does participate by spending 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case II - The rich participant does not participate with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 but the poor participant does participate i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case III - Both poor and rich participants do not participate so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case IV - Both poor rich and participant participate with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Case I, the poor participant can win when her raw-talent (weighted
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

) is higher than the total score of all other poor participants as well
 as the total score of the rich participants (who compete with acquired
 skills).
 The poor are priced out of accessing any skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in their score in Case I so that only the rich participants with investment
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 have skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s>0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, a given poor participant must be ahead both of all of the poor participan
ts and the rich participants so that a participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 may win only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is higher than than raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{k}$
\end_inset

 in all poor participants and also exceeds the score

With the uniform density for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.

\end_inset

 ), total probability to win can be calculated as
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that since only one participant can win the skills-game, the probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}P_{2}(\text{win}|r_{i},s_{i})ds_{i}dr_{i}$
\end_inset

 for a rich participant to win is simply

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case II, when the rich person does not participate (i.e.
 all rich participants have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

), the poor participant has the skills-advantage in the game so the the
 probability to win for the poor participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
P(\text{win}|r_{i})=\prod_{k=1,k\ne i}^{P}P(\mu r_{k}+(1-\mu)s_{k}<\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i})\prod_{k=P+1}^{N}P(\mu r_{k}<\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i})\\

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case III, when neither the rich nor the poor participate in the game,
 then the game depends only on raw-talents and all participants have the
 same probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

 to win the game.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{N}}{N}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\text{win}|r_{i})=\prod_{k=1,k\ne i}^{P}P(r_{k}<r_{i})\prod_{k=P+1}^{N}P(r_{k}<r_{i})=r_{i}{}^{N-1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case IV, when both rich and poor participants set 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Using symmetry arguments, this winning probability also turns out to be
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

 for all the participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the effect of expenditure on the winning probabilit
y is weakened with higher number of participants in the game where abilities
 (both skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 relevant for social capital and the raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

) are uniformly distributed.
 In other words, if poor and rich participants were to be considered as
 two separate groups, then the effect of expenditure on their wins declines
 when more and more participants are sampled with varied raw-talents and
 skills.

Case I
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case I, the poor participant can win when her raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 is higher than of the total score of rich participant (who competes with
 acquired skills) as well as the raw-talent (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}'$
\end_inset

 ) of the only other poor participant in the three-player game.
 Both the poor participants are priced out of accessing any skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in their score so that the skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s>0$
\end_inset

 is only true for the rich participant having 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the poor participant with raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 can win with the following probability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P(\text{win}|r_{1}) & =P(\mu r_{2}+(1-\mu)s_{2}<\mu r_{1})P(r_{1}'<r_{1})=F_{X}(\mu r_{1})r_{1}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{1}<\mu<1-\mu<1$
\end_inset

 is implied due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 ).
 The probability that the total score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{2}+(1-\mu)s_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{1}$
\end_inset

 implies that only the first part of the piecewise function for 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{X}(x)$
\end_inset

 needs to be considered.
 Therefore, using 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\text{win}|r_{1})=\frac{\mu^{2}r_{1}^{3}}{2\mu(1-\mu)}$
\end_inset

, we evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}(\text{win})$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula

In Case II, the rich person does not participate (

 A poor participant wins by having the total score higher than the other

\begin_layout Standard
In Case III, when neither the rich nor the poor participate in the game,
 then the game depends only on raw-talents and all participants have the
 same probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

 to win the game.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{3}}{3}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

Case IV
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case IV, when both rich and poor participants set 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, then the poor participant can win only if her score 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$

 poor participant.
 Therefore,

0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this integral can be evaluated based on symmetry arguments ( since
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is also randomly distributed), the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{s_{1}=0}^{s_{1}=1}\int_{r_{1}=0}^{r_{1}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{1},s_{1})dr_{1}ds_{1}$

), the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<1/2$
\end_inset

 - indicating that curated skills are given more importance that raw-talent
 in the competitions - means that the poor participant is strictly better
 off (than facing probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

) if she participates while the rich participant doesn't participate (Case
 II).
 Also, the poor participant is better off participating for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 when the rich participant does participate as it raise the probability
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

.
 That the competition becomes uncompetitive both when threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 falls too much (letting both participants participate) or rises too much
 (letting both both participants withdraw) also follows from the properties
 of the winning probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the rich participant could withdraw and face either 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

 or lower probability (when the poor participant participates).
 By participating, therefore, the rich participant would either face probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

 (when poor participant also participates) or better (if the poor participant
 withdraws).
 Considering the probabilities alone, the rich participant would always
 participate.
 If the rich participant always participates, then so long as budget constraints
 permit, the poor participant is also better off participating since not
 participating brings her probability to win below 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

.
 If the utility was from probability alone, then both participants would
 participate and face 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

 probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, since participants are more likely to face a finite life-time and
 utility from accumulated assets, they hardly optimise the probability to
 win in the game.
 We therefore explore the case where the participants optimise an intertemporall
y additive utility over their life-time.
 The equilibrium based on utility from accumulated assets is discussed in

We now discuss Nash equilibria conditions for whether the Case I, II, III,
 IV outlined above and discuss the implications of the results for the effect
 of income differences on expenditure towards status.
 It is worth remarking that our discussion of the effect of the threshold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and the income differences 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on participation (expenditure) assumes that the exogenous parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is stable with respect to short-term changes in threshold investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 as well as disposable incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1},y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For ease of notation we define 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}\equiv\frac{\mu}{8(1-\mu)}$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}\equiv1-2p_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}'\equiv\frac{19\mu^{2}-40\mu+20}{40(1-\mu)^{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}'\equiv1-2p_{1}'$
\end_inset

 which correspond to the three-player model discussed above.
 The consumer choices for the poor and rich participants using a general
 intertemporally additive function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)$
\end_inset

 (for assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prisoners_dilemma"
plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 As we can verify from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Probability-of-winning"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that we have 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}<1/3<p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and

Notice the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 represents the condition when the budget is non-binding i.e.
 the poor participant is able to spend 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}<y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 When the poor participant faces a binding constraint i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

 , then the rich participant knows that the best case probability to win
 for the poor participant is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The rich participant's decision to participate would depend only on utility
 from savings and the relative advantage from gain in probability.
 This is elaborated further in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:Binding-constraint"
plural "false"

Binding constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming EUT participants we first consider the simpler case of binding
 constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we assume a stability in long-term participant behaviour (which itself
 is a result of observed probability of success), mixed-strategies are not
 relevant in the current set up.
 Considering pure strategies for participation, the rich participant would
 thus participate only when the utility from participating would be higher
 than from not participating i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})+\frac{p_{2}u(y_{2})+(1-p_{2})u(y_{1})}{\delta}>u(y_{2})+\frac{\frac{1}{3}u(y_{2})+\frac{2}{3}u(y_{1})}{\delta}$
\end_inset

 .
 This results in the following condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{(p_{2}-1/3)(u(y_{2})-u(y_{1}))}{\delta} & >u(y_{2})-u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With income differences being the same an increase in participation cost
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 discourages participation since RHS increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\because u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})$
\end_inset

 is decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

) and may fail the above condition.
 Similarly, with participation cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 being the same, an increase in income-difference 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is in the rich participant's interest whereas a narrowing of income differences
 reduces incentive for the participant to participate by possibly failing
 the above condition.
 All else being the same, higher impatience (lower time-discounted value
 of money or a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

) would also discourage participation.
 Therefore, when budget is binding for the poor participant i.e.
 if the poor participant cannot participate due to 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, then narrower income differences, higher participation costs and higher
 patience for savings (common for both rich and poor participants) all encourage
 the rich participant to withdraw from the game.
 This also means that wider income differences (
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

) combined with lower participation costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\mu}$
\end_inset

) may together help maintain the equilibrium where only the rich participates.
 Similarly, wider income differences ( higher
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 ) and more patience for savings (higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 ) would together maintain the incentive for the rich participant to participate.
 These conclusions very much fit with the sociological observations made
 in the literature about status (

).

\end_layout

\end_inset

) remain the same for the above condition.
 To discuss the more general Nash equilibria, we now consider the conditions
 for all of the Cases I, II, III and IV to become a Nash equilibrium.
 For ease of notation we define the following for a given

Consider now that conditions for Case I to be a Nash Equilibrium.
 If Case I were to be a Nash equilibrium, then for the rich participant's
 decision to participate, the poor participant must get more utility from
 withdrawing than from participating and for poor participant's decision
 to withdraw, the rich must get more utility from participating than from
 withdrawing.

 which necessitates
\begin_inset Formula $U_{2}<U_{1}$

 Thus an equilibrium with Case II which incentivises the poor to participate

 Similarly, higher income differences (an increase in

 a fragile one.

 So long as the poorer participant finds the competition worthwhile, the

It's worth highlighting that these results are not limited to a discrete
 response cost-function and that more general cost-functions also confirm
 a similar effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$

.
 Unlike the discrete response function where a participant misses out on
 skills completely if she does not spend a certain threshold payment, we
 run Monte Carlo simulations with a skills-multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $c(x)$
\end_inset

 for social-capital which lets every participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 have the score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)c(x)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 so that skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are realised fully (
\begin_inset Formula $c(x)=1$
\end_inset

) only at limit.
 As with the discrete response, skills are 0 for no expenditure/effort in
 this continuous response cost-function.
 Here too, we find that the poor participant backs out from (reduces) expenditur
e while the rich increases her expenditure in the Nash equilibrium.

The above framework also allows us to discuss the implications of inequality
 for the same total wealth in the economy.
 As such, a segregation where the poor never participate in the status economy
 seems less favourable than one where both rich and poor participate in
 the status competitions.
 What the model shows is that only a reference-based utility (which may
 be encouraged with segregation) could permit an equilibrium where the poor
 could participate in status games with respect to skills-enhancement.
 While an equilibrium can be offered by environments of contentment with
 lower wealth (reference-dependent utility) where skills-enhancement remains
 popular among lower-income participants, the equilibrium under diminishing
 utility from wealth only offers an environment where only rich may be concerned
 with skills-leading to economics success.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have considered a model where status amounts to a position that cements
 the participant's economic position but only temporarily.
 The goal of the model has been to investigate role of income difference
 on expenditures that carry some status while also having some effect on
 the income mobility of the participants.
 The endogenisation of status in this manner allows us to use the framework
 to explain this role of income difference across economies with wide-difference
s in cultural notions that are associated with status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foremost result is that under diminishing utility from wealth, the only
 two stable equilibria are those where both rich and poor participate in
 status competitions and those only rich benefit from status competitions.
 The role of a reference-based utility also shows an important caveat to
 these results since contentment at lower levels of wealth could lead to
 competitions of wealth that engage the poor while the rich having little
 concern about such competitions.

% The main idea is to calculate the total probability over r_{i}.
 One objection that can be raised is that the total probability must be
 calculated in one big integration rather than first calculating probability
 for given r_{i},s_{i} and then letting r_{i} and s_{i} vary independently.
 But this objection can be addressed by considering the sample space of
 r_{i}.
 It seems valid to consider the conditional probability of winning by considerin

 As long as r_{i} , s_{i} are being varied for one participant alone, the

\begin_layout Standard
To calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{s=0}^{s=1}\int_{r=0}^{r=1}P(\text{win}|r,s)drds$
\end_inset

 over the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $0<r<1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0<s<1$
\end_inset

), we evaluate the sum of three parts split by the boundaries of the piecewise
 function.
 The three parts are shown in Figure

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\mu r+(1-\mu)s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

 is of the following piece-wise form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
F(x) & =\begin{cases}
A & 0<x<\mu\\
B & \mu<x<1-\mu\\
C & 1-\mu<x<1\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

Then the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{s=0}^{s=1}\int_{r=0}^{r=1}F(x)drds$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{s=0}^{s=1}\int_{r=0}^{r=1}F(x)dsdr & =\int_{r=0}^{r=1}{\int_{s=0}^{s=\frac{\mu(1-r)}{1-\mu}}A\ dsdr}+\int_{r=0}^{r=1}{\int_{s=\frac{\mu(1-r)}{1-\mu}}^{s=1-\frac{\mu r}{1-\mu}}B\ dsdr}+\int_{r=0}^{r=1}{\int_{s=1-\frac{\mu r}{1-\mu}}^{s=1}C\ dsdr}
