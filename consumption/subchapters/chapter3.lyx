%There are a few perspectives towards status that are left out in this overview
 - such as the social-network view (see [#degenneintroducingsocialnetworks1999]).
 or the fully rationalist (individualist) perspective (see [#elsterrationalchoic

 Due to the limitations of data captured in a typical consumer survey that
 focus primarily on consumption and family-level characteristics, the conception
s based on social-proximity or individualist perspectives are less relevant
 in our discussion.

% It is worth remarking that the above view of status does not accommodate
 a social network based view of status.
 One could argue against the random distribution of attributes, given that
 many attributes are governed by parental upbringing (The literature does
 often consider a uniform distribution of skills to answer questions related
 to status-related consumption [#hopkinsWhichInequality2010].) .
 However, the above set up focuses on role of expenditure in the specific
 context of a society where

 The assumption that skills-relevant to such a competition are randomly
 distributed may thus be hardly restrictive for such a growing economy.

The predominant view of status in empirical economics is of a hierarchy
 of social ranks.
 While empirical studies often treat status concerns inherent in observed
 social ranks separately from economic concerns, the sociological literature
 also explores the link between status perceptions and economic goals.
 An important concern for the sociological literature has been to reconcile
 the subjective aspects of status with its objective aspects.
 The current chapter focuses on a particular structural basis for a dynamism
 linking economic and social goals using probability functions that determine
 the promotion and demotion of participants among rich and poor classes
 in an economy.
 The consumer behaviour in response to participation costs and income difference
s are then explained while considering a promotion probability driven by
 two characteristics of the consumer - social capital comprising of skills
 that can be enhanced with expenditure and raw-talents that are unaffected
 by higher expenditure.
 Assuming a diminishing returns to utility from wealth optimised by the
 consumer, we find that a rise in income differences provides more incentive
 to participate in status competitions.
 The solution also suggests only two possible states for the economy - one
 where both rich and poor strive for status and the other where only the
 rich consumers participate in status competitions.

While the predominant view of status in empirical economics remains one
 that is based on hierarchy of ranks (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goldthorpeOccupationalGrading1975,wegener1992prestigeconcepts,goldthorpesociology2000"

\end_inset

), several attempts have been made in both sociology and economics to view
 status in a more dynamic framework (

key "webereconomysociety1925,shilsDeference1969,parsonssystemsocieties1971,ColemanSocialTheory1990,wegener1992prestigeconcepts"

\end_inset

).
 Instead of treating status goals separate from economic goals, the presented
 chapter pins down a specific link between economics and social goals relevant
 for status consumption assuming an indirect (instrumental) effect of status
 on consumer wealth (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A contrast between economic and social goals seems has received far more
 attention in sociological literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - where the issue of reconciling subjective aspects of status (the effect
 of status differences on individual behaviour) with its objective aspects
 (the observed reality of status differences) has been explored in great
 detail.
 There seem two broad categories (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) which the various theories for status can be classified into - those that
 consider status as a hierarchical order (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "parsonssystemsocieties1971,wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) and those that consider it in terms of a conflict among social groups
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "webereconomysociety1925,wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Several approaches in economics have also incorporated views from the sociologi
cal literature while using a dynamism in the social order relevant for status
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes,moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The current chapter relies upon one such view of status (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - as a product of economic processes shaped by institutional nurturing
 or discouragement of individual attributes (also see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Given the extreme variation of economic development that are observed across
 developing economies (such as Tanzania and Nigeria), the endogenisation
 of status in such a manner provides us a generic framework to compare disparate
 developing economies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Focusing on the specific problem of how variation in urban institutions
 could influence expenditures such as education that carry some status but
 also contribute to future income mobility, the proposed chapter evaluates
 theoretical arguments for how expenditure towards status could respond
 to changes in income differences and participation costs under urbanisation-rel
ated changes.
 Unlike the typical attribution of status to exogenous factors such as race
 or caste, the current approach views status under urbansiation in a common
 Weberian framework contrasting

To specify a structural relationship between the economic and social goals
 of an individual, the current chapter uses probability functions that define
 promotion to a richer status class.
 While the probability of promotion for the consumer is driven by her expenditur
e, the utility for the consumer comes only from her accumulated wealth.
 Our approach where participants do not consider the rich status directly
 into the utility (and therefore do not directly maximise the chances to
 be rich) - follows 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 closely who also discuss the relevance of uncertainty in conspicuous consumptio
n.
 In the probabilistic game we use to represent status compeitions, the participa
nts compete both with raw-talent and acquired-skills (social capital) to
 get promoted to (or to maintain) a rich position.
 More specifically, the winner of the game is promoted to a rich position
 (or maintains her rich position) by having the maximum total score comprising
 both of raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (uniformly distributed in a population) and social capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (enhanced with expenditure).
 The social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 that is enhanced through expenditure is also subject to budget constraints
 imposed on the consumer
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We do not view leisure as separate from budget constraints in the model.
 In other words, the leisure relevant for higher stauts is interpreted simply
 as a higher cost for the poorer participant.
 So long as once can view leisure as the amount of money a participant must
 forgo in order to participate in status competition, the leisure differences
 can be also viewed as differences in disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the only two types of participants in the tournamen
t view of status used in the current chapter are the poor and rich classes
 - so that the investments towards status (such as club-membership fees,
 or higher-education) increase the chances to be promoted to the rich status.
 Those who don't participate in the tournament certainly suffer with being
 poor, but those who do spend only benefit probabilistically.
 A useful analogy to explain such a competition is that of tennis leagues
 - where rewards are risky but are unlike lotteries in that more expenditure
 does not linearly increase one's chance to win in a tennis championship.
 As with the game of tennis, participants with appropriate raw-talent and
 skills may exist naturally in a population but their success also depends
 on engagement with other tennis players.
 More specifically, there may exist biological characteristics such as strength,
 dexterity, height or psychological abilities (resilience, conscientiousness
 etc.) that help one's tennis, but there also exist several characteristics
 such as technique, rankings, knowledge of conventions, racket-customisations
 that are only available at a significant cost to the participant.
 The enhancement of these latter skills (social capital) are what the institutio
nal support are meant to represent.
 It has been argued more generally that the characteristics of status games
 are often made to reward curated abilities rather than naturally occurring
 raw-strengths (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the weight 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 of raw-talent in the maximum total score considered for the win, the consumer
 preferences for the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 ( where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is raw-talent and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are skills that are available with higher expenditure) are considered under
 the assumption that the participants maintain the population constant over
 time.
 The rich participants are thus replaced by either a rich or poor participant
 only through the tournament that selects highest combined score regardless
 of rich or poor background of the participant.
 Since all participants participate in every such tournament, it is possible
 for a rich participant to lose her rich-position and let another participant
 acquire her position.
 We also assume that the preferences for all poor participants are the same
 as are the preferences of all the rich participants.
 Having a rich or a poor status by itself only has an indirect effect (through
 higher expenditure or budget) on the chance to be promoted (or maintaining
 one's rich position) - a probability that otherwise depends on the privately
 known ability 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 All rich participants and all poor participants having the same behaviour
 also means that the privately known attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are not used by the participant to decide upon the expenditure (effort)
 towards the status game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that if the rich and poor participants have disparate incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

), then the above setup evidently puts the poor participants at a disadvantage
 since they may not afford to pay the costs to enhance their skills (i.e.
 realise the true worth of their skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 due to high participation costs).
 However, since both raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (the latter enhanced by costly institutional support) are randomly distributed
 in the population, the competition may never rule out the chance for a
 poor participant to win.
 For the same reason, the returns from investments to enhance one's skills
 may also be diminishing since one cannot beat raw-talent and non enhanced-skill
s after a certain point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to highlight that above status competitions are not meant
 to be population-wide tournaments that involve all participants of a society.
 Instead, the competitions are small-scale with varied locally defined criteria
 that may have multiple stages.
 All such competitions are meant to be independent and may vary only in
 the threshold participation cost and range of distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i},s_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the participants.
 As scope of the presented chapter is limited to the effect of income difference
s on consumption, we discuss only a particular competition with known distributi
on of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 among a relatively small number of participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, a few properties of a game follow where a wealth-optimising
 participant with a maximum score wins by enhancing her skills (social capital)
 and using her raw-talent.
 First, only one player with the maximum score can win a particular tournament.
 Second, the rank of the participant (rich / poor status) is of no direct
 significance part of her utility from wealth.
 Lastly, the privately known raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are of no significance to expenditure decisions - which vary solely on
 the basis of rich or poor status.
 A closed-form solution with a diminishing utility from wealth and a threshold
 level expenditure required for participants to spend in order to avail
 social capital suggests that the only two equilibria relevant for status
 consumption are one where rich as well as poor consumer participates in
 the status competitions and one where only the rich consumer engage in
 competitions.
 Further, the higher income differences seem to encourage both poor and
 rich participants to engage in status competitions while high participation
 costs discourage the participation from the poor participant.
 On similar lines with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in the context of status competitions.

Status is often contrasted as a social goal of an individual against her
 economic goals.
 Yet the difference between social and economic goals of the individual
 remains unclear in both sociology and economics (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The idea that status is orthogonal to economic goals - or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

pure status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 view (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) - seldom fits with the real-world where status both contributes to income
 and improves with rises in income.
 Indeed the other extreme view that the economic goals alone motivate status
 competitions - so that status is derived purely from economic rewards is
 also unrealistic.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007"

\end_inset

 argue, the reality is often somewhere in between the two extremes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A structural model for the interplay between economic and social goals is
 yet to specified in either sociology or economics.
 The dominant view for status in both sociology and economics has been based
 on hierarchy and social deference (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990,goldthorpesociology2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - a view that is inherent in occupational status surveys widely used in
 empirical studies (e.g.
 the EGP classes or the Goldthorpe class scheme).
 A fundamental problem that the sociology literature has elaborated further
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is the failure in empirical studies to reconcile the difference between
 objective aspects of status (the observed reality of status differences)
 and its subjective aspects (the effect of status differences on individual
 behaviour).
 An evident issue with addressing only the objective aspect of status using
 a utilitarian model while leaving the subjective aspect exogenous is that
 status may never be explained in economic terms when an economy for status
 is ruled out.
 As the literature in sociology warns, the idea of social-closure (aggregate
 or stände first discussed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "webereconomysociety1925"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) ought not be conflated with that of social ranks (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The issue is not a mere theoretical one.
 Empirical studies suggest that the subjective (private) evaluations of
 status often measure an overall desirability of occupations rather than
 common objective notions for status (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goldthorpeOccupationalGrading1975"

).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 find that skills or knowledge of individuals to be a better predictor for
 individual judgments of status.
 Lastly, the scales of status used in empirical studies are observed to
 vary significantly across the sections of a society as well (

Several approaches have aimed to reconcile the difference between objective

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 argues that the basic categories in terms of which we describe a system
 of hierarchies as a structure is the same as those in terms of which individual
 behavior or performance should be defined.
 While culture places a premium on equality, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "parsonssystemsocieties1971"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 argues, the distribution rules in different social subsystems are not aimed
 at generating equality - thus letting status exist to assert basic importance
 of equality of membership status while also making allowances for inequalities
 resulting from equality of opportunity (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The bottom line of these arguments is that societies must institutionalize
 some balance between equality and inequality at all times (

 Instead of interpreting status items as those that signal hierarchical
 status, the dynamic view of status allows

 to suggest that investments towards status may increase the likelihood

Other attempts to reconcile the subjective and objective aspects of status
 (and therefore of social-closure and hierarchy) use rational conflict-based
 arguments to specify the structural basis for status.

, for example, consider power (purportedly amounting to status) as a commodity
 to be exchanged in the economy - an approach that has drawn much criticism
 due to the zero-sum characteristics it imposes on status while treating
 the total status on a status society as fixed (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wrongpower1979"

\end_inset

).
 The current chapter instead leans towards the view from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "goode1978celebrationheroes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who had argued that as a product of exchange processes, status is likely
 to be available in ample supply in a society.
 To specify the processes that link the economic and social goals of the
 individual, the current chapter uses probability functions leading to hierarchi
cal promotion that depend on an 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 distribution of personal attributes.
 Instead of using status as a wealth-determined goal, the presented chapter
 follows an approach suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to consider status only of an indirect role in maximisation of consumer
 utility from wealth.
 A similar model is implemented by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where a participants have a concern for relative standing because of their
 standing being instrumental in determining ultimate consumption levels
 rather than being directly contributing to their utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above probability function approach bears some similarity with the Tullock
 function used in contest theory approaches as well (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tullock1967"

\end_inset

).
 Further developments in the contest-theory literature relating to multiple
 stage contests (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "parcorepoportamaldossTwoStageBudget2005,SteinRapoportsymmetrictwostagecontests2005"

literal "false"

\end_inset

) have also explored contexts similar to the model proposed in the current
 chapter.
 However, the approach used in the current chapter remains much simpler
 than that of a multi-stage Tullock contest under budget-constraints.
 Unlike the setting for two-stage contests explored in the contest theory
 literature - where the first-stage is used to limit the number of players
 participating in the second-stage (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BayeKavenockdeVries1993LobbyingTwoPlayer,AmegashieDesignofRentSeekingCompetitions1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - the game presented in the current chapter only uses second-stage to
 represent the last time-horizon (i.e.
 end of lifetime) of the participant rather than as a stage to eliminate
 players for the second-stage.
 The distribution of budget across the two-stages of the game is also of
 little concern in the setting explored in the current chapter since it's
 only the first-stage of the game when the expenditure can be less than
 the total budget.
 More particularly, the expenditure in the second-stage simply amounts to
 the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 for the poor participant and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 for the rich participant.
 It's only in the first-stage, strictly speaking, therefore that the consumption
 decisions are made by either participant.

 Here,

 In other words, the winner in a competition of raw-talents is a player
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{r_{i}<r_{j}\forall i\in[1,N]\}$

 a participant.
 While this is an arrangement that evidently favours the rich participant,
 there are also diminsihing returns to investing

 towards the richer position.
 
\end_layout

An imporant assumption in the foregoing analysis is that raw-talent is less
 valued than skills cultivated by institutions.
 As as result, we use the condition

 different probabilities to win depending on whether they spend

 More specifically, the participant takes advantage of the skills with weight

 In the all-or-nothing payment scheme, the participant might avoid the investmen

In the game where a participant

 with the maximum score

 is the winner, the number of rich positions is fixed to 
\begin_inset Formula $N-P$
\end_inset

 so that only the top-scorer gets to occupy the only rich position available
 to be filled in every competition.
 The expected behaviour of the rich and the poor participants in the long-term
 can be explained with four different cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Case I - The poor participant does not participate due to insufficient investmen

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0$

\begin_layout Itemize
Case II - The rich participant does not participate with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=0$

With Case I, the poor participant can win when her raw-talent (weighted
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 as the total score of the rich participants (who compete with acquired
 skills).
 The poor are priced out of accessing any skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 in their score in Case I so that only the rich participants with investment
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 have skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s>0$

 Thus, a given poor participant must be ahead both of all of the poor participan

\begin_inset Formula $i$

With the uniform density for

\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}$
\end_inset

 Notice that since only one participant can win the skills-game, the probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}P_{2}(\text{win}|r_{i},s_{i})ds_{i}dr_{i}$
\end_inset

 for a rich participant to win is simply

\begin_layout Standard
In Case II, when the rich person does not participate (i.e.
 all rich participants have

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

In Case III, when neither the rich nor the poor participate in the game,
 then the game depends only on raw-talents and all participants have the

 to win the game.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{N}}{N}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

Using symmetry arguments, this winning probability also turns out to be

It is worth emphasising that the effect of expenditure on the winning probabilit
y is weakened with higher number of participants in the game where abilities
 (both skills

 relevant for social capital and the raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$

 In other words, if poor and rich participants were to be considered as
 two separate groups, then the effect of expenditure on their wins declines
 when more and more participants are sampled with varied raw-talents and
 skills.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case I, the poor participant can win when her raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 is higher than of the total score of rich participant (who competes with
 acquired skills).
 The poor participant is priced out of accessing any skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

\begin_inset Formula $s>0$
\end_inset

 is only true for the rich participant having 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 Thus, the poor participant with raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 can win with the following probability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{1}<\mu<1-\mu<1$
\end_inset

 is implied due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 ).
 The probability that the total score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{2}+(1-\mu)s_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{1}$
\end_inset

 implies that only the first part of the piecewise function for 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{X}(x)$
\end_inset

 needs to be considered.
 Therefore, using

), the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<1/2$

 in the competitions - means that the poor participant is strictly better
 off (than facing probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$

 II).
 Also, the poor participant is better off participating for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

.
 That the competition becomes uncompetitive both when threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 falls too much (letting both participants participate) or rises too much
 (letting both both participants withdraw) also follows from the properties
 of the winning probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the rich participant could withdraw and face either 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 or lower probability (when the poor participant participates).
 By participating, therefore, the rich participant would either face probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 (when poor participant also participates) or better (if the poor participant
 withdraws).
 Considering the probabilities alone, the rich participant would always
 participate.
 If the rich participant always participates, then so long as budget constraints
 permit, the poor participant is also better off participating since not
 participating brings her probability to win below 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

.
 If the utility was from probability alone, then both participants would
 participate and face 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$

However, the participants are more likely to face a finite life-time and

=======
However, since participants are more likely to face a finite life-time and
 utility from accumulated assets, they hardly optimise the probability to
 win in the game.
 We therefore explore the more likely case where the participants optimise
 an intertemporally additive utility over their life-time.
 The life-time in the model is represented with two time-horizons - where
 the second-time horizon is one before the end of life when all wealth accumulat
ed by either participant must disappear.
 With no accumulations at the end of life, both rich and poor participants
 must decide to spend all their incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 (for poor and rich participants respectively) towards the promotion game.
 In the first-stage, however, the participants decide the amount to be spent
 towards promotion based upon the utility from wealth they obtain across
 the two time-horizons that span their lifetime.
 For the poor participant, the total utility to be optimised (assuming EUT)
 under the intertemporally additive utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\cdot)$
\end_inset

, a winning probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $W(x)$
\end_inset

 (for expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, for the rich participant, the total utility to be optimised (assuming
 EUT) is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(y_{2}-\nu_{2})+\frac{1}{\delta}((1-W(y_{2}))u(y_{1})+W(y_{2})u(y_{2}))

With above utilities, we discuss conditions for whether the Case I, II,
 III, IV can become Nash equilibria (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prisoners_dilemma_cases"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We then proceed to discuss the implications for the effect of income difference
s on expenditure towards status.
 It is worth remarking that our discussion of the effect of the threshold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and the income differences 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on participation (expenditure) assumes that the exogenous parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is stable with respect to short-term changes in threshold investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 as well as disposable incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1},y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For ease of notation we define 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}\equiv\frac{\mu}{6(1-\mu)}$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}\equiv1-p_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}'\equiv\frac{6-7\mu}{6(1-\mu)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}'\equiv1-p_{1}'$
\end_inset

 which correspond to the two-player model discussed above.
 The consumer choices for the poor and rich participants using a general
 intertemporally additive function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)$
\end_inset

 (for assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prisoners_dilemma"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As we can verify from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Probability-of-winning"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that we have 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}<1/2<p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}'>1/2>p_{2}'$
\end_inset

 for all values of

Notice the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prisoners_dilemma"

\end_inset

 represents the condition when the budget is non-binding i.e.
 the poor participant is able to spend 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}<y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 When the poor participant faces a binding constraint i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

 , then the rich participant knows that the best case probability to win
 for the poor participant is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The rich participant's decision to participate would depend only on utility
 from savings and the relative advantage from gain in probability.
 This is elaborated further in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Assuming EUT participants we first consider the simpler case of binding
 constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we assume a stability in long-term participant behaviour (which itself
 is a result of observed probability of success), mixed-strategies are not
 relevant in the current set up.
 Considering pure strategies for participation, the rich participant would
 thus participate only when the utility from participating would be higher
 than from not participating i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})+\frac{p_{2}u(y_{2})+(1-p_{2})u(y_{1})}{\delta}>u(y_{2})+\frac{u(y_{2})+u(y_{1})}{2\delta}$
\end_inset

 .
 This results in the following condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{(p_{2}-1/2)(u(y_{2})-u(y_{1}))}{\delta} & >u(y_{2})-u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With income differences being the same an increase in participation cost
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 discourages participation since RHS increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\because u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})$
\end_inset

 is decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

) and may fail the above condition.
 Similarly, with participation cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 being the same, an increase in income-difference 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is in the rich participant's interest whereas a narrowing of income differences
 reduces incentive for the participant to participate by possibly failing
 the above condition.
 All else being the same, higher impatience (lower time-discounted value
 of money or a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

) would also discourage participation.
 Therefore, when budget is binding for the poor participant i.e.
 if the poor participant cannot participate due to 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, then narrower income differences, higher participation costs and higher
 patience for savings (common for both rich and poor participants) all encourage
 the rich participant to withdraw from the game.
 This also means that wider income differences (
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

) combined with lower participation costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\mu}$
\end_inset

) may together help maintain the equilibrium where only the rich participates.
 Similarly, wider income differences ( higher
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 ) and more patience for savings (higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 ) would together maintain the incentive for the rich participant to participate.
 These conclusions very much fit with the sociological observations made
 in the literature about status (

 Similarly, higher income differences (an increase in

 Conversely, if the game is not lucrative for the rich it would automatically

\begin_inset Formula $U_{2}<U_{1}$

 participate.
 So long as the poorer participant finds the competition worthwhile, the

It's worth highlighting that these results are not limited to a discrete
 response cost-function and that more general cost-functions also confirm
 a similar effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Unlike the discrete response function where a participant misses out on
 skills completely if she does not spend a certain threshold payment, we
 run Monte Carlo simulations with a skills-multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $c(x)$
\end_inset

 for social-capital which lets every participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 have the score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)c(x)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 so that skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are realised fully (
\begin_inset Formula $c(x)=1$
\end_inset

) only at limit.
 As with the discrete response, skills are 0 for no expenditure/effort in
 this continuous response cost-function.
 Here too, we find that the poor participant backs out from (reduces) expenditur
e while the rich increases her expenditure in the Nash equilibrium.

The above framework also allows us to discuss the implications of inequality
 for the same total wealth in the economy.
 As such, a segregation where the poor never participate in the status economy
 seems less favourable than one where both rich and poor participate in
 the status competitions.
 The current chapter explains that the likely outcome of a failure to maintain
 universal participation in status games (under diminishing utility from
 wealth) is that of a segregation where only the rich participate in skills
 leading to economic success.
 While a reference-based utility (which may be encouraged with segregation)
 does seem to permit an equilibrium where only the poor are concerned with
 status games (with respect to skills-enhancement), the result only suggests
 that a segregation of status games along with that of incomes is another
 possible long-term outcome of limited participation.

\begin_layout Standard
We have considered a model where status amounts to a position that only
 temporarily cements the participant's economic position.
 With a decision theory framework for uncertainty, the goal of the model
 has been to investigate role of income difference on expenditures that
 carry some status while also having some effect on the income mobility
 of the participants.
 The endogenisation of status in this manner allows us to use the framework
 to understand the role of income difference under urbanisation across economies
 with wide-differences in status-determining cultural notions as well as
 development indicators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foremost result from the model is that under diminishing utility from
 wealth, the only two stable equilibria are those where both rich and poor
 participate in status competitions and those where only rich stand to benefit
 from status competitions.
 The model allows us to understand how a withdrawal from expenditure such
 as education in certain developing economies could be result of a combined
 effect of both participation costs and income-differences.
 More specifically, high participation costs push the equilibrium to one
 where where only rich participate in status-related competitions whereas
 high income differences may have the unlikely effect of incentivising the
 poor consumers to participate.
 In the context of developing economies, lowering of participation costs
 in education (as a status game) despite rise in income differences may
 thus also represent a likely escape from segregation of participation in
 the near-term for many developing economies.
 The role of a reference-based utility add an important caveat to these
 results since contentment at lower levels of wealth could support segregation
 of competitions at different income levels in the economy.

% The main idea is to calculate the total probability over r_{i}.
 One objection that can be raised is that the total probability must be
 calculated in one big integration rather than first calculating probability
 for given r_{i},s_{i} and then letting r_{i} and s_{i} vary independently.
 But this objection can be addressed by considering the sample space of
 r_{i}.
 It seems valid to consider the conditional probability of winning by considerin
g all the possibilities for other player(s).
 As long as r_{i} , s_{i} are being varied for one participant alone, the
 integration seems the right thing to do.
