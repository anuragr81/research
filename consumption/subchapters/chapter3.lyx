\begin_layout Abstract
Status motivations for consumption have generated an immense interest in
 the developed economies at a time when social mobility has been relatively
 stagnant.
 Considering a setting where income inequalities are stronger and status
 rewards may comprise of simple improvements in wealth - we focus on a status
 game in the developing economies that provides future economic gain to
 the consumer.
 Viewing status as an expected future wealth in the game where consumers
 invest for status and transition through fixed bands corresponding to varied
 incomes , we examine the effect of rise in income inequalities on status
 consumption - finding that the stability of population in bands alone may
 be enough to limit status consumption in the long-term.

% Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 This is particularly important since the consumer's social need for status
 items is hardly as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.
 With social needs determined by the consumer's interaction with others
 in the economy, the demand for status items necessarily depends on social
 participation and exclusion.

% 1.1.2 The classical literature emphasized the channels through which inequality
 can promote growth by fostering incentives for innovation and entrepreneurship
 (Lazear and Rosen 1981) raising saving and investment if rich people save
 a higher fraction of their income (Kaldor 1957) and allowing at least a
 few individuals to accumulate the minimum needed to start businesses and
 get a good education (Barro 2000).
 In contrast, more recent work has stressed that inequality may be harmful
 for growth.

 Some studies have found a significant and negative effect of inequality
 on growth and its duration (Ostry and Berg, 2011; Ostry et al., 2014; Cingano,
 2014).
 Others have found no systematic negative effect of inequality on growth
 (Forbes, 2000; Panizza, 2002; Kraay, 2015).
 Barro (2000) and Halter et al.
 (2014) report that the growth-inequality relationship is sensitive to,
 respectively, the income level of the country, and the time horizon under
 consideration.
 And some authors have sought to show that the relationship is non-linear
 (Banerjee and Duflo, 2003; Brueckner et al., 2015).

 A number of studies exploit the variability of U.S.

 the future income growth of the poor and positively that of the rich (Marrero
 and Rodr√≠guez, 2013; Hsieh et al., 2013; Bradbury and Triest, 2016; Marrero
 et al., 2016).
 The rationale is that inequality of opportunity may harm economic growth
 because it hinders human capital accumulation by low-income individuals.

 Inequality is said to promote growth by fostering aggregate saving (Kuznets
 1955l Kaldor 1955) by promoting the realization of high-return projects
 (Rosenzweig and Binswanger 1993); or by stimulating R&D (Foellmi and Zweimuller
 2006).
 On the other hand, inequality is expected to hamper growth by promoting
 expensive fiscal policies (Perotti 1993, Alesina and Rodrik 1994, Persson
 and Tabellini 1994) by inducing an inefficient state bureaucracy (Acemoglu
 et al 2011) by hampering human capital formation (Galor and Zeira 1993,
 Galor and Moav 2004) by leading to political instability (Benabou 1996);
 or by undermining the legal system (Glaeser et al 2003).
 Most of the positive effects (e.g.
 those operating through convex saving functions, market imperfections or
 incentives for innovation) rely on purely economic mechanisms.
 It is therefore plausible to assume that they materialize in the short
 term.
 Most of the negative effects, however, involve the political process, the
 change of institutions, the rise of sociopolitical movements or they operate
 through changes in the educational attainment of the population.
 Thus, arguably, these effects materialize only with a considerable lag.

 (Quoted from Bradbury): Once they decompose total inequality into components
 associated with opportunity and effort, the authors expect inequality of
 opportunity to exert a negative influence on growth and inequality of effort
 to add positively to growth.
 Measured inequality of opportunity is likely to reflect factors that are
 associated with reduced growth, such as market imperfections that lead
 to too little investment in the human capital of low-circumstance children.
 The association between measured inequality of effort and growth is less
 clear.
 Measured inequality of effort will partly reflect the incentives to work
 hard and take risks, which will be positively correlated with economic
 activity.
 However, because it is a residual category, it will also reflect unmeasured
 aspects of inequality of opportunity (circumstances), the effects of institutio
ns etc, so its overall correlation with economic activity is not clear.

 Kuznets 1955 (as quoted in BradburyTriestInequalityofOpportunityAggEconPerf2016
)- argued that inequality tends to rise in a country's early stages of economic
 development and observed that it then appears to stabilize and decline
 as developed nations' economies continue to grow and mature (giving rise
 to what is now known as the Kuznets curve).
 Kuznets discussed two major factors involved in the evolution of incomes
 in developed nations-the cumulative effects of a concentration of savings
 among high earners and the industrial shift from agriculture to industrial
 urban settings - both of which would lead to continued widening of the
 income distribu- tion.
 However, finding no such widening - indeed documenting declines in inequality
 in the United States and United Kingdom from the 1920s through 1950 - he
 argued that the inequality- worsening factors were counteracted by other
 forces embodied in 'the dynamism of a growing and free economic society'.
 Among the factors Kuznets cited as contributing to reduced income inequality
 as growth progresses is the greater ability of people born into an urban
 industrial economy to

 - relative to those who migrated from rural agricultural areas, suggesting

 The inequality in opportunity literature suggests that the underlying causal
 mechanism for inequality of opportunity to influence growth is that inequality
 of opportunity prevents some potential workers or entrepreneurs in the
 economy from developing their full capacity, generating wasted resources
 and hence lower-than-possible output.
 As discussed, for example, the inefficiencies represented by unequal access
 to education constitute a drag on growth.

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer response to relative income has appealed to economists since
 at least as far back as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 While the post-war period of relative stability and life-style improvements
 have renewed an interest in the positional concerns (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond,HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), there remains a disconnect between the descriptive theories - which explain
 the effects of a consumer's social context on her choices - and the theories
 of long-term economic growth (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KayRadicalUncertainty2020,SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Status competitions have been argued to be ubiquitous - but the empirical
 explorations of how the microeconomic behaviour of a status-seeking consumer
 could relate with the economic growth or inequality in the developing economies
 are rare (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KnellInequalityStatusGrowth1999,HopkinsStatusInequalityGrowth2004,CorneoStatusGrowth2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for theoretical arguments).
 To assist such analyses, the presented chapter addresses two questions
 pertaining to inequality and growth in the context of status comeptitions.
 First, we answer if status consumption - treated as investments towards
 future probable success - should increase or decrease with a rise in income
 inequality or not.
 Second, we clarify if income inequality may discourage risk-taking and
 contribute to growth through status competitions in the long-term.
 In addressing these questions, we focus on status games that provide a
 positive externality or direct gains to the consumer in a developing economy
 - while treating the uncertainty in intergenerational or spatial mobility
 explicitly as probabilistic rewards from investments towards status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stylised model of a status game with gains that are constrained with
 the long-term stability of consumer populations - pursues a contest-theory
 approach (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) while also bearing similarity with the model proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"

\end_inset

 where status is viewed as a ranking device for non-transactional environments
 directly influencing the consumer income.
 Equating the status goals of the consumer with her economic goals, the
 current approach views status as the expected secure wealth maximised by
 the consumer.
 It then treats status consumption as the expenditure or cost to participate
 in a tiered rewards game.
 While the approach may be of limited value in discussions where status
 consumption is treated as necessarily futile, the view of status consumption
 as investments towards material status is more relevant for growing economies
 that provide new opportunities to gain wealth amidst an environment of
 severe income inequalities.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even with this narrowed scope of status consumption, the existing debates
 surrounding the two questions that we address in the current chapter seem
 to offer little clarity on the relationship of status consumption with
 inequality and growth.
 A contradiction seems to persist for the first question since there are
 contrasting views in the literature on whether inequality has a negative
 or positive effect on status consumption.
 The post-war literature on status competitions argues that a fall in income
 inequalities and improvement in life-standards has resulted in a higher
 focus on status goods (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithAffluent,GalbraithBeyondContentment1994,GalbraithEssential"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) while the empirical literature more often finds that status consumption
 increases with rising inequality.
 It is worth emphasising that the sociological observations of increased
 status needs in response to falling inequality in the post-war era are
 associated with normative rather than descriptive concerns.
 Therefore, it need not follow from these observations that consumers feel
 a higher need for status as the inequality rises (or vice versa) - only
 that the avenues for indicating status may decline as the life-standards
 become uniform with decrease in income inequality (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HarrodGrowth1958,HirschSocialLimits"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When equipped with subjective welfare data, the recent empirical analyses
 on how status competitions could relate to observed income inequality have
 instead found a positive effect of income inequality on status consumption.
 In other words, it is more often - particularly in the developing world
 - that status consumption increases with rising inequality.
 In a study focusing on education expenses for status purposes in China,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JinLiInequalityStatusConsumption2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find, for example, that higher inequality increases the consumption towards
 status.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 also report that consumers in India have increased conspicuous consumption
 with rise in inequality.
 An appropriate line of research has been to examine the environment where
 inequality is experienced (often relying on social attitudes surveys).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MijsInequalityMobility2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, for example, use the data from International Social Survey to detail how
 a rise in inequality might have cemented a belief in meritocracy in the
 developed economies and coincided with segregation rather than a healthy
 competition.
 A causal relationship between inequality and status consumption remain
 elusive since the growth environment as well as social context of an economy
 create an evident omitted variable bias for empirical studies.
 Thus the demands for status could be different in a rising economy than
 in a stagnant economy or vary within the same country due to significant
 income-segregation (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011,MinkoffLyonsIncomePerceptionsUnderIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since status competitions are tied with particular social contexts, an
 econometric analysis must deal with the environment where inequality is
 experienced.
 The effect of income opportunities and resource-constraints on status competiti
ons is thus an important consideration for the current chapter.

 of economic development before declining as its economy matures (industrialises

 However, later empirical works have argued for both positive and negative
 effects of inequality on growth.
 Those who argue for a positive effect of inequality on growth emphasise
 how inequality helps innovation (

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike in the literature on visible consumption, the status competitions
 in this stylised model are neither wasteful nor free of the necessary limitatio
ns of a macroeconomy.
 The long-term income inequalities are permanent in the model (as is often
 the case in developing economies) but the consumers are allowed to transition
 through income bands through investments towards status (economic) gain
 with a certain probability.
 The probabilistic transition implies both a promotion and demotion of a
 consumer to the higher and lower income-bands in the economy.
 The set up relies on the observation first made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HarrodGrowth1958"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that social mobility and status are constrained due to necessarily limited
 positions for high status.
 With the consumer needs fixed for a given income-band, a consumer obtains
 a fixed disposable income by merely belonging to the income band (at a
 a given time) and the only sense of status in the economy is derived from
 the expected accumulated wealth at a certain risk over the long term.
 The status competitions in every income band provide an uncertain transition
 to a richer income band (except for the richest band) - a transition whose
 probability is increased by higher expenditure towards status.
 Similarly, the probability of demotion to a lower income band is reduced
 with a higher expenditure towards status.
 While status competitions are ubiquitous in the model through participation
 of all consumers (a representative consumer in each band), the status competiti
ons are constrained by the transition functions that limit high status to
 a small section of society.
 Any status is achieved in the process of the consumer's maximisation of
 the consumer's projected assets-accumulation using the incomes received
 from the variety of income strata she may belong to in the future (due
 to transitions through the income bands).

The solution of the dynamic equilibrium implied by the above model relies
 on two conditions.
 First is the condition of population stability i.e.
 the long-term stability of sub-populations within these bands that ensures
 the number of consumers leaving a band being balanced with the number entering
 the band.
 The second condition is the ordering of utilities for richer and poorer
 consumer in a society.
 Since the recurrent bands in the model are the poorest and the richest
 bands, a particular ordering of how rich and poor consumers benefit from
 their respective utilities from accumulated wealth is assumed for two bands
 in the economy.
 In the long-term equilibrium under these conditions, a consumer balances
 the accumulation of her wealth at risk with maintenance of a fair chance
 to improve (or hold) her socio-economic position.
 In the simplified consideration of two-income bands, we then discuss the
 implications rising income equality on the steady state levels of status
 consumption and long-term asset accumulations.
 While the game does permit a zero investment by either of the consumers
 i.e.
 a complete withdrawal from the status competition, a non-zero consumption
 for both the consumers means that the rich consumer must not find the promotion
 investment - which the poorer consumer is offered a chance to be rich with
 - to be too little and the poorer consumer must not find that there is
 nothing on offer for mobility through status competitions to the richer
 position.

One of the implications of the two long-term equilibrium conditions - i.e.
 the conditions of band population stability and the ordering of rich and
 poor asset utilities - is that the expenditure towards status for the poorer
 consumer need not decline with narrowing of income differences in the long-term.
 Equivalently, the costs to maintain the high wealth for the richer consumer
 may rise with narrowing of income differences in the long-term.
 These implications are different from those in a short-term competition
 when wider income differences (rise in inequality) always intensify status
 competitions (i.e.
 increase the expenditure towards status).
 These provide a key insight for the first question we're interested in.
 While wider income differences (rise in inequality) tend to intensify status
 competitions and should increase the expenditure towards status in the
 short-term (as is validated by empirical assessments discussed above),
 the long-term equilibrium conditions of population stability imply a different
 dynamics where the wider income differences may act to reduce expenditure
 towards status by making band-promotion more difficult (for the poor consumers)
 and band-security cheaper (for the richer consumers).
 Similarly, a narrowing of income-differences in the long-term increases
 the value of (utility from) the expenditure towards status for poorer consumers
 - so that the poorer consumers spend less on status investments while the
 richer consumers raise their expenditure towards status to maintain their
 position of wealth in the long-term.
 Inequality can thus have a separating effect of pushing status-related
 investments away from each other in the long-term so that it discourages
 investments towards status in the stylised model.

\begin_layout Standard
Interpreting growth as the net accumulations for the consumers in the steady
 state, we also show that growth can either decline or rise with rise inequality
 depending on the transition functions - so long as the population stability
 criterion is implied.
 In other words, a consumer may strive for more mobility in the short-term
 as income differences rise, but if the long-equilibrium were to move from
 a low-income differences (income inequality) setting to a higher income-differe
nces setting, it is possible that poor consumer completely withdraws from
 the status competitions (zero status consumption).
 The net effect of inequality on growth is thus determined by how the combined
 asset accumulation for the rich and the poor rise or fall with inequality
 in the long-term equilibrium.
 This also means that inequality could rise while maintaining the same steady-st
ate growth in the model - so that a decline in poor's investments towards
 status are compensated by the rise in rich consumer's investments towards
 status.
 If one may view the demotion in the model as equivalent of a redistribution
 mechanism, the particular results are similar to those arrived at by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 using a prisoner's dilemma formulation with possible expropriation of a
 common pool of assets.
 In other words, the long-term equilbrium results suggest that inequality
 may increase redistribution through rise in investments for status.

We believe that the contest-theory approach used in the chapter is more
 general and better suited for examining the effect of inequality on expenditure
s such as education - which are not strictly wasteful in a developing economy
 and provide a real, albeit uncertain, opportunity for gain in positional
 or economic improvement.
 As social customs typically lag behind the rapid economic changes experienced
 in many such developing economies, the long-term income inequalities can
 be assumed to be as stable as the status competitions that represent institutio
nal structures which maintain social hierarchies.
 Under these settings, not only can one assume a positive externality from
 status games (

e (

 We thus avoid a utility based on wasteful consumption (

 Other than the appropriateness of status games for expenses such as education,
 there are two further advantages of the explicit treatment of uncertainty
 in status gains in the contest-theory approach we follow in the current
 chapter.
 First, fewer assumptions are needed on savings behaviour of the consumer
 (such as a constant savings rate) and the steady state of growth (such
 as a knowledge spill-over assumption in

) - given that we directly factor in the constraints of population stability
 in income bands.
 Second, the model can lead to empirical insights for economies where the
 income disparities are more readily observed than the reference consumption
 levels.

The results from the model contribute to the literature in many different
 ways.
 First, the framework with uncertainty in consumer choice proposed in the
 chapter may be better suited for incorporating choices that affect intergenerat
ional or spatial mobility that in turn correspond to material gain from
 status competitions.
 Second, the model addresses status-related investments in education or
 professional club memberships that are often ignored in the discussion
 of status consumption due to positive externalities associated with the
 investments.
 Third, it establishes that the steady state conditions for composition
 of populations in income-bands are enough to reverse the appeal for investment
 towards status.
 The findings from the chapter have a fundamental implication for policy
 - that while income inequality may motivate the consumer in the short-run,
 the long-term equilibrium must resort to securities for the consumers.

 stability (through perceptions of fairness in competitions) in an economy
 where processes of inheritance widen the differences in accumulated wealth,
 the conditions for long-term stability may reverse the implications of
 the widening of income differences on status competitions that are implied
 in the short-term.

 The current chapter focuses on how the uncertainty in a transition to bands
 of disparate income - encapsulating the effects of social structures -
 could influence the investments towards status.
 More specifically, the notion of uncertainty in the model encompasses the
 indeterminate processes of promotion to social positions that directly
 influence the income towards accumulations.
 The formulation of status competitions as a game for long-term asset accumulati
ons under uncertain transitions within finite income bands - constitutes
 a contest theory approach similar to that in the sequential game explored

They are a few key differences between our contest-theory approach and the
 Tullock competition.
 While the status game - much like a Tullock competition - is a full information
 game, the approach in the current chapter is more concerned with the implicatio
ns of a long-term equilibrium than the sequential setting that is at the
 heart of a Tullock contest.
 Further, instead of operating as Tullock's bidding competition, our model
 uses a logistic probability function for transition across income bands
 that is constrained by population stability of income bands and a particular
 ordering of asset utilities for consumers in income bands.
 The probability function used in the model is thus different from that
 in the Tullock contest - which has a unique probability function necessitated
 by its setting (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kooremanTullockProbability1997"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Also, since the number of players is fixed in the long-term equilibrium
 due to the population stability condition, the issue of multiple players
 does not arise in our simultaneous formulation either.
 Finally, in contrast with the discussions of the short-term (symmetric)
 Nash equilibria for Tullock rent-seeking games with a discrete strategy(see

LatexCommand cite
key "BayeKovenockTullockCompetition_r_gt_2_1994,BayeKovenockAllpayAuction1996"

 an equilibrium where no participating consumers see any net benefit in
 the long-term from changing her effort i.e.
 the level of expenditure towards status acquisition.

It is worth highlighting that the conditions on the feasibility of transition
 probability also address the issue of dissipation - the total invested
 resources in the rent-seeking game being less than the total rents - which
 is an issue that is not considered in the original Tullock contest.
 More specifically, the original Tullock competition does not consider that
 the total rent would be lower than the total resources invested in rent-seeking
 (

 More particularly, the visible consumption studies consider a utility from

 improve their future wealth.

 The consumer could also be demoted to an immediate lower income band

\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the lowest band 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected utility from the future assets in the respective
 income bands she may be in the future.
 The incomes are distinguished based solely upon rewards of status competitions
 i.e.
 the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1...n}$
\end_inset

 that are provided in the respective income band (the disposable income
 excludes the cost of a consumer's needs and is the same for all consumers
 in a particular asset-band).
 We summarise the assumption as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:def_band"

\end_inset

The incomes bands are characterised only by the levels of disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every consumer strives to achieve the highest assets in the economy.
 Since the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every band can be used to accumulate towards assets under risk of loss
 or participate in tournaments of unobserved ability, the wealth differences
 among consumers in this economy arise only due to their performance in
 status competitions.
 The status competitions are meant to arise due to institutional arrangements
 that grant some mobility across income bands while not completely getting
 rid of the stratification that prevents more participation.
 In other words, the success in status competitions serves both as an evidence
 of ability and as a barrier to entry for those with less proven abilities.
 The ability pertinent to one's status may thus be innate, unobserved and
 responsible for success in the status competitions, but it is relevant
 only through probabilistic monetary success in the long-term and is revealed
 to the consumer only through status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in income across bands makes the the competition biased
 in favour of the high spender, so that more expenditure towards status
 increases the probability of one's successes in the status competitions
 through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and decreases that of failure 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is defined so that a consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is rewarded more often and so that no amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can ever provide guarantee to be in the next band (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also assume that the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 have the same structure across income bands i.e.
 their dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "assu:natural_competition"

\end_inset

The mechanism for the competitions are fundamentally the same across all
 bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lower band (e.g.
 a poorer underlcass in an economy or a poorer country in the global economy)
 may thus have a lower base-level expenditure towards status (e.g.
 mean) but the outperformers in a poor environment are expected to improve
 their fortunes through the same mechanism that a consumer in a higher-income
 band would.
 This is a fundamental assumption for the status competitions in the model
 that determines the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising again that the consumers of varying characteristics
 (age, skills, talent etc.) observe the same likelihood of promotion to the
 next band as long as they are in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 for band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 offer exactly the same probability to all the consumers in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Further, since the status competitions in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 to be promoted to band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are not open to any consumers in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that is lower than the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

, it follows that for a consumer to be in a band higher than the next she
 must go through the next band.
 A consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can reach to another band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 only by going through bands 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1,...,j-1$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, a Markovian property is implied for the consumer's future
 utility from assets.
 In other words, status is the expected future utility at any point that
 the consumers maximise with the income received in their income band by
 either staying in the same band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or having moved to any of the bands different from their own.
 This scheme of transitions implied by this property in an economy of 
\begin_inset Formula $1...n$
\end_inset

 bands is shown in Figure

 her final assets and that the disposable income differences don't directly
 influence her choice except through status investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 - which in turn determines the future expected value of assets.

The above set up for status competitions implies a short-term Nash equilibrium
 as consumers maximise the total accumulated assets in their band-reference
 within a given (finite) period of time.
 While the assets to be maximised are may be at risk of loss in the long-term,
 the short-term optimisation must be unaware of the assets being lost in
 the short-term finite horizon.
 For the discussion of the short-term equilibrium, therefore, we use an
 economy of two bands represented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Without loss of generality, we consider the equilibrium when the consumers
 in the economy comprising of a poor band 1 and a rich band 2 maximise the
 assets accumulated in a single (finite) period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice first that the consumer in the two-band economy can either be demoted
 or promoted over time and her expected future wealth would be the expected
 sum of incomes from the future bands she can be in over the finite time-horizon.
 In the Markov chain implied in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the future state of the consumer is thus based on either of the future
 bands she could be in with the respective probabilities associated with
 the transition i.e.
 the consumer in band 1 could expect to have either 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 income in the next period with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $1-W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 In the period after next, she could be in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{2}$

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{2}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and so in further periods.
 Similarly, the consumer in band 2 could be in band 1 or 2 in the next period
 with the respective probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and so on.

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the optimisation of expected utility over a (finite) two-periods,
 the representative consumer in the two-bands economy has - as it were -
 just one life and the one-shot-investment for her life-time status as she
 maximises the utility from assets under no risk.
 The probability functions associated with the promotion and demotion 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 respectively are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In the short-term finite horizon equilibrium, the representative consumer
 must maximise the assets at the end of the first-time horizon.
 It being a finite time-horizon, the consumer is not expected to spend on
 expenditure towards status at the end of her life.
 Thus, as is common in the applications of the life-cycle model (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the finite-time horizon optimisation means that the consumer isn't concerned
 with the life after the time-horizon.
 In other words, the short-term equilibrium requires that the consumer does
 not worry about her poorer or richer future state expect for the final
 assets at the end of time finite time-horizon.
 We thus set the expenditure towards status 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the last period as zero for all the consumers regardless of the value
 of assets they have amassed.

As such the short-term finite horizon equilibrium expects that narrowing
 income differences would decrease the expenditure towards status .
 However there is a serious limitation to our interpretations from the short-ter
m equilibrium due the assumption of exogenous

\end_inset

 in the above model.
 A change 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\equiv y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 (across the section or over time) in the long-term would evidently change
 the status competitions themselves, so that a new set of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}^{T'}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k+1}^{T'}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 For us to derive conclusions for the long-term equilibrium, we consider
 long-term stability of asset differences so as to infer the dependence

% The promotion in income bands does not assume an existing distribution
 of success-determining qualities for the consumer.
 Unlike with the approach adopted by [#HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004],
 W(
\backslash
nu) and L(
\backslash
nu) solely determine the distribution of success or accumulation of assets
 in the economy.
 Therefore the past success in status competitions is the only relevant
 determinant of success and the consumer identity.
 It can be argued that with institutions as the occupational or marriage
 markets, the consumers know about their abilities only through participation
 (through expenditures in education[#KonradStrategyDynamicsContests] or
 social activities) where their past success as well as starting wealth
 determine their future decisions of 
\backslash
nu.
 This is similar to the matching process described in [#ColeMaliathSocialNorms19

For the purposes of our discussion on long-term conditions, we continue
 to use the simplified chain with only two income bands which the consumers
 can transition in between.
 The simplification - shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ReducedChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 - can be easily extended to higher bands (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FullChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and does not change the core of our arguments.
 The fundamental condition for long-term stability that we impose is that
 of the stability of income band populations.
 More specifically, the number of consumers who leave an income band in
 the long-run must be balanced by those entering the income band in the
 long-term.
 The essential claim that is inherent is that the consumers expectations
 are not detached from the population constraint.
 An equilibrium with long-term income inequalities thus cannot exist if
 not for such a population preserving status competition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long-term status competitions with a population preserving mechanism
 - are equivalent to a scheme where an equal number of consumers are selected
 in successive bands and swapped with each other at a certain cost (see
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:WinnersandlosersChainExchange"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 With such a swapping mechanism, if 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$

 represents the probability of a consumer moving from band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$

 (not defined for

It is worth emphasising that the long-term income inequalities without any
 redistribution (or a status competition defined as above) cannot provide
 a stable long-term equilibrium for asset values.
 More specifically, if we rule out any institutions of direct redistribution
 of income, the accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=\sum_{t}^{T}\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the disposable income for the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}=y_{i}\forall t$
\end_inset

 ) - would lead to divergent differences in accumulated wealth - unless
 there is a risk of loss associated with the accumulation of wealth so that
 accumulations remain bounded.
 While it may seem plausible that an equilibrium of assets under no risk
 but with different disposable incomes may arrive as long as the consumers
 can move across bands often enough through status competitions, it can
 be shown that no redistribution or status competition can allow for a long-term
 equilibrium of asset values in the above economy with unequal incomes (see
 Appendix II).
 Since the redistribution implied through the random swap (i.e.
 transition in the long-term where assets are carried over with the consumer
 ) cannot lead to a steady state, one can say status competitions under
 no risk of loss to assets can never be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a long-term equilibrium.
 The only exception is when there are no net gains at from expenditure towards
 status at all for either of the consumers i.e.
 status consumption is completely futile for asset gain purposes.
 When assets accumulated are under risk (for both rich and poor consumers),
 however, a stable steady state is easily achieved.

For details of the long-term equilibrium, we make another assumption stating
 that the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$

 the horizon considered for loss of accumulated assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
The

The above assumption allows us to consider an independent stochastic variable
 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$

 for both the consumers.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}=1$

 being observed by both the consumers independently implies that the above
 set up also allows us to ignore the role of starting assets consider

\end_inset

 for both the consumers in the long-term.
 The consumer accumulations are expected to be reset at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=T$
\end_inset

 and the consumer thus minimises her accumulation at the time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

.
 However, given that assets are to be maximised in the longer-term, the
 consumer must also strike a balance between i) taking a fair chance to
 be in the richer band and ii) accumulating as high assets as possible towards
 the expected reset-frequency

The above long-term conditions imply that a higher

 makes the loss to a lower band more acceptable for the consumer in band
 2.
 Peer effects kick in due to the fact that the richer consumer absorbs (replicat

 thus the choice of the poorer band is also factored into her choice in
 the starting period.
 Similarly, a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$

 might make staying in the poorer band more appealing for the consumer 1.
 With asset accumulations under risk, the competitions therefore do allow
 the consumers to share their risky assets in the long-term.

The condition of population stability (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) constraints the selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 More specifically, the conditions implies the following in a two-band economy,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
W_{1}(\bar{\nu}_{1})=L_{2}(\bar{\nu}_{2})

\begin_layout Standard
The above relation between the selection 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 made by the consumer in the long-term (for the two-band economy) helps
 us define the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\cdot),\psi(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}=\psi(\bar{\nu}_{2})=W^{-1}(L(\bar{\nu}_{2}))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}=\phi(\bar{\nu}_{1})=L^{-1}(W(\bar{\nu}_{1}))$
\end_inset

.
 This also means that the utilities 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 maximised by the consumer can be written in term of either 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This is akin to the consumer 1 ( or consumer 2 ) optimising her utility
 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$

 properties of particular forms of

 These particular forms - along the utility

 the risks shared between the bands as the income difference increases or
 decreases in a long-term equilibrium.

% Discontinuity: Before reset the the consumer accumulates and after the
 reset her asset disappears.
 The combined utility is maximised the final expected assets and the consumer
 cannot maximise at t=1 without considering what happens after (e.g.
 another consumer comes, L,W change etc.).
 Further, since the choice at t=1 is different from choice at t=0 if considering
 the next period alone, a single nu for two time periods can only be forced.
  The total assets which we consider are different in the current assets
 where the decision is being made.
 The same asset can be enjoyed more in the poorer band and that matters
 only when utilities are considered i.e.
 after summing them up over time.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% Discarding intertemporal substitution - The solution with intertemporal
 utility has the advantage that it provides a control for whether consumers
 care more about the long-term transition or the the accumulation.
 Long-term movements are not influenced by savings at all (all savings are
 meant to go to waste in the long run).
 This also allows us to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approximate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the case with general  with a discount-factor.
 The intertemporal methods does however go against the central argument
 that consumers maximise long-term accumulations.
 We are left with no options but to rely on the same nu for both periods
 in order to explain the substitution between later and earlier risk.

The selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 rests upon two properties that we have briefly discussed.
 First, the status competitions can never guarantee a reward to the next
 band i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $\nexists\nu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)\ne1$
\end_inset

.
 Second, that any consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 should be rewarded with a higher probability than a consumer with a lower
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\nu_{1}>\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{1})>W(\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu_{1})<L(\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\nu_{1}>\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

The above specification only considers 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial W}{\partial\nu}$
\end_inset

 is symmetrical around 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the probability to rise to the next band rises and drops at the same rate
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 The same applies to the equivalent definition for 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 When considering the population stability in band, the above specification
 translates into a simple linear relationship between the parameters that
 we discuss below.
 While a 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial W}{\partial\nu}$
\end_inset

 that is asymmetrical around 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 may provide a more general specification of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

, the results that we derive from the specification are independent of whether
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial W}{\partial\nu}$

 is symmetrical around 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 around or not.

\begin_layout Standard
The implications of the parameters for the nature of status competitions
 are now explained.
 First, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 determines how sharp the probability of promotion 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 would rise with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 The plots of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:W_nu_parameters"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

, on the other hand, represents whether a significant rise in probability
 occurs for a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

) or relatively low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

).
 Roughly speaking, with 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 being the upward mobility in the two-consumer economy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is the degree of separation in bands imposed by the spending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 A high 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 differentiates the outcome of those having low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from those having higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 more clearly.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 - on the other hand - is the minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for there to be a material probability of transition to the next income
 band.
 It thus represents the level of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 at which status competitions become significant in the economy.
 We focus on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

 implied by long-term equilibria - since a high 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

 means a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 required for mobility and a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

 means low mobility.

% [fixing 
\backslash
omega, 
\backslash
lambda] When income differences are low, the consumers would spend more
 on status consumption - because there is some difference in asset still.
 But we expect competition to narrow - that could mean either or both of
 i) a sharp response to 
\backslash
nu i.e.
 high 
\backslash
omega or ii) a higher 
\backslash
bar{
\backslash
omega} so that there are no gains until a certain level is reached.
 Again magnitude of 
\backslash
omega does not seem to matter in our story - as it only seems to suggest
 a discreteness in competition i.e.
 whether the consumer below a certain threshold get no benefit at all.
 We do however see curvature effect on 
\backslash
omega - so setting 
\backslash
kappa
\backslash
ne1 seems one way to get a curvature to the poorer consumer - increasing
 lambda_bar also adds curvature to consumer 1 i.e.
 requiring a high

Another way to interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*}=\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}-\kappa(\nu_{2}^{*}-\underbar{\ensuremath{\lambda}})$
\end_inset

 is that the poorer consumer's long-term expenditure towards status rises
 with the level at which upward transition becomes significant and falls
 with richer consumer's excessive spending.
 That the level at which upward transition becomes significant raises poor
 consumer's expenditure towards status is not surprising - but the more
 interesting implication from the population constraint is the withdrawal
 of the poorer consumer from the status competition due to a higher status
 investment (consumption) by the richer consumer.

Since we focus on growing economies where one would see status competitions
 determining promotion more sharply than demotion - we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>\lambda$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa>1$
\end_inset

 for the rest of our discussion.
 In other words, the assumption of

 only underpins a relatively more significant make-or-break situation for
 the poorer consumers.

Within such an environment, the population constraint readily provides the
 condition of withdrawal from status competitions for either of the consumers
 in the economy.
 More particularly, there would be no benefits to the consumer from expenditure
 towards status when either 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 is implied in the long-term.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are known in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 are already known and fixed) for given utilities, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}{\kappa}+\overline{\lambda}=\overline{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 allows us to obtain promotion level 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 for a given level of security 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 that must exist for there to be a feasible status competition.
 In other words, for consumer 1 to participate in the status competition,
 the consumer 2 must choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}<\frac{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}{\kappa}+\overline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 .
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$

 implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\kappa\underline{\lambda}+\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 if the consumer 1 spends more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa\underline{\lambda}+\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

, the likelihood of her getting into the richer band is so high relative
 to the security offered to the consumer 2 through status competition that
 there would be no reason for any expenditure towards status for the richer
 consumer.

With fixed values of

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.) that helps determine the remaining parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 .
 This condition is arrived at by viewing the selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1},\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 as a multi-objective optimisation so that an optimal pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\bar{\nu}_{1},\bar{\nu}_{2}\}$
\end_inset

 is selected for the society comprising of two bands.
 Thus, the values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 are implied by both the population stability condition and the criterion
 for maximal consumer utilities.
 The parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 - defined as the level of expenditure towards status at which promotion
 or demotion in the bands is of material significance - can thus be eliminated
 after fixing 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 using i) the population stability condition and ii) the conditions for
 an optimal combined utility for the two consumers.

\begin_layout Standard
Since we wish to explain the sensitivity of status consumption with respect
 to income difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

, we let 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 be eliminated - without a loss of generality - by using the population
 stability condition.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the maximal combined utility for the two consumers.
 This combined utility for the two consumers can be viewed as the Pareto-goal
 for the society comprising of rich and the poor consumers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now introduce a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 which controls whether the Pareto goal relies more on the richer consumer
 than the poorer consumer.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 thus represents on how labour-intensive an economy may be or how segregated
 (in terms of the population) the rich and the poor are in the economy.
 What matters for our discussion is that any given long-term income difference
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 when a particular structure of the combined utility is known.
 Defining a general form of the combined (concave) utility - which is maximised
 collectively for the two consumer in the two bands - with parameter

 consumer, we have

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\mathscr{U}}{\partial\underline{\lambda}}=0$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 after 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$

 is eliminated using the population stability condition (see below for details).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case I, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}+\bar{\nu}_{2}=\xi$

\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 would increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Finiteness constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}^{*}+\bar{\nu}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 therefore suppress the status consumption for the poorer consumer.
 Further, long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is an increasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 increasing income difference between the two consumers always increases
 the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

\begin_inset Formula $\omega>\lambda$
\end_inset

 would mean that an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$

 would decrease 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and a decrease in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 would increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$

 of local-maximisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},u_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},u_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\nu),\psi(\nu)$
\end_inset

 - whose specific forms have not been yet assumed.
 Considering a specific form for 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\Gamma\cdot A^{\alpha-1}$
\end_inset

 and the population stability condition (see Appendix III), the three unknowns
 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega},\underline{\lambda}$

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial\bar{\nu}_{1}}=0$

\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 So long as the form of

\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$

The effects of income difference 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 on status competitions can thus be explored while incorporating the changes
 in competitions that are caused by income-differences in the long-term.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 endogenised within the equilibrium conditions, we are able to remedy the
 earlier issue with the short-term equilibrium that changes in income also
 change the competitions and 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu),L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 themselves.
 Unlike with the short-term equilibrium, in other words, the changes in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 correspond to a different 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 characterised by 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 This relationship does not necessarily result in consumers increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in response to income differences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A caveat to these results is the form of a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the Pareto concern of how the asset utilities from poor and richer consumer
 are combined in a society.
 A simple setting is one where both consumers being better off (with higher
 utilities from assets) aligns with the maximisation of the combined utility.
 We explore this particular setting numerically in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The implications for the effect of income differences may be a lot different
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$

 were to favour the richer or poorer consumer.
 While we don't concern ourselves with the effect of different regimes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}$

 in the current chapter, a simple setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}(u_{1},u_{2})=\beta u_{1}+(1-\beta)u_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$

 as well as the asset accumulations

 using the utility

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{U}(u_{1},u_{2})=\beta u_{1}+(1-\beta)u_{2}$

 We observe that a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 does cause the poorer consumer to withdraw from the competition so that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

 Similarly, a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 causes the richer consumer to withdraw from the status competition so that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 More particularly, lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 creates the incentive for the consumer 1 to participate in the status consumpti
on and a given range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 makes it worthwhile for both the consumers to have non-zero status consumption
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

).
 However, an extremely low 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

 makes the promotion extremely easy and causes the consumer 2 to withdraw
 i.e.
 reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 This is because the richer consumer would no longer be concerned with demotion
 if the opportunities to rise to the richer position are plenty.
 That an extremely high 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 causes the (poorer) consumer 1 to withdraw is a more obvious implication
 due to the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}<y_{1}$

It is also evident that a widening of income differences - so long as it

 significantly, would result in a higher expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 from consumer 1 if the consumer 2 withdraws from the competition.
 This is because the benefits from higher investments into status are higher
 if the other consumer does not participate.

 As the figure shows, the very low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 only make the status competition lucrative for the poorer consumer.
 However, there is only a certain level of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\equiv y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

until which high income differences encourage only consumer 1 to increase
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 - a level after which both consumers participate so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}>0$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 rises by as much that the poorer consumer is no longer able to afford raising
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 , the optimal choice for consumer 1 is to reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 - thus letting consumer 2 pay for the high security implied by high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, an extremely large change in income differences reverses
 the withdrawal among the consumers - since a shift from low-income differences
 to high income-differences (through lowering of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

) causes the poorer consumer to no longer view any benefit from the status
 consumption and any further rise in income differences only increases the
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 for consumer 2.
 Likewise, a shift from high-income differences to largely-similar income-differ
ences would mean that the richer consumer no longer sees any benefit from
 participating in the status competition - thus setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 to zero.
 In other words, the lower differences in income - which is used to accumulate
 assets in the long-term - are as undesirable for the richer consumer as
 higher differences in income are for the poorer consumer.
 A widening in income-differences increases 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 - only until it becomes so high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is reduced to zero by the consumer 1.
 Similarly, a lowering of income differences decreases 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 until the incomes are so equal that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is reduced to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equilibrium levels of asset accumulations also correspond to the choices
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 A equilibrium with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily mean lower asset accumulations and growth - since
 status investments also contribute to accmulation of wealth through social
 promotion in the model.

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{2}$

 demonstrate that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 rise with rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

 remains the same.
 With changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$
\end_inset

, the total assets decline for the poorer consumer on withdrawal (i.e.
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{1}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

) and they rise for consumer 2 with rise in income difference.
 As the plots in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 show, a high 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}+A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is achieved when all of the poorer consumer's disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is spent towards status investments.
 The withdrawal from status investments is lowers the total accumulation
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}+A_{2}$
\end_inset

 until the point when changes in income difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 become so high that all gains through status investments only benefit the
 richer consumer.
 This also makes intuitive sense - since the long-term equilibrium suggest
 that either status investments are at highest possible values for the poor
 consumer or they benefit only the richer consumer.

 For the for fitting purposes itself, estimating a function that considers

% HK: a more affluent society will have lower utility at each income level.

% HK: poor are made worse off by greater equality.
 Such an increase in equality will also increase conspicuous  waste by those
 on middle incomes or low and middle incomes, while conspicuous consumption
 by the rich may decrease (our finding too).
 consequently, when we consider corrective taxes on conspicuous consumption,
 we find that the more equally income is distributed, the higher taxes and
 subsidies should be for those with low to middle incomes, and the lower
 they should be  or those with high incomes.
 Indeed, we are able to show that in some circumstances a corrective policy
 with higher tax rates (but also higher subsidies) for those with low incomes
 can lead to a Pareto improvement

\begin_layout Standard
We had set ourselves to find how income inequality could influence growth
 and status consumption in an economy.
 Interpreting growth as asset accumulations and status consumption as investment
s or efforts spent towards economic status, we use a two-band economy under
 the conditions of population stability and a known ordering of asset utilities
 for consumers to argue that a rise in income inequalities need not always
 raise status consumption in the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More particularly, we find that the conditions that population stability
 must prevail in a long-term equilibrium of income bands and that there
 exists a known ordering for asset utilities - together lead to two key
 implications for expenditure towards status.
 First, the expenditure towards status for the poorer (richer) consumer
 need not rise (fall) with increase in income differences.
 Second, a segregation of demand is likely for status competitions under
 inequalities when either the poorer consumer sees no benefits from participatin
g in status competitions or the rich person finds too little security on
 offer from status competitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is tempting to argue using the short-term equilibrium conditions
 that wider income differences make status competitions more stringent and
 the expenditure towards status higher (lower) for the poorer (richer) consumer,
 the long-term equilibrium - under conditions of population stability alone
 - imply a different dynamics where wide income differences could reduce
 expenditure towards status by making promotion difficult (for the poor
 consumers) or security cheaper (for the richer consumers).
 This also means that the growth in the economy - interpreted as the asset
 accumulations of the consumer - might either rise or fall with higher income
 inequality.

\begin_layout Standard
An important result from the model is also that a risk with the accumulated
 wealth is necessary for there to be a status competition at all - one that
 promises income opportunities and securities to the respective positions
 in a finite-bands setting.
 In other words, an inequality in bands cannot maintain a steady state competiti
on without an inherent risk that sets an upper bound on wealth accumulation
 for the richer consumer.
 This notion of risk with the accumulated wealth in the stylised model encompass
es the political or financial risks in an economy.
 If the redistribution in the economy can be interpreted as the security
 costs (or losses) implied by the promotion and demotion functions that
 the richer consumers must pay to maintain the status competitions in the
 model, the reversal of incentives for investments towards status in long-term
 (compared to short-term implications of status consumption rising with
 higher income inequalites) can be viewed simply as a result of higher costs
 for positional security (consisting both of promotion and demotion).
 The particular dynamic interpretation of redistribution costs is independent
 of any particular redistribution mechanism (e.g.
 a taxation rate).

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that the view of status as expected assets under risk may provide
 more insights in the empirical applications where a positive externality
 from status games - e.g.
 from education - cannot be ignored.
 The results from the long-term equilibrium of the model explain how the
 constraints on resources in an economy with income segregation could limit
 the participation of poorer consumers despite an increase in opportunities
 for income mobility.
 More specifically, the long-term constraints due to finite resources on
 income rises can result in a lower participation for investments such as
 education so long as the differences in positions also need to be maintained.

% [Next: greed and loss-aversion] When consumers have a preference for lower
 assets in the low band, the introduction of greed or contentment would
 can shift the equilibrium further.
 Contentment is just the name of loss-aversion associated.
 Consumers might be less loss-averse with respect to A_{0} in which case
 they are more content with lower than A_{0}.
 On the other hand, they might be in a regime where consumers don't like
 being less than A_{0} at all.
 We look at the contentment vs aspiration in the above setup for a given
 
\backslash
kappa .
 The consumer utility uses a reference function defined around long-term
 A_{0} so that there are two regimes.
 First, where being poor may not become successively bad.
 Second, is the regime where contentment is valuable and the consumer below
 A_{0} don't mind it too much compared to how much consumers with more wealth...
 .
 The other regime is when consumer are more greedy and people mind being
 poor a lot compared to being rich.
 We see how either of these regimes are influenced by 
\backslash
kappa vs y_{2}-y_{1}(This way we don't need to deal with measurement of
 g1/g2 but we can argue only what greed and contentment with assets implies).
 Greed can help us relieve the stringent

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The above condition implies that the consumer balances her expected future
 income with the costs on her assets.
 The net asset value from being either in band 1 or band 2 would be balanced
 by the expected returns the consumer 1 gets from putting up 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 towards status competitions.
 Since the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 must be positive and less than unity, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{2})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 must be less than zero.
 In other words, the consumer in band 1 must move from a negative net asset-valu
e to a positive asset value in band 2 (or vice versa).
 Similarly, for the consumer in band 2, the following quantity must amount
 to zero in the long-term equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{2}(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2})\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})+(1-L_{2}(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}))\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2}) & \rightarrow0
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
L(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}) & =\frac{1}{1-\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2})}}\label{eq:l_lte}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
As long as status competition is feasible for consumer 1, she should see
 an increase in the long-term net asset value by being in band 2.
 The possibility of moving from band 1 to band 2 only to observe the net
 asset value decline is ruled out because higher income bands are also meant
 to have a higher asset reference.
 Any peer effects associated with the assets (or a higher reference level
 for assets) would ensure a higher asset reference in the higher asset-band.
 Thus while the consumer in band 1 cannot afford to have a decline in net
 asset value if she moves to the next band, the consumer in the rich band
 might accept a poorer band with a net increase in asset value.
 This implies that the the net asset-value function must be concave (see

\begin_layout Proof
However, the long-term equilibrium also ensures that the consumer arriving
 from the different band gathers no more assets than other consumers in
 the same band.
 Thus, we also have
