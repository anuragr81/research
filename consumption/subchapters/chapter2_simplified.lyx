\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
While status consumption is assumed to be ubiquitous, the possibility that
 extreme wealth inequalities in an economy could discourage status comparisons
 across reference groups separated by wealth has been explored less often.
 Focusing on the context of a developing economy with extreme wealth differences
, we consider status consumption as non-durable consumption in excess of
 consumer needs in her reference group and explore the opposing effects
 of peer influences and extreme wealth differences.
 Using data from Tanzania and Nigeria, we discuss how a segregation of status
 concerns may characterise status consumption in a developing economy.

[Fundamental Needs are the same for the rich] We use the view of status
 as a context driven utility from consumption and wealth to argue also that
 the richer consumers do not have fundamentally different needs - but context-dr
iven costs of status indication.
 The reference dependent status consumption implies that there exists universal
 need of status consumption - but not that the fundamental needs themselves
 are higher for a richer consumer.
 For example, a rich neighborhood having high prices of food does not mean
 that the needs for food are costlier for the richer consumer (if that was
 true, an arbitrageur would take advantage to offer cheaper prices for food
 with the difference in prices for food explained accounted only by costs
 of transportation).
 If we can admit that consumers optimise life-style choices and goals higher
 than nutrition, then the higher costs on food are likely to be be intertwined
 with long-term choices of the consumer (which force her to be a neighborhood
 with higher food prices).
 More expenses on fundamental needs might be a consequence of availing higher
 status - rather than having different needs per se (this is explained by
 Maliath as non-transactional optimisations).

The reduction of private sector didn't experience much opposition under

 With lack of support from workers and ban of producer-consumer societies,
 inconsistencies surfaced in the socialist model.
 The industrial sector also suffered because of import subsidies.
 The approach of ISI (import substituting industrialization) led to oversubsidiz
ing when capital flows had to be adjusted to prevent starvation.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and usage of a capital-intensive technology
 soon resulted in oversubsidizing across sectors, over-reliance on capital
 for development and a consequent decline in capacity utilization of the

Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an environment of wealth disparities, are status comparisons ruled out
 beyond one's own reference groups (there are status competitions within
 every group that are non-overlapping ) or do they substitute being in a
 poorer reference group (less assets) with high status competition (consumption)
? We assess this empirically by comparing two developing economies.
 More specifically, we test if the consumers in richer references face less
 competition for non-durable consumption relative to their needs (and vice
 versa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that in the specific context of urbanisation-related changes in
 the developing economies, status consumption could be largely an appeal
 for urbanisation in the poorest sections of the developing economy.
 This has particular implications for the notion of status consumption in
 developing economies.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the intertemporal substitution framework has been widely used in consumer
 economics, its applications in status consumption have been limited.
 The unavailability of brand variety in the data and the often insufficient
 prices of supposed status goods restrict the applications using intertemporal
 substitution.
 The peculiar characteristic of a status item wherein it both indicates
 a rich consumer's exclusive status and creates bandwagons for the poorer
 consumer also poses a challenge.
 If the demand for status items is always set to grow for all consumers
 as they acquire more assets, then there is little substitution between
 savings and status consumption.
 The intertemporal approach thus seems to be of little use unless one is
 able to track the varying contexts of the consumers as they acquire more
 assets.
 In the proposed chapter, we use a particular dataset on ownership of long-term
 assets along side with the consumption diary to infer the context of status
 consumption in a developing economy.
 Using a model that assumes status to be modified by consumption through
 only durable goods and a local relative advantage in non-durable consumption,
 we examine how the demand for non-durable consumption in relative to one's
 needs varies across disparate regions in two economies in sub-Saharan Africa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we compare the non-durable consumption in the two economies and comment
 on the relative importance of status consumption, the notion of a status
 reference group is key to our understanding of the consumer's context.
 Reference groups help pin down a certain level of status consumption as
 the consumer's social need.
 They also allow us to answer if the not-so-rich spend disproportionately
 higher on status items in an economy or if the high spending on status
 goods is limited to the rich.
 Here, unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary
 emulation (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative
 - reference groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions
 where a consumer identifies her status.
 This is important since the consumer's social need for status is hardly
 as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.

In the proposed model, reference groups are interpreted as the level of
 asset-ownership in the consumer's immediate environment.
 A consumer who resides in an area where the population has more durable
 assets transferable over generations is considered a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (richer) reference group.
 The effect of these reference groups are then tested empirically.
 More specifically, the reference groups are set using the long-term assets
 ownership data in the consumer's locality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Model for status consumption] The model for status consumption we consider
 view status consumption comprising of both long-term durable good and the
 excessive non-durable consumption.
 A consumer in a richer asset-ownership reference only considers the non-durable
 consumption within her own reference rather than the poorer reference where
 either or both of non-durable consumption and durable consumption could
 be lower.
 Within an asset-ownership reference, the consumers compete only with non-durabl
e consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[LTA role] The long-term durable goods owned by the consumer household play
 a key role to this view of status consumption.
 Given a per-head consumption budget 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, the representative household must first pay the costs that are imposed
 on her from being in the particular asset-group 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 before she may spend on food/non-food non-durable consumption relative
 to her needs.
 Here, the needs of the household are assumed to be predetermined and interprete
d as the number of members in the family.
 The per-head non-durable consumption excluding the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (henceforth referred to as

 The excess in a lower reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 could be very different from the excess in a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$

 interested in.

Setting
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial p_{i}}$

, we compare the substitution between food and non-food non-durable consumption
 in the two economies.
 The importance of status consumption is assessed through the differences
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 which comprises of both food and non-food components.
 Observing the substitution between food and non-food items also avoid the
 evident measurement error that would arise by mixing diary consumption
 items (which all food items are recorded as) and the weekly/monthly recall
 items (where non-food items are recorded).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that we observe 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 directly as the expenditure on basic needs and the costs associated with
 owning a certain level of assets.
 The costs associated with having a certain level of assets is probably
 the most important empirical judgment in the analysis that follows.
 Since more assets would invariably result in higher asset costs, a richer
 area i.e.
 a richer asset-band (a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

) would correspond to to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 than a poorer asset-band.
 Excluding the costs imposed by assets allows us to compare the non-durable
 consumption scaled by needs and the asset-possession itself - the two of
 which circumscribe all what status can be achieved with.

% What's not clear is the reason why we are ignoring A on the RHS.
 We're saying that individual consumption levels of non-durable consumption
 should be related to average non-durable consumption and overall assets.
 Using an XT model, one can check whether consumers respond to changes in
 asset values in the area or change in net non-durable consumption (or in
 all consumption).
 A comparison of all consumption vs all non-durable consumption in XT model
 is unnecessary because we assume a cost-structure Psi(r)- suggesting that
 asset-costs are already considered with assets.
 The theoretical justification of the averages are that they are prices
 - of needs (whether basic-food or all-food depends on the availability
 of non-foods prices and the measurement erros by mixing) of asset-maintenance.
 The substitution between asset-costs, needs and nde can be considered -
 so the averages of assets (the role of r), price of needs (average food)
 and (average nde) can then be considered.
 Without AIDS, we can just take q_nde as dependent variable and then consider
 prices (averages) as independent variables.
 Care should be taken on how this corresponds to the model stated in the
 chapter.
 The average of basic-needs + asset costs makes sense, but then we need
 to explain that r_t (price of richness) comprises both of an average needs
 (price) component and an average assets (price) component.
 This also explains that logx - which is not an average and an individual
 value - must remain as independent variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% So in summary, the only substitution we want to present is between nu
 and r_t.
 If we were to use AIDS (let's say), then the weight would be of total asset-cos
ts and nde (not needs).
 The total costs we care about is therefore also just the sum of asset_costs
 (energy, transport) and nu (food, household).
 instead of asset-cost averages we use asset-price-averages and instead
 of price of food+household - we use the total price of food+household (thats'
 the average nde).
 High assets_costs + nu .
 When use q_nde as dependent variable occupation could be used as an instrument.

Excess and asset-costs

The consumption items in the LSMS survey are classified under four broad
 categories - food, energy, transport and household.
 Given the ample evidence for pressures on food-quality in sub-Saharan countries
 (see for example Schneider et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MastersMalawiFoodQuality2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), we argue that an attainment of higher food quality would be visible enough
 in the society and consider it as part of excess.
 When only a small part of the population has access to electricity (e.g.
 about 10% in Tanzania), the improvement of food quality through having
 a refrigerator is a luxury that cannot be considered as a mere basic need
 for the consumer.
 Further, when the needs for food quality are not met for the majority of
 a population, social interactions are likely to separate consumers who
 can afford better food quality from those who can't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than food, the expenditure on energy and transport are treated as
 costs of maintaining a certain level of assets (car, refrigerator, heater
 etc.).

 energy- and transport-related costs) with an example, consider the comparison
 of statuses for two consumers of which only one owns a motorcycle.
 Here, we do not need to compare how much petrol they've purchased when
 we've already taken into account the difference in their transportation-related
 asset(s).
 As energy and transport related assets are already considered as part of
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer, we exclude costs associated with energy and transport
 from the notion of excess non-durable consumption.
 Thus the only non-food relevant expenditure for status that we measure
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 excludes the costs implied by the assets owned by the consumer.
 The items over which the expenditure is aggregated to arrive at total excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (in a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) are listed in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

 These include only the food and

 expenditures.

\begin_layout Standard
The overall prices of non-durable consumption excluding in a particular
 area 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 is determined by averaging the excess expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the local area (
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

-km radius) surrounding the consumer.
 This akin to the unit-value method for prices used in the literature.
 The use of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 is merely to compare the effects of local assets and local costs of non-durable
 consumption (both non-food and food) on the individual non-durable expenditure
 after accounting for the her income.
 The price of food 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 is similarly calculated as the average of food expenditure in the local
 area.

 that we have defined in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

caps "false"

\end_inset

 relies on the stock of durable goods owned by every consumer.
 The durable goods recorded in the LSMS survey range from short-term durable
 items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such
 as land or houses.
 Of these, we are interested only in the long-term assets that can be transferre
d over generations - accumulations that encompass the notion of asset-richness.
 The assets transferred over a generation are readily verified by inspecting
 households in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit
 family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A more appropriate analysis could use the immediate neighborhood of the
 consumer's wards - but not having the geographic location of the ward (or
 the MTAA field in the survey) limits the granularity of our analysis to
 the district's level.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts where the
 consumes resides in order to define the consumer's vicinity based on a
 Euclidean distance
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Other than the 4-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 Euclidean radius around the consumer's district, one could consider a populatio
n-adjusted neighborhood metric around the consumer household by incorporating
 the population mass in the consumer's.
 Such a population-adjusted distance -
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta_{AB}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer in district 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 is the Euclidean distance between coordinates for 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}+N_{B}$
\end_inset

 is the population resident with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

- would be shorter for denser areas but larger for sparser populations (represen
ting a smaller reference for consumers despite being spread over a larger
 geographical area).
 We have not however obtained significant differences in the results with
 such a population-adjusted metric after using the census data.
 This could be both because of the coarse granularity of our reference boundarie
s (district level) and the district boundaries already being wider in the
 rural regions (with only a few exceptions such as Sumbawanga and Nkasi
 in Rukwa which we consider within the same reference on grounds of proximity
 in Euclidean distance).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, we infer consumer's asset-richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the logarithm of average market value of assets owned by the consumers
 within the boundary of reference around the consumer (including the district
 which the consumer belongs to), the non-durable consumption averages as
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 for food and non-food items respectively.
 A constraint that the aggregation into 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 imposes is that the number of observed households within the reference
 boundary should be high enough to average out the idiosyncratic effects
 and issues related to seasonality of data-capture (e.g.
 less electricity needed in winter etc.).
 At the time of writing this chapter, we've made sure no districts with
 less than 10 observations per year are included in our analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Empirical Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal of our analysis is to test if after accounting for income,
 the non-durable excess expenditure is influenced more with the local asset-owne
rship levels or the local non-durable consumption averages in the two countries.
 If only asset-levels determine the non-durable consumption level then then
 that would imply a segregation of non-durable consumption based on asset-richne
ss.
 If on the other hand, the effect of asset-richness on non-durable consumption
 is weak compared to the the local averages of non-durable consumption,
 the non-durable consumption is likely to be driven by the local levels
 of consumption.
 Likewise, when neither the local non-durable consumption averages nor the
 local asset-averages are significant for the individual's consumption after
 accounting for income, then the non-durable consumption is predominantly
 driven by the income of the individual and the different clusters of income
 and assets are spread uniformly across the regions (over which we calculated
 local averages).
 Lastly, when non-durable consumption is influenced both by local asset-averages
 and local-non-durable consumption averages in the local areas then the
 non-durable consumption patterns are clustered both according to levels
 of asset and regional costs non-durable consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is measured as the per-head on non-durable excess items and the consumer
 income is proxied with the total per-expenditure including all expenses
 (asset costs, food, excess etc.).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t}),p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 are the local average of food and non-food non-durable expenditures (excluding
 asset costs) in the area surrounding the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the local asset-ownership level in the area (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have emphasised before, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not include the cost of owning and maintaining assets since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 already includes the contribution of assets to one's status.
 As a consumer does not choose the maintenance of assets separately from
 choosing to purchase the asset, the idea that a representative consumer
 increases her per-head non-durable consumption with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (excess) by availing a higher quality or quantity than necessary makes
 sense only if we exclude the costs imposed on the consumer due to having
 bought certain assets (through maintenance, repair, fees etc.) from the
 per-head consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The average 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 thus also excludes the cost of maintaining assets.
 The status advantage that the consumer gets from being in an asset-rich
 neighborhood is meant to be measured with both 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - with a possible substitution between the two.

Non-parametric view
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the overall poverty levels may be similar in Nigeria and Tanzania,
 the extreme differences in Tanzania (particularly between the south of
 the country and the east) are not seen in Nigeria.
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"

).
 In Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) , on the other hand, the income-disparities in occupations and asset-differenc
es seem less extreme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The range of occupations available to the consumer populations in the surveys
 from Tanzania and Nigeria are varied.
 To compare the role of occupations in the two economies, we standardise
 all the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria into
 occupation ranks ranging from 0 to 3.
 The occupation ranks are essentially based on sorting the varied occupations
 in the two economies by the income of consumers in the respective countries.
 The occupation-ranks mapped from the occupation levels in Tanzania and
 Nigeria are presented in Table

In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this the sparsity of income data.
 In the LSMS data used for Nigeria and Tanzania, the income data is not
 available for the entire survey population.
 This is partly due to significant informal sectors in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{education_rank_tnz}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for Tanzania and Table

 for Nigeria).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regional disparities in economic conditions and population density provide
 a particular context to status differences in the economy - as the disparity
 in services as well as amenities across the country have strong implications
 for any consumption deemed status-related.
 A key interpretation of our model for status consumption is that status
 competitions are essentially non-overlapping between two groups of consumers
 when one has both extremely low asset-levels compared to the other and
 extremely low non-durable consumption levels as well.
 In other words, a consumer cannot be in a status competition with another
 consumer when she has both lower level of asset-richness and inferior (or
 deficient) non-durable consumption as well.
 With the south of Tanzania not having nearly the same level of electricity
 consumption nor comparable durable goods associated with electricity as
 the east of Tanzania, the non-durable consumption from the consumers in
 south of Tanzania is hardly in reference to the consumers in urban east
 of Tanzania.
 We use the parametric analysis to test for this effect in Tanzania and
 Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status concerns are necessarily localised, the non-durable consumption
 for consumers in the asset poor south and west are indeed much lower.
 On the other hand, despite lower incomes in the central north, the median
 net-asset worth of the individuals in regions such as Singida and Manyara
 could match up with that of the consumers in the east coast of Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 With the average asset-values and food prices relatively more aligned in
 the central and eastern regions, the occupational/asset differences and
 non-durable consumption are more comparable between the two regions.
 In Tanzania, where we have data on subjective well-being for individuals,
 we also find that eastern regions have much higher perceptions and excess
 as well as high value of assets compared to central areas
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The inherent claim while interpreting the subject well-being data in this
 manner is that the consumers with higher excess registering higher satisfaction
 than those with less excess, would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
be happier.
 The converse is a stronger claim - since happier consumers need not have
 higher excess to be happier.
 In fact if status is a social need, a consumer as well feel miserable as
 she raises expenses on excess.
 The attribution of consumer contentment to a particular type of consumption
 (e.g.
 excess) is requires more assumption than merely testing whether a high
 excess is aligned with high consumer perception or not.
 In other words, the the claim that consumers make consumption choices to
 optimise subjective well-being is a much stronger argument than what we
 require.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - but that the southern regions have relatively higher satisfaction levels
 than the centre.
 Still, while poverty may not influence subjective well-being so much in
 Tanzania, it cannot be ruled out that the poor are not in the same status
 competition as the rich.
 Unfortunately, not having a similar detail for Nigeria in the LSMS survey
 prevents us from comparing subjective well being data in the two economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the regional disparities, they appear less extreme in Nigeria even
 though the southern areas of the country seem to have more higher-paid
 occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Despite the differences in educational and occupational levels in between
 the north and south of the country, the disparity in asset ownership is
 not nearly as extreme as in Tanzania.
 The implications of this uniformity on non-durable consumption is discussed
 using a parametric approach in the Section

 of the household has a positive effect on the proportion of expenditure
 on food 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{food}$
\end_inset

 in both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 The higher portion of expenditure spent on food spent in families with
 older household-heads (the median household-head age is 43 in Tanzania
 and 48 in Nigeria), suggests a stronger demand for quality in families
 young children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Expensive food regions seem to decrease non-food proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{nonfood}$
\end_inset

 and increase food proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{food}$
\end_inset

.
 This seems to suggest again that food (including its quality) is more important
 to the consumers in both Nigeria and Tanzania than the non-food non-durable
 consumption.
 On the other hand, since expensive non-food regions increase non-food portion
 as well, the consumers with higher non-food expenditure proportion tend
 to be in the same regions.
 Put another way, the expenditure on non-food items is clustered across
 regions in both Nigeria and Tanzania

 respectively).
 The significance of excess consumption here is different from the typical
 conditions of a developed economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The role of education ranks seems higher in Tanzania than Nigeria.
 This suggests that consumer lifestyles are more segregated by education
 levels - likely due to individuals with high education levels being limited
 to fewer urban areas in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A view of status in terms of non-durable excess and long-term assets implies
 that extreme asset-differences may not be overcome with non-durable consumption
 excesses in a status competition.
 The status competitions among consumers where extreme asset differences
 exist must therefore undergo a separation of reference groups.
 The segregation of status consumption patterns implied by such a separation
 is what we intend to observe as effects of extreme asset-differences on
 non-durable consumption excesses using the model in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 That such a segregation may dominate in an economy make it difficult to
 argue for utility from status consumption goods.
 In the comparison of the two economies we have used measured the non-durable
 excess as the non-food portion of the non-durable consumption excluding
 any costs implied by assets.
 The empirical analysis based on this measure allows us to understand how
 significantly might non-durable consumption excesses be segmented by asset-poss
essions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

% Urban rural differences create segmentation so what?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the urban settings would always have higher assets and higher non-durable
 consumption opportunities overall, our intention in a cross-country comparison
 is to measure how extreme these differences in the economies to be compared.
 Asset bands provide us the needed reference-point which we use to argue
 that a segregation in competitions may exist when the differences in assets
 are wide.
 Thus, while status competition are evidently more predominant in cities
 - developing and developed economies alike - the urban-rural differences
 in assets are less extreme in the developed economies and a substitution
 between owning assets and non-durable consumption follows.
 This is less likely in developing economies when there are a significant
 number of households at a subsistence level with very little asset possessions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We preform the comparison of status consumption across Tanzania and Nigeria
 in two steps.
 First, we compare the non-durable consumption in the two countries.
 Second, we evaluate how much the extreme asset differences influence excess
 non-durable consumption in the two economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first step of our comparison, we find that the more uniformly distributed
 assets in Nigeria imply that long-term asset ownership has a more significant
 role towards status (in Nigeria).
 Since a significant population in both the economies spends a large portion
 of their budget on food, the overall non-durable consumption is comparable
 for Tanzania and Nigeria.
 But since status can only achieved through long-term assets and non-durable
 excesses, non-durable consumption (including food) is all that may carry
 some status in a population of consumers with no-reported assets (e.g.
 in Tanzania).
 An FE regression for 
\begin_inset Formula $log(q_{ne})$
\end_inset

 (non-durable consumption including both food and non-food nondurable consumptio
n) against 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for panel data households (2010-2012) in Nigeria (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessFENGR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ) also suggests that as consumers gain more assets they seem to substitute
 with less non-durable consumption in Nigeria.
 The substitution is not as significant in Tanzania (see Table

\begin_layout Standard
In the second step of our comparison we compare the effect of asset-differences
 on non-durable consumption after accounting for occupation and education
 differences as well.
 The differences in non-durable consumption between medium occupations and
 low occupations is relatively less.
 While excess is higher for highest occupations for both Nigeria and Tanzania,
 it is more sensitive to asset-accumulation in Tanzania.
 The extreme differences in wealth thus imply a less overlapping status
 consumption in Tanzania.
 Therefore, the effect of asset-richness on levels of non-durable consumption
 and the segregation of demand for excess are significant in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that above conclusion are drawn for given level
 of the granularity of aggregation.
 The income and occupation differences within levels finer than the district
 level would might show finer differences in status consumption across income
 levels but our interpretations have only used district-level aggregations
 to understand the role of wider regional disparities on status consumption
 in economies.
 The primary goal that the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 has been to consider the effect of urban and rural disparities on non-durable
 consumption as we find the extreme urban-rural differences may more relevant
 to status competitions in the developing economies than visible goods which
 are limited to a small urban population.

% 1.
 C5 says that higher price-non-food-expenditure suppresses w_food (individuals
 would decrease w_food when there is higher non-food area - so they move
 together with the food consumption).
 higher-price-food-expenditure on the other hand increases food weight (meaning
 consumers run to food when prices are higher).
 C6 suggests that consumers run to food more easily in TNZ - thus indicating
 more non-durable consumption in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 2.
 C3 says that older households have higher food consumption.
 C7 means that bigger households tend to have lower w_food than smaller
 households.
 Younger households have less w_food - meaning more non-durable consumption
 among younger people in both countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 3.
 D5 says high-food-expenditure-regions have lower non-durable consumption
 (again because food is more important).
 D5 also says that high-non-food-expenditure regions have a positive influence
 so the consumption does move together for non-food.
