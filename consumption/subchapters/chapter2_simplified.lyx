\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
While status consumption is assumed to be ubiquitous, the possibility that
 extreme wealth inequalities in an economy could discourage status comparisons
 across reference groups separated by wealth has been explored less often.
 Focusing on the context of a developing economy with extreme wealth differences
, we consider status consumption as non-durable consumption in excess of
 consumer needs in her reference group and explore the opposing effects
 of peer influences and extreme wealth differences.
 Using data from Tanzania and Nigeria, we discuss how a segregation of status
 concerns may characterise status consumption in a developing economy.

\begin_layout Standard
[Fundamental Needs are the same for the rich] We use the view of status
 as a context driven utility from consumption and wealth to argue also that
 the richer consumers do not have fundamentally different needs - but context-dr
iven costs of status indication.
 The reference dependent status consumption implies that there exists universal
 need of status consumption - but not that the fundamental needs themselves
 are higher for a richer consumer.
 For example, a rich neighborhood having high prices of food does not mean
 that the needs for food are costlier for the richer consumer (if that was
 true, an arbitrageur would take advantage to offer cheaper prices for food
 with the difference in prices for food explained accounted only by costs
 of transportation).
 If we can admit that consumers optimise life-style choices and goals higher
 than nutrition, then the higher costs on food are likely to be be intertwined
 with long-term choices of the consumer (which force her to be a neighborhood
 with higher food prices).
 More expenses on fundamental needs might be a consequence of availing higher
 status - rather than having different needs per se (this is explained by
 Maliath as non-transactional optimisations).

Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an environment of wealth disparities, do consumers rule out status comparison
s beyond their asset-groups (i.e.
 have completely different status consumption) or do they substitute being
 in a poorer reference group (less assets) with high status competition
 (consumption)? We assess this empirically for a developing economy by testing
 if the consumers in richer references face less competition for relative
 quality in non-durable consumption (and vice versa).
 Lower status consumption (viewed as local relative non-durable consumption)
 in higher asset groups indicates a substitution implied between being asset-ric
h and facing stiff competitions through status consumption.
 Alternatively, the richer groups exhibiting more intense competitions through
 high non-durable consumption would imply segregated status consumption
 - as poorer consumers with lower assets cannot be in a competition with
 richer consumers with more assets who also have a higher status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, is it possible to argue that in the specific context of urbanisation-re
lated changes in the developing economies, status consumption is largely
 an appeal for urbanisation in the poorest sections of the developing economy?
 This may have particular implications for the notion of status consumption
 in developing economies.

Model

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the intertemporal substitution framework has been widely used in consumer
 economics, its applications in status consumption have been limited.
 The unavailability of brand variety and the often insufficient prices of
 supposed status goods in consumer surveys tend to restrict the empirical
 approaches using intertemporal substitution - but the peculiar characteristic
 of a status item wherein it both indicates a rich consumer's exclusive
 status and creates bandwagons for the poorer consumer - also seems to pose
 a challenge.
 The returns from status items to the consumer cannot be substituted with
 savings when the demand for status items can always grow for all consumers
 as they acquire more assets.
 The utility of an intertemporal approach might therefore be little unless
 one is able to track the varying social contexts of the consumers as they
 acquire more assets.
 In the proposed chapter, we use a particular dataset on ownership of long-term
 assets along side with the consumption diary to infer the context of status
 consumption in a developing economy.
 Using the model we develop by assuming that status is modified by consumption
 through only durable goods and a local relative advantage in non-durable
 consumption, we examine how the demand for non-durable consumption in excess
 of one's needs varies across disparate regions in an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of a status reference group is key to our understanding of the
 consumer's context in status-related consumption as it helps us pin down
 a certain level of status consumption as the consumer's social need.
 It allows us to answer if the not-so-rich spend disproportionately higher
 on status items in an economy or if the high spending on status goods is
 limited to the rich.
 Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 As the consumer's social need for status is hardly as universal as it is
 for essential food or clothing, reference groups serve a critical role
 in this view of status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the proposed model, reference groups are interpreted as the level of
 asset-ownership in the consumer's immediate environment.
 A consumer who resides in an area where the population has more durable
 assets transferable over generations is considered a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

higher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (richer) reference group.
 The utility function which the representative consumer optimises consists
 of the non-durable consumption above needs including any asset-bearing
 costs and the richness of her reference group (defined with long-term assets
 ownership in the consumer's locality).
 Thus given a per-head consumption budget 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, the representative household can either spend on non-durable consumption
 above needs determined by household characteristics (henceforth referred
 to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 or choose a reference position 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the economy-wide asset-hierarchy.
 The needs of the consumer are assumed to be predetermined and tied with
 the number of family units.
 After excluding the needs of the consumer determined by household characteristi
cs and the cost associated with owning assets (fees, maintenance and repair
 costs relevant for the consumer's owned assets), the choice for the consumer
 is therefore between excess and the richness through her reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the above approach does not assume a substitution
 between quantity and quality.
 Instead, the representative consumer pursues quality (or a higher-than-necessar
y quantity) once her basic needs are met.
 The total consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 thus depend both on the needs of the respective families and the local
 costs of consumption in the area.
 Thus we have 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin{alignat}{1}
c_{t} & =\psi_{t}\nu_{t}+\Psi_{t}(r_{t})\label{eq:budget_definition}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 To reiterate, the representative consumer does not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 her needs in the model and the only choice she makes is between higher
 non-durable consumption above needs (excess) set with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and her local surroundings 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Higher excess in a lower reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is essentially substituted with lower excess by the representative consumer
 in a higher (richer) reference.
 What this amounts to is the argument is that the representative consumer
 exercises her choice to move to a village or live in an urban area and
 move between rich and poor areas within a locality likewise.
 While at a descriptive level, such a choice is typically constrained by
 a household's income or social class which limit the consumer's mobility,
 the supposed behaviour of the representative consumer in our model under
 a granted budget 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is only to empirically test the significance of this supposed mobility
 through a measure of substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The following additive log-utility represents this substitution

% What's not clear is the reason why we are ignoring A on the RHS.
 We're saying that individual consumption levels of non-durable consumption
 should be related to average non-durable consumption and overall assets.
 Using an XT model, one can check whether consumers respond to changes in
 asset values in the area or change in net non-durable consumption (or in
 all consumption).
 A comparison of all consumption vs all non-durable consumption in XT model
 is unnecessary because we assume a cost-structure Psi(r)- suggesting that
 asset-costs are already considered with assets.
 The theoretical justification of the averages are that they are prices
 - of needs (whether basic-food or all-food depends on the availability
 of non-foods prices and the measurement erros by mixing) of asset-maintenance.
 The substitution between asset-costs, needs and nde can be considered -
 so the averages of assets (the role of r), price of needs (average food)
 and (average nde) can then be considered.
 Without AIDS, we can just take q_nde as dependent variable and then consider
 prices (averages) as independent variables.
 Care should be taken on how this corresponds to the model stated in the
 chapter.
 The average of basic-needs + asset costs makes sense, but then we need
 to explain that r_t (price of richness) comprises both of an average needs
 (price) component and an average assets (price) component.
 This also explains that logx - which is not an average and an individual
 value - must remain as independent variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% So in summary, the only substitution we want to present is between nu
 and r_t.
 If we were to use AIDS (let's say), then the weight would be of total asset-cos
ts and nde (not needs).
 The total costs we care about is therefore also just the sum of asset_costs
 (energy, transport) and nu (food, household).
 instead of asset-cost averages we use asset-price-averages and instead
 of price of food+household - we use the total price of food+household (thats'
 the average nde).
 High assets_costs + nu .
 When use q_nde as dependent variable occupation could be used as an instrument.

% One issue with using assets-costs to calculate w_ne but using large-asset
 prices is that the consumer subscriptionprices are not the same as asset-prices.
 asset-prices don't influence asset-costs - the % consumer's ownership of
 assets.
 So for asset-prices to be on the RHS, the consumer's ownership needs to
 be in consumer choice.
 w_ne approach is fraught with problems of asset-purchases accuracy as well.

LSMS Data for Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Our analysis uses the consumption microdata from LSMS waves for Tanzania
 from the years 2010, 2012 and 2014 to infer 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 described in the above model (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).

Excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption items in the LSMS survey are classified under four broad
 categories - food, energy, transport and household.
 Given the ample evidence for pressures on food-quality in sub-Saharan countries
 (see for example Schneider et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MastersMalawiFoodQuality2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), we argue that an attainment of higher food quality would be visible enough
 in the society and consider it as part of excess.
 When only a small part of the population has access to electricity (e.g.
 about 10% in Tanzania), the improvement of food quality through having
 a refrigerator is a luxury that cannot be considered as a mere basic need
 for the consumer.
 Further, when the needs for food quality are not met for the majority of
 a population, social interactions are likely to separate consumers who
 can afford better food quality from those who can't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, a mixing of food diary and the monthly recall diary is an approach
 that opens itself to severe measurement errors and compels us to treat
 the non-durable expenditure not excluding the costs associated with acquired
 assets separately from the food expenditure.
 Since the expenditures on energy and transport can be treated as costs
 of maintaining a certain level of assets (car, refrigerator, heater etc.),
 this is a rather simple classification that results in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{itemsclassification}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The idea behind such a treatment of asset-bearing costs - i.e.
 the energy- and transport-related costs - is that while comparing statuses
 of two consumers of which only one owns a motorcycle, we do not need to
 compare how much petrol they've purchased when we've already taken into
 account the difference in their transportation-related asset(s).
 As energy and transport related assets are already considered as part of
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer, we exclude costs associated with energy and transport
 from the notion of excess non-durable consumption.
 Therefore, the only non-food relevant expenditure for status that we measure
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 excludes the costs implied by the assets owned by the consumer.
 The items over which the expenditure is aggregated to arrive at total excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (in a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) are listed in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{itemsclassification}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These include only the food and

 expenditures.

Durable goods and reference level consumption
\end_layout

The asset-richness of the neighborhood that we have defined in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 relies on the stock of durable goods owned by every consumer.
 The durable goods recorded in the LSMS survey - which we use for this notion
 - range from short-term durable items such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Of these, we are interested only in the long-term assets that can be transferre
d over generations - accumulations that encompass the notion of asset-richness.
 The assets transferred over a generation are readily verified by inspecting
 households in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit
 family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts where the
 consumes resides in order to define the consumer's vicinity
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A more appropriate analysis could use the immediate neighborhood of the
 consumer's wards - but not having the geographic location of the ward (or
 the MTAA field in the survey) limits the granularity of our analysis to
 the district's level.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Other than a 4-km Euclidean radius around the consumer's district, we also
 consider a population-adjusted neighborhood metric around the consumer
 household by incorporating the population mass in the consumer's district
 from the 2012 Population and Housing Census (PHC) data for Tanzania.
 Since the districts with the highest population densities are in the Dar-es-sal
aam and Geita regions, we repeat our analyses with the rural distances standardi
sed to the level of Dar-es-salaam districts - effectively aggregating data
 from districts to the same level as that of the district in Dar-es-salaam
 region
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This population-adjusted distance - over which the cluster of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 are aggregated - is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta_{AB}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer in district 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 is the Euclidean distance between coordinates for 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}+N_{B}$
\end_inset

 is population that is meant to reside within the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the distance weighted by the total population in districts 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 which are meant to be in the consumer's vicinity depending on a given threshold.
 The bubble around the consumer that determines her locality comprises of
 districts that are at a distance less than the given threshold.
 It is evident that the population-adjusted distance is shorter for denser
 areas but larger for sparser populations (which represent an effectively
 smaller reference for consumers' in the bubble despite being spread over
 a larger geographical area).
 In other words, denser areas imply a narrower reference group over which
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 are calculated.
 For example, the population-distances would be higher in Arusha (region
 1 in the survey) but far less in Dar-es-salaam (region 7 in the survey).

 The results discussed in the Section

 are not however significantly different from those using a Euclidean distance
 approach .
 This is both because of the coarse granularity of our reference boundaries
 (district level) and the district boundaries already being wider in the
 rural regions (with only a few exceptions such as Sumbawanga and Nkasi
 in Rukwa which we consider within the same reference on grounds of proximity
 in Euclidean distance).

In summary, we infer consumer's asset-richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the logarithm of average market value of assets owned by the consumers
 within the boundary of reference around the consumer (including the district
 which the consumer belongs to) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 as the average expenditure on items

 (see Table

 All consumers within the reference necessarily have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$

\end_inset

 while their

\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 varies.
 A constraint that this aggregation imposes is that the number of observed
 households within the reference boundary should be high enough to average
 out the idiosyncratic effects and issues related to seasonality of data-capture
 (e.g.
 less electricity needed in winter etc.).
 At the time of writing this chapter, we've made sure no districts with
 less than 10 observations per year are included in our analyses.

[That

 is effectively a proxy of social needs is not clarified enough ]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal of our analysis is to test whether the consumers in richer
 references use less relative quality (and vice versa) or not.
 To this end, we look at the variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - the per-head expenditure in excess of neighbourhood's average per-head
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 - across 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 based on the model in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 To recall, the costs of lifestyle in a particular region that we measure
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 does not include the cost of owning and maintaining assets from 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 already includes the contribution of assets to one's status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since a consumer does not choose the maintenance of assets separately from
 choosing to purchase the asset, the idea that a representative consumer
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scales-up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 her per-head non-nondurable consumption with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (excess) by availing a higher quality or quantity than necessary makes
 sense only if we exclude the costs imposed on the consumer due to having
 bought certain assets (through maintenance, repair, fees etc.) from the
 per-head consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 which the consumer scales up encompasses the social need of being in the
 vicinity 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and excludes the cost of maintaining assets.
  Similarly, the advantage that the consumer gets from being in an asset-rich
 neighborhood is meant to be measured with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - with a possible substitution between the two.
 Thus as the consumer scales up her required expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})\cdot\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for higher utility (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:budget_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 would not include the contribution from asset purchases or asset costs
 but merely the indication of how much below or above the consumer wants
 to be from average 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r)$
\end_inset

 imposed by her locality 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Given two consumers in a locality who have needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1},\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 and consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively for example, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}\equiv\frac{c_{1}}{\psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}\equiv\frac{c_{2}}{\psi_{2}}$
\end_inset

 for the two consumers and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r)=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\frac{x_{1}}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=\frac{x_{2}}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

 .
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}\pi(r)+\nu_{2}\pi(r)=x_{1}+x_{2}$
\end_inset

, we view 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1},\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 as the excess measures for the two consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While one may never tell from the consumption diaries alone whether a consumer's
 high expenditure on non-durable consumption is due to the local social
 need (bandwagon behaviour) or competitive (snob) behaviour, the LSMS survey
 does allow us to gauge the extent to which excess consumption increases
 consumer contentment with the data on consumers' subjective well-being.

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth clarifying that our analysis of the subjective-well-being data
 does not argue that the consumers optimise their subjective perception
 through consumption.
 While there is some descriptive sense in the argument that there is nothing
 else the consumers would rather optimise - our model for consumption does
 not identify variables that influence her happiness and thus while the
 consumers may believe that being rich makes them happier, it cannot be
 ruled out that the consumers may choose to stay miserable in order to achieve
 happiness in their future or of their progeny.

 how consumer perceptions may be shaped by consumption rather than how they
 influence consumer choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument that a consumer makes consumption choices by optimising their
 perceptions is much stronger than the converse that the consumers improve
 their perception by choosing consumption.
 Our intertemporal substitution approach is  better positioned to treat
 happiness as a social need constrained with budget constraints and endowments
 rather than as a motivation for consumption.
 We therefore view consumer perceptions only as a measure of what the consumer
 feels after having exercised her choice rather than what motivates her
 choice.

Non-parametric view
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most pervasive observation from the LSMS data for Tanzania is the disparity
 in income/occupations between the east-coast and the rest of the country.
 The occupations associated with higher income are far fewer in the hinterland
 than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 To explore the effect of this disparity on status consumption in more detail
 we examine the variation in excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 with respect to occupation/education levels and distribution of long-term
 assets in the economy.
 In this analysis, the occupation levels are measured using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ranks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 derived from the income-data in the survey by mapping the occupation levels
 to values (ranks) ranging from 0 to 3 (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:occupation_rank"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:education_rank"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 These mappings are also used to vary the reference boundaries to include
 only those with the same occupation/education rank as oneself (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ParametricRegressions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We believe that the relative poverty in the rural areas of Tanzania and
 high population density in the central and eastern Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PopulationDistribution2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) provides a particular context to status differences in the economy and
 that the disparity in services as well as amenities across the country
 has strong implications for any consumption deemed status-related.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status concerns are necessarily localised, one would expect that the
 non-durable consumption for consumers in the asset poor south and west
 are much lower.
 But the extreme poverty in the southern regions means that the food prices
 are not so much lower despite lower incomes in the region (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodPrices2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a comparison of food-prices
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The food basket comprises of the cheapest item in carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables sub-categories.
 The minimum recommended quantities for the household are multiplied with
 the available market prices in the survey.
 For most regions (districts), the basket consists of recommended per-head
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Thus while the poor consumer in the south may not need a lot to differentiate
 herself from others in her reference group, the extreme poverty would fail
 to make her indifferent between being poor in the densely populated regions
 in the east and being slightly more asset-rich in poor south.
 A consumer cannot compete with another for status while having both a low
 relative stock of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and less non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 As we now detail with a comparison of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 , the regional differences seem to dominate the local hierarchies for south
 vs the east - due to both food prices being comparable with the eastern
 region and the amenities available to the urban residents that are unimaginable
 in the remote south.
 In other words, the excess non-durable consumption in the south can never
 provide a utility comparable to that in the eastern coast.
 We also observe that despite lower incomes in the central north, the median
 net-asset worth of the individuals in regions such as Singida and Manyara
 (region around -5S,36E) could match up with that of the consumers in the
 east coast of Tanzania (-6S,40E) (see the differences in occupation ranks
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.).
 This is largely due to insufficient coverage of the income surveys and
 significant informal sectors in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 With the average asset-values and food prices relatively more aligned in
 the central and eastern regions, the occupational/asset differences and
 non-durable consumption are more comparable between the two regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To inspect the differences non-durable consumption across regions in Tanzania
 in more detail, we provide local regression (loess) estimates which smoothen
 the plotted values in the household's surroundings (i.e.
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 coordinates of the resident's district).
 The excess non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the unit log local asset i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu_{t}}{r_{t}}$
\end_inset

 is plotted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the assets-worth of the individual household 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 for year 2012 are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:log_assets_2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The loess plots and the distribution of assets suggest a proportionately
 high non-durable consumption in the central region.
 A consumer could be indifferent to living in a poor neighborhood in the
 Dar-es-Salaam and being slightly richer in the Singida.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To verify that the variations in the non-durable consumption are not solely
 due to higher food prices, we compare the food and non-food expenditures
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodNonFood_x"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as well.
 These plots do not suggest that food expenditures are the primary driver
 for variation in non-durable consumption between east-coast and central
 regions.
 The differences in consumption (durable and non-durable) indicate overall
 poverty in the south (-10S,36E) as well as far north regions (-3S,32E)
 and the relatively higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}/r_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the less densely populated central Tanzania (see the population distribution
 for Tanzania in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PopulationDistribution2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The variation of non-durable consumption in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is thus characterised by higher expenditure relative to asset-richness
 (measure by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu_{t}}{r_{t}}$
\end_inset

 ) in the south/far-north (due in part to low levels of asset ownership
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) and slightly higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the central north regions (-8S,36E) as well as the eastern coast (-4S,40E).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is associated with higher satisfaction or not is verified using the data
 on subjective well-being in the survey.
 More specifically, if for the same level of assets, the consumers with
 higher excess register higher satisfaction than those with less excess,
 we can infer that a higher excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 makes the consumer happier.
 Since the converse does not hold i.e.
 happier consumers need not have higher excess, the subjective perception
 data is only used to test whether the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 makes consumers happier or not and eventually how perceptions vary with
 excess and assets.
 Since status is a social need, a consumer could in fact be miserable as
 she raises expenses on relative non-durable consumption to satisfy status
 requirements.
 More importantly, as we don't value consumer perceptions in a market and
 consider only what is revealed from consumer expenditures, we are prevented
 from viewing consumer perceptions under economic constraints and using
 revealed preference methods to attribute consumer contentment to a particular
 type of consumption (e.g.
 excess).
 We can nevertheless use the subjective well-being data to test whether
 consumers of different expenditures (e.g.
 the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

) gain different perceptions across the economy and this we using the data
 for housing, financial and overall well-being.
 The consumer's perception of status is encompassed by her perception of
 well-being in the present circumstances and are also localised the way
 the well-being perceptions are.
 The test whether consumers are more content with higher excess (for the
 same assets) is thus feasible without the claim that consumers make consumption
 choices to optimise subjective well-being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the loess results in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SubjectiveWellBeing2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, a rudimentary view might suggest that a positive (negative) outlook of
 the future is related to having higher assets.
 This seems particular true for eastern regions which have much higher perceptio
ns as well as high value of assets (see area around -8S, 40E in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SubjectiveWellBeing2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, it is noticeable that the poorer regions do not have the poorest
 perceptions - as the regions in the centre stand out in their negative
 perceptions (see area around -4S,34E).
 These regions in the centre (around -4S,34E) have both low non-durable
 consumption per head per unit-asset 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}/r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and relatively low assets.
 The perceptions in the asset poor southern regions is relatively higher
 (see -10S,40E) - confirming that the perceptions of quality of life are
 localised.
 Neither asset poverty nor high food prices seem to influence the subjective
 perceptions of the quality of life for the consumer in southern areas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relatively low non-durable consumption in areas with low perception
 suggests a role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in consumer perception.
 Similarly, the high subjective perception of life in the eastern regions
 (despite perceptions for housing and relative richness being much worse
 e.g.
 around - 2S,40E) demonstrates that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 also has a role to play in the denser urban areas.
 The latter seems due to the influence yielded by the urban amenities -
 including better variety in food (which in turn seems to be assisted with
 the availability of electricity and refrigeration).
 In summary, poverty may not influence subjective well-being so much in
 Tanzania - but without ruling out the possibility that the poor may not
 in the same status competition as the rich.

\begin_layout Standard
Over the entirety of Tanzania, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the consumers with more assets have overall higher food and non-food expenditur
es even after excluding the asset-driven costs.
 This isn't atypical since lifestyle changes usually require higher non-durable
 consumption as consumers accumulate more assets.
 However, given the disparities in the economy we have noted in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Nonparametric"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we refine this observation with net effects of disparities in assets,
 occupation and amenities on consumption with a parametric approach.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we do find some evidence of substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 While it is evident from the variation in the average of observed 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 with the asset average 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the consumer's vicinity ( see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:log_pi_r_with_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 ) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 should rise with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, the extreme regional disparities also imply that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 varies significantly across regions (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LoessPi_r2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The net effect of the regional disparities and local disparities in incomes
 is so that the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 at local levels is more sensitive to differences in occupation levels whereas
 regional disparities overweigh at higher (coarser) levels in the economy.
 We verify this observation by inspecting different quantiles of excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and by varying the notion of asset-localities to consider consumers close
 to one's own occupational/educational level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the results from quantile regression of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the dependent variable shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessQuantile}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we find that the education ranks 2 and 3 are associated with lower excess
 quantiles (see 
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
 results).
 More specifically, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for education rank 2 is in lowest quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
) and that for education rank 3 is in medium quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
).
 The highly educated have less excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in high quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q90
\family default
\size default
) but high excess in low quantiles.
 Unlike education levels, the occupational differences have a more significant
 influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - which is consistently high for those with high-earning occupations and
 low for those in the poorer occupations.
 This holds for all quantiles - i.e.
 regardless of whether one is in a disadvantaged or a rich region and whether
 one has a relative local asset advantage or hasn't, the effects of occupation
 on lifestyle remain significant.
 This tell us that the relative advantage from having a higher income occupation
 is not limited to the Dar-es-salaam (which is where excess is the highest).
 The economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
\size small
Ar
\family default
\size default
) is higher than that of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
\size small
r
\family default
\size default
) in both 
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
, implies that the local richness drives up the lifestyle costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for most consumers - despite the average consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 rising on the whole with average assets 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the income differences dominate at the local level for
 excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 but regional disparities are more important than occupational differences
 at the coarser level.
 Further, the significant negative coefficients for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\family typewriter
\size small
r
\family default
\size default
 ) at high quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q90
\family default
\size default
) also suggests that highest spenders of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 are limited to a few regions (e.g.
 Dar-es-Salaam and Zanzibar in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This is also verified with the loess plot in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodNonFood_x"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Loosely speaking, one could therefore say that the consumption is bandwagon-lik
e at local levels but has snob-like characteristics at coarser levels.
 The variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 against 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 is inspect with a linear estimation in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessLinear}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Similar to the observations from the quantile regression, the relative
 significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
\size small
r
\family default
\size default
) over the personal wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
\size small

\family default
\size default
) dominates when taken over the entirety of Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 by choosing narrower reference groups based on the occupation levels or
 education levels - i.e.
 by calculating average expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 by taking expenditure only from consumers who have the same level of occupation
 or education as oneself, we find little evidence of occupation levels influenci
ng excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 at coarser levels.
 More particularly, one expects a sharper rise in the expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 rises with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is narrowed to one's own occupation and education level (since better occupatio
ns and higher education level should decrease 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 - the average consumption of those with same occupation/education).
 But taken as a whole, the narrower references do not seem to have more
 economic significance than the regional differences.
 Therefore, while occupation and education do influence relative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 within consumer localities, the effect of occupation-level on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not strong over the entirety of the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that while the above analysis of urban and rural disparities may
 appear to ignore any differences between the consumer's agricultural and
 industrial assets, the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 does consider the effect of urban and rural differences due to urban and
 rural disparities in wealth.
 Thus, if a consumer gains more status by owning a luxury car in the city
 than owning a tractor (which cost the same) in a village, our approach
 does not differentiate between the vehicle being a tractor or a luxury
 car but it does consider the asset in a rich area (city) and the poor area
 (village).
 The measures of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 depending only on their reported prices alone (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{assetslist}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) therefore suffice for the above analysis.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using asset ownership to define the consumer's context, we have considered
 status consumption in an intertemporal framework while accounting for the
 income and lifestyle disparities that characterise a developing economy.
 Instead of focusing on visible consumption, we look at status consumption
 as non-necessary non-durable consumption apart from the stock of durable
 goods which serve as consumer's endowments.
 The non-parametric plots and quantile regressions for Tanzania present
 some evidence of substitution between having higher assets and availing
 relative local advantages in the non-durable consumption at regional levels
 - but the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is weak overall - esp for medium occupations.
 While the econometric results point to the consumers in asset-richer areas
 having less inequalities in non-durable consumption among themselves than
 in rural areas, the role of increased urban non-durable consumption in
 consumer contentment suggests a race towards urban lifestyles and consumption
 related to it.
 This is based on the observation that consumers with medium incomes exhibit
 competitions of some intensity whereas there is segregation of demand in
 non-durable consumption at both higher and lowest income levels (poorer
 consumers cannot be in a status competition with richer consumers).
 We expect other developing countries to share such trends - so that the
 consumers in remote areas may have less concerns/avenues for status-related
 consumption while the urban amenities - which increase non-durable consumption
 - significantly influence consumer contentment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Localising the consumer's context and arguing that status can be modified
 through consumption only through durable assets and relative non-durable
 differences shows us how consumers in a developing economy withstand extreme
 differences in amenities and yet participate in non-durable consumption
 to address local needs constituting status.
 This means that the demand for non-durable urban goods could separate if
 the differences between urban and rural areas rise - whereas a leveling
 of the differences would make the substitution between having more assets
 and higher status consumption possible.
 Viewing other developing economies with varying levels of urbanisation
 could help us better understand how of urban-rural differences and income
 or wealth inequalities in a developing economy could influence consumption
 excesses.
