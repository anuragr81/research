\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
While status consumption is assumed to be ubiquitous, the possibility that
 extreme wealth inequalities in an economy could discourage status comparisons
 across reference groups separated by wealth has been explored less often.
 Focusing on the context of a developing economy with extreme wealth differences
, we consider status consumption as non-durable consumption in excess of
 consumer needs in her reference group and explore the opposing effects
 of peer influences and extreme wealth differences.
 Using data from Tanzania and Nigeria, we discuss how a segregation of status
 concerns may characterise status consumption in a developing economy.

[Fundamental Needs are the same for the rich] We use the view of status
 as a context driven utility from consumption and wealth to argue also that
 the richer consumers do not have fundamentally different needs - but context-dr
iven costs of status indication.
 The reference dependent status consumption implies that there exists universal
 need of status consumption - but not that the fundamental needs themselves
 are higher for a richer consumer.
 For example, a rich neighborhood having high prices of food does not mean
 that the needs for food are costlier for the richer consumer (if that was
 true, an arbitrageur would take advantage to offer cheaper prices for food
 with the difference in prices for food explained accounted only by costs
 of transportation).
 If we can admit that consumers optimise life-style choices and goals higher
 than nutrition, then the higher costs on food are likely to be be intertwined
 with long-term choices of the consumer (which force her to be a neighborhood
 with higher food prices).
 More expenses on fundamental needs might be a consequence of availing higher
 status - rather than having different needs per se (this is explained by
 Maliath as non-transactional optimisations).

The reduction of private sector didn't experience much opposition under
 leadership of Nyrere.
 With lack of support from workers and ban of producer-consumer societies,
 inconsistencies surfaced in the socialist model.
 The industrial sector also suffered because of import subsidies.
 The approach of ISI (import substituting industrialization) led to oversubsidiz
ing when capital flows had to be adjusted to prevent starvation.
 The rent-seeking in bureaucracy and usage of a capital-intensive technology
 soon resulted in oversubsidizing across sectors, over-reliance on capital
 for development and a consequent decline in capacity utilization of the
 industry

Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an environment of wealth disparities, do consumers rule out status comparison
s beyond their asset-groups (i.e.
 have completely different status consumption) or do they substitute being
 in a poorer reference group (less assets) with high status competition
 (consumption)? We assess this empirically for a developing economy by testing
 if the consumers in richer references face less competition for relative
 quality in non-durable consumption (and vice versa).
 Lower status consumption (viewed as local relative non-durable consumption)
 in higher asset groups indicates a substitution implied between being asset-ric
h and facing stiff competitions through status consumption.
 Alternatively, the richer groups exhibiting more intense competitions through
 high non-durable consumption would imply segregated status consumption
 - as poorer consumers with lower assets cannot be in a competition with
 richer consumers with more assets who also have a higher status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, is it possible to argue that in the specific context of urbanisation-re
lated changes in the developing economies, status consumption is largely
 an appeal for urbanisation in the poorest sections of the developing economy?
 This may have particular implications for the notion of status consumption
 in developing economies.

Model

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the intertemporal substitution framework has been widely used in consumer
 economics, its applications in status consumption have been limited.
 The unavailability of brand variety and the often insufficient prices of
 supposed status goods in consumer surveys tend to restrict the empirical
 approaches using intertemporal substitution.
 The peculiar characteristic of a status item wherein it both indicates
 a rich consumer's exclusive status and creates bandwagons for the poorer
 consumer also poses a challenge.
 If the demand for status items is always set to grow for all consumers
 as they acquire more assets, then there is little substitution between
 savings and status consumption.
 The utility of an intertemporal approach might therefore be little unless
 one is able to track the varying contexts of the consumers as they acquire
 more assets.
 In the proposed chapter, we use a particular dataset on ownership of long-term
 assets along side with the consumption diary to infer the context of status
 consumption in a developing economy.
 Using a model that assumes status to be modified by consumption through
 only durable goods and a local relative advantage in non-durable consumption,
 we examine how the demand for non-durable consumption in excess of one's
 needs varies across disparate regions in an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this analysis, the notion of a status reference group is key to our understan
ding of the consumer's context.
 Reference groups help pin down a certain level of status consumption as
 the consumer's social need.
 More importantly, it allows us to answer if the not-so-rich spend disproportion
ately higher on status items in an economy or if the high spending on status
 goods is limited to the rich.
 Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 This is crucial since the consumer's social need for status is hardly as
 universal as it is for essential food or clothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the proposed model, reference groups are interpreted as the level of
 asset-ownership in the consumer's immediate environment.
 A consumer who resides in an area where the population has more durable
 assets transferable over generations is considered a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

higher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (richer) reference group.
 The utility function which the representative consumer optimises consists
 of the non-durable consumption above needs (excluding any asset-bearing
 costs) and the richness of her reference group.
 The reference groups are defined using the long-term assets ownership data
 in the consumer's locality.
 Given a per-head consumption budget 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, the representative household can either spend on non-durable consumption
 above needs determined by household characteristics (henceforth referred
 to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 or choose a reference position 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the economy-wide asset-hierarchy.
 The needs of the consumer are assumed to be predetermined and tied with
 the number of family units.
 After excluding the needs of the consumer determined by household characteristi
cs and the cost associated with owning assets (fees, maintenance and repair
 costs relevant for the consumer's owned assets), the choice for the consumer
 is therefore between excess and the richness through her reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the above approach does not assume a substitution
 between quantity and quality.
 Instead, the representative consumer pursues quality (or a higher-than-necessar
y quantity) once her basic needs are met.
 The total consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 thus depend both on the needs of the respective families and the local
 costs of consumption in the area.
 Thus we have 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

c_{t} & =\psi_{t}\nu_{t}+\Psi_{t}(r_{t})\label{eq:budget_definition}

 To reiterate, the representative consumer does not choose her needs in
 the model and the only choice she makes is between higher non-durable consumpti
on above needs (excess) set with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and her local surroundings 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Higher excess in a lower reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is essentially substituted with lower excess by the representative consumer
 in a higher (richer) reference.
 The representative consumer in the model may for example exercise her choice
 to move to a village or live in an urban area and move between rich and
 poor areas within a locality likewise.
 Such a choice is typically constrained by a household's income or social
 class which limit the consumer's mobility, but the behaviour of the representat
ive consumer in our model under a granted budget 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is only to empirically test the significance of this supposed mobility
 through a measure of substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The following additive log-utility represents this substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

% What's not clear is the reason why we are ignoring A on the RHS.
 We're saying that individual consumption levels of non-durable consumption
 should be related to average non-durable consumption and overall assets.
 Using an XT model, one can check whether consumers respond to changes in
 asset values in the area or change in net non-durable consumption (or in
 all consumption).
 A comparison of all consumption vs all non-durable consumption in XT model
 is unnecessary because we assume a cost-structure Psi(r)- suggesting that
 asset-costs are already considered with assets.
 The theoretical justification of the averages are that they are prices
 - of needs (whether basic-food or all-food depends on the availability
 of non-foods prices and the measurement erros by mixing) of asset-maintenance.
 The substitution between asset-costs, needs and nde can be considered -
 so the averages of assets (the role of r), price of needs (average food)
 and (average nde) can then be considered.
 Without AIDS, we can just take q_nde as dependent variable and then consider
 prices (averages) as independent variables.
 Care should be taken on how this corresponds to the model stated in the
 chapter.
 The average of basic-needs + asset costs makes sense, but then we need
 to explain that r_t (price of richness) comprises both of an average needs
 (price) component and an average assets (price) component.
 This also explains that logx - which is not an average and an individual
 value - must remain as independent variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% So in summary, the only substitution we want to present is between nu
 and r_t.
 If we were to use AIDS (let's say), then the weight would be of total asset-cos
ts and nde (not needs).
 The total costs we care about is therefore also just the sum of asset_costs
 (energy, transport) and nu (food, household).
 instead of asset-cost averages we use asset-price-averages and instead
 of price of food+household - we use the total price of food+household (thats'
 the average nde).
 High assets_costs + nu .
 When use q_nde as dependent variable occupation could be used as an instrument.

Excess and asset-costs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption items in the LSMS survey are classified under four broad
 categories - food, energy, transport and household.
 Given the ample evidence for pressures on food-quality in sub-Saharan countries
 (see for example Schneider et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MastersMalawiFoodQuality2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), we argue that an attainment of higher food quality would be visible enough
 in the society and consider it as part of excess.
 When only a small part of the population has access to electricity (e.g.
 about 10% in Tanzania), the improvement of food quality through having
 a refrigerator is a luxury that cannot be considered as a mere basic need
 for the consumer.
 Further, when the needs for food quality are not met for the majority of
 a population, social interactions are likely to separate consumers who
 can afford better food quality from those who can't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than food, the expenditure on energy and transport are treated as
 costs of maintaining a certain level of assets (car, refrigerator, heater
 etc.).
 The rather simple classification is presented in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 for Tanzania and in Table

 for Nigeria.
 The idea behind such a treatment of asset-bearing costs (e.g.
 energy- and transport-related costs) is that while comparing statuses of
 two consumers of which only one owns a motorcycle, we do not need to compare
 how much petrol they've purchased when we've already taken into account
 the difference in their transportation-related asset(s).
 As energy and transport related assets are already considered as part of
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer, we exclude costs associated with energy and transport
 from the notion of excess non-durable consumption.
 Thus the only non-food relevant expenditure for status that we measure
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 excludes the costs implied by the assets owned by the consumer.
 The items over which the expenditure is aggregated to arrive at total excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (in a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) are listed in Tables

 These include only the food and

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overall prices of non-durable consumption in a particular area 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nde}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 is determined by averaging the excess expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the local area (
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

-km radius) surrounding the consumer.
 This akin to the unit-value method for prices used in the literature.
 The use of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nde}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 is merely to compare the effects of local assets and local costs of non-durable
 consumption on the individual non-durable expenditure after accounting
 for her income.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 relies on the stock of durable goods owned by every consumer.
 The durable goods recorded in the LSMS survey range from short-term durable
 items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such
 as land or houses.
 Of these, we are interested only in the long-term assets that can be transferre
d over generations - accumulations that encompass the notion of asset-richness.
 The assets transferred over a generation are readily verified by inspecting
 households in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit
 family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A more appropriate analysis could use the immediate neighborhood of the
 consumer's wards - but not having the geographic location of the ward (or
 the MTAA field in the survey) limits the granularity of our analysis to
 the district's level.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts where the
 consumes resides in order to define the consumer's vicinity based on a
 Euclidean distance
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Other than the 4-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 Euclidean radius around the consumer's district, one could consider a populatio
n-adjusted neighborhood metric around the consumer household by incorporating
 the population mass in the consumer's.
 Such a population-adjusted distance -
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta_{AB}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer in district 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 is the Euclidean distance between coordinates for 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}+N_{B}$
\end_inset

 is the population resident with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

- would be shorter for denser areas but larger for sparser populations (represen
ting a smaller reference for consumers despite being spread over a larger
 geographical area).
 We have not however obtained significant differences in the results with
 such a population-adjusted metric after using the census data.
 This could be both because of the coarse granularity of our reference boundarie
s (district level) and the district boundaries already being wider in the
 rural regions (with only a few exceptions such as Sumbawanga and Nkasi
 in Rukwa which we consider within the same reference on grounds of proximity
 in Euclidean distance).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, we infer consumer's asset-richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the logarithm of average market value of assets owned by the consumers
 within the boundary of reference around the consumer (including the district
 which the consumer belongs to) and the non-durable consumption averages
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nde}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

.
 A constraint that the aggregation into 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nde}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 imposes is that the number of observed households within the reference
 boundary should be high enough to average out the idiosyncratic effects
 and issues related to seasonality of data-capture (e.g.
 less electricity needed in winter etc.).
 At the time of writing this chapter, we've made sure no districts with
 less than 10 observations per year are included in our analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Empirical Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal of our analysis is to test if after accounting for income,
 the non-durable excess expenditure is influenced more with the local asset-owne
rship levels or the local non-durable consumption averages instead.
 If only asset-levels determine the non-durable consumption level then then
 that would imply a segregation of non-durable consumption based on asset-richne
ss.
 If on the other hand, the effect of asset-richness on non-durable consumption
 is weak compared to the the local averages of non-durable consumption,
 the non-durable consumption is driven by the local levels.
 Likewise, when neither the local non-durable consumption averages nor the
 local asset-averages are significant for the individual's consumption after
 accounting for income, then the non-durable consumption is predominantly
 driven by the income of the individual and the different clusters of income
 and assets are spread uniformly across the regions (over which we calculated
 local averages).
 When non-durable consumption is influenced both by local asset-averages
 and local-non-durable consumption averages in the local areas then the
 non-durable consumption patterns are segregated based both on regional
 differences and levels of asset levels within them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is measured as the per-head on non-durable excess items, the income is
 proxied with the total expenditure including all expenses (asset costs,
 food, excess etc.).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nde}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 is the local average of non-durable expenditure (excluding asset costs)
 in the area surrounding the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the local asset-ownership level in the area (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not include the cost of owning and maintaining assets since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 already includes the contribution of assets to one's status.
 As a consumer does not choose the maintenance of assets separately from
 choosing to purchase the asset, the idea that a representative consumer
 increases her per-head non-durable consumption with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (excess) by availing a higher quality or quantity than necessary makes
 sense only if we exclude the costs imposed on the consumer due to having
 bought certain assets (through maintenance, repair, fees etc.) from the
 per-head consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The average 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nde}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 thus also excludes the cost of maintaining assets.
 The status advantage that the consumer gets from being in an asset-rich
 neighborhood is meant to be measured with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - with a possible substitution between the two.
 It is worth noting that the asset-costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 serve as the basis for our notion of non-durable excesses as they represent
 the needs associated with the asset-ownership level 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$

\begin_layout Standard
While the overall poverty levels may be similar in Nigeria and Tanzania,
 the extreme differences in Tanzania (particularly between the south of
 the country and the east) are not matched by Nigeria.
 The occupations associated with higher income seem far fewer in the hinterland
 than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"

 In Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) , on the other hand, the income-disparities in occupations and asset-differenc
es seem less extreme.
 The range of occupations available to the consumer populations in the surveys
 from Tanzania and Nigeria are varied.
 We hence perform the comparison of occupations in the two economies by
 standardising the different occupations into occupation ranks ranging from
 0 to 3.
 The occupation ranks are essentially based on sorting the varied occupations
 in the two economies by the income of consumers in the respective countries.
 In of using occupation levels, in the analysis, we use these occupation-ranks
 derived by mapping the occupation levels to ranks ranging from 0 to 3 (see

 or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina et al.

 The primary reason for this the sparsity of income data.
 In the LSMS data used for Nigeria and Tanzania, the income data is not
 available for the entire survey population.
 This is partly due to significant informal sectors in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table

The regional disparities in economic conditions and population density provide
 a particular context to status differences in the economy and that the
 disparity in services as well as amenities across the country are likely
 to have strong implications for any consumption deemed status-related.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key interpretation of the model for status consumption described in
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is that status competitions are essentially non-overlapping between two
 groups of consumers when one has both extremely low asset-levels compared
 to the other and extremely low non-durable consumption levels as well.
 With the south of Tanzania not having nearly the same level of electricity
 consumption nor comparable durable goods associated with electricity as
 the east of Tanzania, the non-durable consumption from the consumers in
 south of Tanzania is hardly in reference to the consumers in urban east
 of Tanzania.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status concerns are necessarily localised, the non-durable consumption
 for consumers in the asset poor south and west are indeed much lower.
 On the other hand, despite lower incomes in the central north, the median
 net-asset worth of the individuals in regions such as Singida and Manyara
 could match up with that of the consumers in the east coast of Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 With the average asset-values and food prices relatively more aligned in
 the central and eastern regions, the occupational/asset differences and
 non-durable consumption are more comparable between the two regions.
 In Tanzania, where we have data on subjective well-being for individuals,
 we also find that eastern regions have much higher perceptions and excess
 as well as high value of assets compared to central areas
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The inherent claim while interpreting the subject well-being data in this
 manner is that the consumers with higher excess registering higher satisfaction
 than those with less excess, would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
be happier.
 The converse is a stronger claim - since happier consumers need not have
 higher excess to be happier.
 In fact if status is a social need, she might as well feel miserable as
 she raises expenses on excess.
 The attribution of consumer contentment to a particular type of consumption
 (e.g.
 excess) is far more challenging than testing whether high excess is aligned
 with high consumer perception or not ; the claim that consumers make consumptio
n choices to optimise subjective well-being is a much stronger argument
 than we require.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - but that the southern regions have relatively higher satisfaction levels
 than the centre.
 Still, while poverty may not influence subjective well-being so much in
 Tanzania, it cannot be ruled out that the poor are not in the same status
 competition as the rich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regional disparities are less extreme in Nigeria even though the southern
 areas of the country seem to have more higher-paid occupations and a higher
 expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall.
 Despite the differences in educational and occupational levels in between
 the north and south of the country, the disparity in asset ownership is
 not nearly as extreme as in Tanzania.
 We explore the implications of this uniformity on non-durable consumption
 with a parametric approach in Section

Parametric Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Summary] The assets are higher in Nigeria and more uniformly distributed
 than in Tanzania.
 So non-durable consumption should be more important in Tanzania while Nigeria
 should have a higher role of assets.
 The expenditure on non-food seems to decline with higher average costs
 in both.
 Asset distribution has a fundamental role to play.
 In Tanzania, they just aren't there.
 Richer areas suppress non-food expenditure a lot in Tanzania.
 So we can say there is far less status consumption in Tanzania (status
 consumption is really futile).
 On the original question of income differences being more, we find that
 the asset-differences do have an influence.
 If there are more asset-differences the consumers (do we prove that) have
 to rely on non-durable consumption - but this effect is limited by the
 limited options for non-durable consumption except food.

The areas with higher average non-durable consumption have the effect of
 reducing non-durable consumption for the individual after accounting for
 income in both economies.
 Thus the individual consumption moves together with the local consumption
 levels after accounting for total income, the consumer's non-durable consumptio
n is slightly relative stable with respect to local consumption levels in
 Nigeria.

In a population of consumers with no-reported assets in Tanzania, non-durable

 Interpretations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 1.
 C5 says that higher price-non-food-expenditure suppresses w_food (individuals
 would decrease w_food when there is higher non-food area - so they move
 together with the food consumption).
 higher-price-food-expenditure on the other hand increases food weight (meaning
 consumers run to food when prices are higher).
 C6 suggests that consumers run to food more easily in TNZ - thus indicating
 more non-durable consumption in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 2.
 C3 says that older households have higher food consumption.
 C7 means that bigger households tend to have lower w_food than smaller
 households.
 Younger households have less w_food - meaning more non-durable consumption
 among younger people in both countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 3.
 D5 says high-food-expenditure-regions have lower non-durable consumption
 (again because food is more important).
 D5 also says that high-non-food-expenditure regions have a positive influence
 so the consumption does move together for non-food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 4.
 D2 says that asset-differences have a -ve influence on w_nonfood.
 Richer areas suppress non-food expenditure a lot in Tanzania.
 Urban areas actually push people to food.

[Granularity and Urban-rural differences] Notice that the granularity of
 aggregation is of key importance in our interpretation.
 There is no denying that income and occupation differences within levels
 finer than the district level may be relevant but the district-level aggregatio
n only allows us to understand wider regional disparities

The measure 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 does however consider the effect of urban and rural differences due to
 urban and rural disparities in wealth.
 If a consumer gains more status by owning a luxury car in the city than
 owning a tractor (which cost the same) in a village, our approach might
 not differentiate between the vehicle being a tractor or a luxury car but
 it does consider the asset in a rich area (city) and the poor area (village).

 goods which serve as consumer's endowments.
