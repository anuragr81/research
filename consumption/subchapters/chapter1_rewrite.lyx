Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status is a complex sociological phenomenon.
 Often viewed as a static trait that depends on family or identity, one
 can assume that it is fixed over any reasonable time period for an econometric
 study.
 The rapid changes in wealth in all industrialized countries however have
 made such traditional notions of status rather obsolete.
 Even though statisticians have not yet adopted a standard measurement criterion
 for socio-economic status, SES is often proxied with occupation, education,
 income and family relationships (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NCVHS,PsakiSeidman2013,DiemerMistry2013"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies in health and welfare have built wealth indices to model SES.
 Of particular interest is the use of asset indices that track assets owned
 during the lifetime to measure SES.
 Our goal in the current study is not to comment on the methodologies used
 in measuring SES but to understand how the factors driving socio-economic
 status can influence non-durable consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our definition of status does not deviate much from literature.
 Defined in terms of wealth and assets, SES is sensitive to rise in incomes
 and in asset ownership.
 If the accumulation of assets is rapid, it is likely to influence the non-durab
le consumption in the short run for a population of consumers as well.
 We thus explore the relationship of ownership of assets with non-durable
 consumption over time to explain its effect on what one may consider the
 status-related consumption in the developing countries.
 We believe that the intertemporal life-cycle model should link the two
 bodies of literature i) on socio-economic status measurement and ii) on
 conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We reject Veblen's notion of the futility of conspicuous consumption on
 grounds of measurability of consumption - arguing that the items of conspicuous
 consumption can bring status utility primarily by indicating the high assets
 worth of the owners of the such items (endowments and/or identities).
 The items of conspicuous consumption are futile in the sense only that
 they don't have any value except through the high net asset worth of their
 owners.
 With the definition of status in terms of occupation, education, assets
 and identity, we thus measure the changes in asset ownership with respect
 to age, income, region, occupation, education to answer how quickly the
 indicators of SES may change in a developing economy.

Literature Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement of SES in the literature has relied on education, occupation,
 income and family relationship.
 The researchers have often proxied SES with a wealth based index based
 on these parameters (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NCVHS,PsakiSeidman2013,DiemerMistry2013"

\end_inset

).
 The usage of PCA and similar techniques is common in such studies.
 Quite a few researchers have used asset indices to study non-durable consumptio
n for measurement of inequality and welfare (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013,McKenzie2005"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recording of assets ownership has been an important part of household
 surveys in the developing world.
 A few early studies on ownership of cars in the UK - for example - had
 used diffusion models to explain the proliferation of assets (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PyattDurable1964,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

).
 The introduction of electronic goods in the developing markets could also
 cause a similar proliferation of ownership and have an effect on the non-durabl
e consumption (through income and savings).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An econometric analysis of items that presumably improve the status of its
 buyer can lead to a tautological problem.
 If status-items are items that indicate the status of the buyer, then what
 conclusions are there to be derived from the observed high consumption
 on status items other than that the buyers of status items have high status?
 Such a paradox is resolved quickly by considering that status if formed
 through expectation of change in future based on the wealth accumulated
 from past generations.
 This problem has been addressed much before the introduction of game-theoretica
l approaches in microeconomics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Veblen's treatise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

 on conspicuous consumption one such work that has inspired many studies
 after itself.
 As such a study predates the times when household surveys were formalised
 in their post-war form, a lot of claims from Veblen (or on conspicuous
 consumption in the literature) are less obvious to verify.
 Veblen's claim of the futility as the character of conspicuous consumption
 is not alone in this regard.
 Much later, commenting on the post-war developments in the Western society,
 Frederich Hirsch has argued that the human needs have expanded manifolds
 since the time when Adam Smith's invisible hand was known to work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithAffluent"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the rich pursuing their interests while poor gain social mobility
 is an exchange that no longer work in the modern society as it did in Europe
 of the eighteenth century when the offer for social mobility was far more
 lucrative.
 THe changes in inequality can be verified quite easily with the data.
 The view of industrial developments as a legacy of the race amongst the
 middle classes to achieve the higher social positions once held by the
 feudal elite - is one that is shared by many economists and sociologists
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,SchumpeterCapitalism"

\end_inset

 - but there remains a lot in Hirsch's claims that is difficult to verify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hirsch goes on to suggest that status differentials were necessary to create
 new markets - where positional goods and advertisement have a major role
 to play.
 The model he suggests for positional competition is not a very quantitative
 one and is reproduced in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HirschsModel"

\end_inset

.
 With the physical scarcity of goods (food and amenities) largely conquered,
 he argued that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scarcity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes largely social in the developed countries.
 More commercialization (availability of previous unavailable items through
 money) leads to more scarcities and more competitions - hence instances
 of congestion (high demand with little chance of fulfilment) for a good
 develop - leading to increased status or positional competition in the
 society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key issue in developing an empirical understanding the relationship between
 congestion and scarcity is of semantic nature.
 Scarcity seems a more general concept than mere unavailability or low supply
 of an item - as it seems to entail both unavailability of the item and
 the competition for it.
 Hirsch does differentiate between the physical scarcity (unavailability)
 and social scarcity (competition) but he also concludes that the boundary
 between physical and social scarcities can get blurred as the positional
 goods create a market for themselves.
 It is difficult to measure scarcity for a product or a range of products
 when the term encompasses both the physical scarcity (unavailability) and
 the perceived scarcity (what we feel as scarce).
 A consumer may indeed feel that the item is scarce because she cannot afford
 it or because the supply of the item is limited through some other mechanism
 (i.e.
 barriers exist in the distribution of the item).
  While such felt scarcities appear relevant for consumption, we can only
 measure them relevant if they arise out of a relevant physical scarcity.
 Instead of attempting to define or measure felt scarcities themselves (as
 is done in a subject survey), we expand the notion of the physical scarcity
 to include barriers created through status competitions, advertising or
 other social-psychological communication that create the sense of urgent
 demand for a status-carrying good.
 The fusion of physical and social scarcities does not seem a mathematically
 tractable idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another notion difficult to find an econometric equivalent of is the “scarcity
 through overuse” (which is emphasized as the engine of social scarcity
 in the modern Western society).
 Ambiguous as it may seem, it is even less relevant in the developing world
 where there simply aren't enough items to be consumed (likely a case of
 physical scarcity - using Hirsch's terminology) and all overuse could continue
 to be a luxury.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even so, Hirsch's ideas of scarcity and congestion are relevant in the developin
g countries (scarcity being the lack of supply or unavailability of a particular
 commodity while congestion being the changes in income levels within social
 groups).
 The goal of status-related consumption in a developing economy - as much
 as anywhere else - is to allow a given population of individuals to associate
 themselves to those with perceived higher status (due to direct income
 or otherwise) in society.
 Due to the problems mentioned above, the measurement and verification of
 the cultural trends identified by both Hirsch and Veblen become far from
 trivial.
 Even if we were provided the access to a reliable microdata on consumption
 sampled over varied social identities and extending over a period of decades,
 it is difficult to track and measure the nature of connections between
 individuals and the influences social groups have on each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manski summarises the problem well with his remark that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the ambiguity of words permits a proliferation of concepts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Manski2000"

\end_inset

).
 It does appear that resolving ambiguities in terminology can make many
 social commentaries less compelling.
 Verbal reasoning - as Manski further elaborates - is less precise than
 mathematical argument
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Manski2000"

\end_inset

 even though it can be more evocative than the latter.
 One such example is Wilson's (1987) discussion of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

underclass
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Whenever economists have used the ideas of a social capital, they have
 often made several limiting assumptions about the group composition before
 analysis.
 For example, a study by Boijas (1991) claims that persons interact with
 members of their own ethnic group.
 Other studies interpret social capital in their own way - allowing the
 idea of social capital to remain a rather vague idea.
 Hirsch's claims too - we believe - do not need much scrutiny except for
 when econometric equivalence is sought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid the complexities of language and social observation, the behavioural
 sciences often design experiments where subjects can choose amongst well-define
d options.
 While it is difficult to scale up results from such smaller, often artificial,
 environments to higher levels of organisation in the society, such experiments
 remain an important tool to identify factors that have an impact on human
 motivations for consumption (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"

\end_inset

 for arguments both for and against this approach).
 While generalising results from such experiments in the wider population,
 there is the implicit assumption that the status competitions are inherent
 in all members of the population (so that a sample bias is ruled out).
 The arguments by Robert Frank seem pertinent to this assumption in that
 striving to achieve more than others may very well be ingrained in our
 hormones(see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

).
 Frank enumerates many empirical examples to support his arguments.
 Exploring incomes amongst professors competing for grants - for example
 - Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 notes that neither the Permanent Income model nor the productivity model
 explains the distribution of income.
 What offers a better explanation is the presence of status competition
 among the professors.
 Similarly, he demonstrates that in the absence of monopolies, it becomes
 difficult for corporations to survive by rewarding talent alone and they
 are thus compelled to depend on status competitions for income distribution

As we the focus on studying the expectation of asset ownership and expensive
 non-durable consumption for the purpose pf gaining status in the society,
 we are cautious of the extension of some of these ideas on conspicuous
 consumption in the developing world.
 While there is a wealth of literature that finds status competitions to
 have an effect on consumption (see

 in the studies.
 Table

 summarizes the data and methodologies for some of the studies.
 Many of the studies on conspicuous consumption have been based on a visible
 basket classified first by Heffetz - where the consumer basket constituents
 were sorted by a visibility measure based on a survey of 480 respondents.
 Conducted in US, the respondents were asked how long it took them to notice
 the consumption for commodities in the US CEX categories (listed in Table

Imagine that you meet a new person who lives in a household similar to yours.
 Imagine that their household is not different from other similar households,
 except that they like to, and do, spend more than average on [jewelry and

 Would you notice this about them, and if so, for how long would you have
 to have known them, to notice it? Would you notice it almost immediately
 upon meeting them for the first time, a short while after, a while after,
 only a long while after, or never?

The utility function is modeled as a combination of a private consumption
 function and an observable consumption function.
 Considering the Cobb-Douglas utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)=\beta_{v}\cdot f(v,w)+\beta_{w}ln(w)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $y=v+w$

\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is the budget constraint and 
\begin_inset Formula $(v$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $w)$
\end_inset

 are visible and non-visible good quantities respectively.
 Instead of the standard Engel curve model : 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\frac{{\beta}}{1+\beta}y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\frac{{1}}{1+\beta}y$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{{\beta_{v}}}{\beta_{w}})$
\end_inset

, the authors use the model provided by Ireland et al (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

).
 Using an individual's sensitivity to social status signals in the model,
 they use a utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)f(v,w)+af(\hat{v},\hat{w})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{v},\hat{w}$
\end_inset

 are societies' view of the consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

).
 Solving for a separating equilibrium, this results in 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{{1+\beta}}{a+\beta}+Cv^{-\frac{{\beta}}{a}}(a>0)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\frac{{a}}{a+\beta}(\frac{\beta}{1+\beta})^{\frac{{\beta}}{a}}b^{\frac{{a+\beta}}{a}}$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is derived by considering the utility maximization at lowest income level
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 as the boundary condition for the utility maximization problem).
 Elasticities in this model are 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{v}=\frac{{dv}}{dy}\cdot\frac{{y}}{v}=a((1+\beta)\frac{{v}}{y}-\beta)^{-1}$

We argue that a consumer survey must be used in order to measure visibility

Khamis et al

 ask two key questions to respondents in an online survey conducted in India.
 First asked them how closely they needed to interact with their neighbour
 (with similar demographic characteristics) in order to observe above average
 spending for a list of items (Options were -‘1: No Interaction’, ‘2: Occasional
 Interaction’, ‘3: Friend’, ‘4: Close Friend’ or ‘5: No matter how much
 one Interacts’).
 An item where >20% respondents report 1 or 2 was considered a visible item.
 A second question asked them what they'll expect of the consumption of
 an item after a sudden 20 percent rise in their neighbor's income ‘1: Fall’,
 ‘2: Stay the same’, ‘3: Increase by less than 20 percent’, ‘4: Increase
 by 20 percent’ or ‘5: Increase by more than 20 percent’.
 The list of items in these questions attempted to match the consumption
 categories in the IHDS.
 An item is associated with higher income if more than 20% of respondents
 reported 2,3,4 or 5.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Visibility is after all a socio-cultural judgment - and the visibility
 basket from the developed world cannot be translated as such into disparate
 geographies and cultural environments of the developing world.
 In fact one can arrive at severely inaccurate conclusions on visible consumptio
n for a consumer group if a visibility basket was chosen from a different
 cultural environment.
 For example, hair-products may be associated with a higher visibility (and
 promise) in the developed world but in the developing world their purpose
 could be just utilitarian (poor quality of production, cultural factors
 etc.).
 Attributing lower visible consumption based on a low consumption of hair-produc
ts would thus be erroneous.

Another practical problem arises in the developing world because of the
 predominant use of recall method in expenditure survey.
 A relevant anomaly is the Deaton Paxson paradox(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonPaxsonParadox"

\end_inset

) - i.e.
 the observed decrease in food expenditure per head as household size rises
 (with constant total outlay per head).
 The likely cause for the paradox is presence of errors correlated with
 household size in the data that results in possible overestimation of the
 consumption of recalled items
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonDeatonPaxson"

\end_inset

.
 Caution must therefore be taken (or a correction applied) when mixing expenditu
res from recall and diary methods (We note that the LSMS data on Tanzania
 records both diary and recall expenditures and we're careful not to stress
 on relative importance of one group vs the other while merging the respective
 expenditures).

While the visibility elasticities may not be compared across geographic
 boundaries without above considerations, a comparison within the country
 can provide insights into the effect of certain demographic factors on
 visible consumption (as long as the criteria of visibility is clear).
 This has been the central theme for most of the studies on conspicuous
 consumption surveyed.
 More than to improve the measurement of visibility, the studies are interested
 in identifying the demographic parameters that explain the log-expenditure
 of visibility basket as is.
 The general regression equation for such a study is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (accumulated over the chosen visibility basket), 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure.
 Households with higher total expenditure are far more likely to be those
 with higher visible expenditure.
 Thus, total expenditure (on the right side of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lnvis_regression-1"

\end_inset

) makes it an endogenous variable for the dependent variable : 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(vis_{i})$

 A different approach is taken by Jaikumar et al (2015) who use weights
 in the basket rather than visible expenditure levels - so that visible
 expenditure is not subject to the endogeneity problem that arises due to
 total expenditure being on the right hand side and visible expenditure
 on left hand side of the equation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"

\end_inset

 (The proportion of visible expenditure with respect to the total expenditure
 could be the same for those with higher total expenditure and lower total
 expenditure).
 However, since data on income is often poor or sparse in the developing
 countries, total expenditure turns out to be the most frequent choice for
 a proxy of permanent income (
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a key control parameter for the analysis of visible consumption).
 In most of the studies, the said endogeneity of total expenditure is resolved
 by a choice of appropriate instruments - e.g.
 income, cubic-income, positive-income dummies or occupation codes.
 These instruments identified by Charles et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

 are reported to be quite strong in the studies surveyed as part of this
 note (Sargan and Wu-Hausman tests confirm endogeneity and the effectiveness
 of chosen instruments).

A lot of studies have used the above framework to identify social factors
 that are relevant to difference in visible preferences.
 In India, these factors are religion and caste - while in South Africa
 and United States, race seems to have significance (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KausSA,CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

).
 The developing countries may also offer a less consumerist and less individuali
stic agrarian environment where mundane and seemingly unvaried expenditures
 (lesser number of status items) are more visible than in a relatively more
 individualistic and industrialized society.

For visibility to bear significance in an environment of severe inequalities

 Khamis et al

 therefore perform a slightly more detailed survey by asking what an individual
 whose consumption is noticed would do when her income rises (by 20%).
 This quantifies the expectation of how others infer the increases in total
 expenditure (income).
 The items where consumers expect the consumption to rise with increased
 income are those that associate with higher income and are declared

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In a developing economy, the criterion for status consumption is clearly
 not just noticeability any more.
 Visible consumption does detail the mechanics of status competitions in
 a narrower sense where consumers participate in a market to increase their
 perceived status - but it does not provide an adequate picture of status
 and consumption.
 One reason why other factors dominate is that markets are underdeveloped
 in the developing world and social status is largely yielded through severe-inc
ome differences and social strata.
 The second and probably more significant reason is that status signaling
 does not exist in a society as an inherent need for visible appeal amongst
 humans.
 Instead visible consumption matters because the item in consideration is
 associated with higher status (in the same sense that Veblen had talked
 about in his 19th century treatise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that the focus on visible consumption alone benefits from a
 key assumption based on Veblen's arguments - which is that conspicuous
 consumption is essentially futile - therefore the visible/status utility
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By assuming that a visible (or conspicuous) good serves no utility other
 than of status, we can be sure that the item in consideration does not
 have any utilitarian value and combine all the products in the visible
 category to talk about the status benefit that the consumer receives (see
 Corneo et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

can be separated from non-status utility - but this separability criterion
 verified in all of the literature around conspicuous consumption.
 An ardent follower of Veblen's may indeed find watches and makeup products
 as a social waste and eventually 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

futile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but it is difficult to argue that housing or shoes too would only offer
 status benefits.
 Our view is that consumers don't buy an item purely for status needs -
 more so in the developing countries.
 Instead of limiting ourselves to visible consumption as the particular
 mechanics of status signaling - where consumers buy items in a common market
 and (presumably) over-weigh on items that are more noticeable - we attempt
 to understand how reasons such as unavailability of items and disparities
 of services across regions could influence the needs of consumers with
 respect to the desire to achieve status through non-durable consumption
 and assets.

The first econometric study that was undertaken with a panel data of savings
 and income was by Duesenberry (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Duesenberry1949"

\end_inset

)- who had noticed disparate savings ratios amongst social groups in one
 of tshe first econometric studies on status-related consumption (before
 Milton Friedman addressed the same problem with the permanent income hypothesis
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"

\end_inset

).
 Even though Veblen's (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

) view of status involving items of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

futility
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was not shared by Duesensberry either, we find that Veblen's view of status
 consumption as a combination (or balance) of two opposing tendencies could
 be useful for modeling purposes.
 These are the tendencies of a consumer i) to distinguish oneself from others
 and ii) to follow others - that have been described by the snob and bandwagon
 effects in more recent literature (Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

).
 It is easy to obfuscate these two opposing tendencies by asserting that
 both the tendencies exist in individuals at the same time - a claim that
 would  make the measurement of status-consumption rather impossible.
 On the other hand, by attempting to measure the relative importance of
 the two tendencies that are reflected in habits and expenditure over the
 lifetime, it is possible to see to what extent the stock purchases and
 non-durable expenditure are influenced by socio-economic status.
 In more technical terms, we set ourselves to find how well a life-cycle
 model could explain the change in savings rate of individuals over the
 life-time in the Tanzanian market and whether quality measurements of the
 purchases of the non-durable items would change with asset ownership over
 their lifetime.

Model for Status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model is quite similar to one used by Coreno et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 - one that considers a ranking function for every individual so that consumptio
n is seen as a way to transform the income ranking of a population i.e.
 individuals improve their perception in society through consumption to
 overcome their income rank in the society.
 It can be argued that anyone in less than the highest income group (more
 specifically -the highest quantile of the all status determinants minus
 that of consumption) would benefit from a short-term expense on status-related
 consumption.
 Therefore, if conspicuous consumption does exist in a society, one can
 claim that the rank of expenditure on expendable items (or utility) and
 assets rank (or utility) must differ for the consumers in medium quantiles
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This verification may serve as the test of conspicuous consumption (the
 inference is equivalent to one that can be drawn from the permanent income
 elasticity of consumption of a certain item within different quantiles
 of a population).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 An econometric method can be derived from a status utility decomposed into
 the status utility through asset ownership and consumption of high-price
 items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, the status ranking that is imparted to an individual can
 be seen as a combination of a ranking of expenses on non-durable items
 and that of asset ownership.
 A key difference in our model is that unlike in the Ireland and Corneo
 models, we assume that all consumption items can impart status and focus
 on assets and high-priced items.
 The empirical problems of finding a clear boundary between conspicuous
 and non-conspicuous items is thus circumvented by relying on price and
 long-term ownership as the key determinants of status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An analysis of the time-series data across multiple geographies (e.g.
 a quantile regression on a time-series of purchases across several income
 quantiles of the population) can further test whether consumers with different
 income ranks within a society do engage in pecuniary emulation or not.
 For now, however, we limit our focus on a cross-sectional analysis of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To calibrate a status utility function one can either split the consumer
 basket into positional (status) and non-positional (non-status) items (as
 is done in most of empirical work) or assign a status-utility to every
 commodity in the basket.
 For reasons discussed in the sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ScarcityAndVisibility"

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Status-and-asset-ownership"

\end_inset

, we choose the latter option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consequence of assigning status potential to all items in the model is
 that the status utility can no longer be viewed as separable overall from
 the non-status part of utility (there are no purely status goods any more).
 In this preliminary model used for the empirical work, the consumer utility
 (comprising of status and non-status utility) is considered separable across
 functional groups such as food, energy, entertainment etc.
 in the usual sense - and the status items are chosen by the consumer within
 each category instead of as a separate category.
 This can be viewed as a two-state budgeting model for the separable functional
 groups - wherein the representative consumer first allocates money to be
 spent for the different functional categories (food, energy, etc.) and the
 overall status - before deciding on which status items to buy within each
 category (in food, energy, entertainment etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snob and bandwagon items - although not strictly equivalent to the two
 balancing tendencies of the consumer to buy assets and high-priced non-durable
 items - can also be understood in the model.
 The representative consumer chooses a snob item to protect her position
 in the societal ranking and use a bandwagon item to promote herself in
 the ranking.
 Both non-durable items and assets can be of snob or bandwagon type.
 It is the relative positioning in the social ranking - we argue - that
 determines whether a new item is snob or bandwagon type.
 For a particular consumer, the goal of protecting one's rank with a snob
 item is achieved by choosing the higher priced items in a category (thus
 entering a barrier to status) and the goal of advancing one's rank is achieved
 by acquiring an asset that associates oneself to someone who has a higher
 rank (thus directly acquiring an asset) .
 The consumer balances between the tendency to choose non-durable expenditure
 for an asset that is not affordable with that of expenditure on durable
 assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we decompose status utility into several functional categories, we also
 need to detail how choices for status in every functional category combine
 into the final status utility.
 In the long-run, we argue that the representative consumer develops a preferenc
e order of functional groups - food may become less important than housing
 and personal products etc.
 (as is indeed observed by the literature on visible consumption).
 At any given time, therefore, the representative consumer allocates her
 expenditure based on this preference of categories.
 The final status utility is aggregated over all the separable categories.
 For example, a consumer could acquire status by decorating his house or
 buying expensive cigars.
 Both housing and entertainment provide utility in the usual sense but paintings
 and cigars enhance status by letting the consumer derive status sub-utility
 from both housing and entertainment.
 The aggregation of sub-utilities in the categories is assumed to be linear
 - so that the total status utility is a weighted sum of status derived
 from every category.
 More details on this are provided in a later chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status in this model is thus influenced predominantly by the price differences
 (let's call it 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

) and asset distribution (let's call it 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

).
 The effect of changes in prices, introduction of new items and visibility
 preferences are all through 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

.
 The mechanisms are affecting status are discussed in the next subsections.

Effect of Price differences and supply issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Price differentiation in the market matters for the way a consumer sets
 herself apart from others through selection of higher-priced items.
 The more the price differentiation exists within a functional category,
 higher is the likelihood for the consumers to indicate status through purchase
 of higher priced item.
 If markets of items are perfect and differences in status as well as prices
 exist in an economy, then it is certain that those with higher purchasing
 power would attempt to maintain their status with the purchase of higher
 priced items.
 Wherever available, price serves as an indicator of whether an item can
 exhibit any status or not.
 The lack of detailed price information in a survey (and/or unsuitability
 of using prices inferred from cost-quantity due to severe measurement errors
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In absence of observed prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}$
\end_inset

, one can instead estimate prices as 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{A}/q_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{B}/q_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 However, one cannot rely on total quantity (
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

) consumed of an item or the expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $(e=q\cdot p)$
\end_inset

 on the item alone as a metric of status-carrying-potential since it obfuscates
 the sense of status consumption.
 If for example, a consumer accumulates cheaper varieties of the an item
 instead of accumulating the higher priced varieties of the item, the comparison
 of quantities would no longer provide an accurate representation of the
 status-related consumption.
 If the prices of an item are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}(where\ p_{1}>p_{2})$
\end_inset

 - which can be consumed by 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}\cdot q_{A}<p_{2}\cdot q_{B}$
\end_inset

 s(or 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{A}<e_{B})$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{A}<q_{B}$
\end_inset

, consumer B accumulates cheaper varieties of the item.
 If we don't observe 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}$
\end_inset

 directly but observe the total consumption on the item by 
\begin_inset Formula $A(=e_{A})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, then even 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{A}<e_{B}$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily imply that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 derives less status than 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 by consuming the variants of the same item.
\end_layout

\end_inset

) does present limitations to this measure - but one can inspect the distributio
n of usage of expensive options for a category of items to understand the
 how much status the representative consumer may derive with the choice
 for expensive items in a category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given our earlier discussion on scarcity, a clarification must be made about
 consumption item's rareness - which in itself does not imply scarcity of
 the item.
 For example, maternity products or musical instruments would always be
 limited to a certain section of the population - but they become a status
 product 
\shape italic
only
\shape default
 if there are low-price substitutes that exist for them.
 Therefore, an item's low distribution counts towards status only as long
 as it can be viewed as superior to other substitutes (through price if
 the markets exist for the category).
 The availability of an item (all supply issues) are incorporated in 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that participation of consumers in the same market is key in
 the view of the status advantage through price differences.
 Certain items may have higher price varieties due to transport costs -
 so if the markets where consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 participate are affected by different supply-side issues then it would
 be erroneous to consider status differences on grounds of price differences
 observed by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 All supply-side issues are to be considered as barriers to status (which
 can either improve or affect status) - i.e.
 being in a region, neighborhood or social network where certain commodities
 are exclusively available, a consumer may be imparted status advantage
 (or disadvantage).
 It makes sense therefore to think of the gain (loss) of status by being
 in a region where more items are available (unavailable).
 When comparing two consumers in different areas 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 where a commodity is both available and consumed in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 (but not in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

), the status impact of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 should adjust the utility enhancing factor (through a Heckmann selection
 or otherwise).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue of availability - which we later explain - is particularly relevant
 in the developing countries since the rural areas are faced with unavailability
 of services and goods that are available (although limited) in the urban
 areas.
 Indeed, such unavailability can spiral into severe demand pressures through
 pressures on urban migration.
 In the data from Tanzania, for example, we find not only that the region
 dummies are significant in consumption of certain items in the survey (particul
arly with respect to such as electricity which is completely unavailable
 in large parts of the country).
 The availability of electricity seems to transform the income elasticities
 of demand for other expenditures as well (e.g.
 marriage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\size normal
Effect of the distribution of assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That acquiring long-term assets is the surest way to ascertain one's status
 in society is one of the key assumptions of our model for status
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The definition of asset is driven by consumer's intent of permanent ownership.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For others to associate with such asset owners, the consumers are likely
 to own what they may fit within their budget.
 Despite the same monthly expenditure, for example, rented housing for the
 same cost may carry more status simply because the houses that are less
 affordable to own can be made affordable by offering as rental housing.
 Thus market forces presenting the consumer with cheaper substitutes can
 facilitate the status need fulfillment.
 In the case of housing (or transport etc.
 as the case may be) the consumer doesn't need to own the house (i.e.
 she does not need to pay the full-price of the item desired) but is able
 to signal more status than through owning a less expensive house (item)
 by simply renting the house (or the respective item).
 In general, wherever posed with the choice between owning and consuming
 the same item, the consumers may prefer to fulfill short-term status needs
 (in hope of future mobility) instead of owning either a high-price asset
 (which would require saving until a longer time) or a lower-priced asset
 (which would have significantly lower status advantage).
 This is simply because the markets may address status needs sooner than
 they address long-term needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While our preference for understanding status consumption as the owning
 assets and short-term consumption is more measurable than the difference
 between status and non-status items, we are aware that the difference between
 assets and monthly consumption is not without problems.
 For example, the status utility from monthly expenditure and that from
 owning assets are not always independent of one another.
 There would always exist items for monthly consumption that are either
 closely related or are substitutes of the corresponding owned assets.
 The status utility from electricity in a developing country, for example,
 would be achieved not only by having access to electricity but also (and
 more so) by running other appliances that depend on electricity.
 More expenditure on electricity doesn't derive so status by itself as it
 does by letting the consumer use owned or rented assets that run on electricity.
 The status utility (or ranking) from monthly expenditure therefore depends
 very much on the related assets in such a case.
 In case of mortgages, as another example, the boundary between asset ownership
 and monthly expenditure gets blurred.
 The status utility from assets and consumption cannot be considered separable
 (or independent of each other) in the model of status based on assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issues of supply (availability) are prevalent in assets as well.
 As the consumption of a lot of items are dependent on each other - thus
 they are forgone collectively.
 In other words, the status disadvantage from not consuming an item 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may add up towards the disadvantage from not consuming 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 if the consumption on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is dependent on consuming the item 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the status disadvantage from not consuming electricity may
 include the disadvantage of not having AC, stereo speakers etc.
 In reality, when the consumers in an area don't have access to electricity,
 they lose collectively in the status hierarchy simply by being residents
 of the region.
 In such a case, it's there is simply no opportunity to overspend on electricity
 to emulate those who have electricity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\size normal
Effect of Visibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that a consumer establishes the preference of categories for status
 consumption over a longer period of time.
 The consumer may still decide to spend more on food if she couldn't find
 a way to differentiate status in housing, but whether the degree to how
 much she would spend is fixed over time.
 This is aligned with the literature on visible consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

 - which notices consumers' significant response to visible category of
 items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the asset based model is not concerned with the differences in visibility
 of items within a functional category, the measurement of visibility index
 (as employed by Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

 and Khamis et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia"

\end_inset

) is not relevant to the analysis of demand.
 In other words, we are not concerned with whether items within a functional
 group are more or less visible with respect to each other - hence the differenc
e between values of a visibility index for shampoo and that for body-oil
 is rather irrelevant for the model.
 The idea of visibility is incorporated only in the preference for visibility
 that exists for functional categories (food,energy, housing etc.).
 While clothes could be deemed more visible than an investment policy -
 a more specific order of visibility within a category (e.g.
 shampoo vs body-oil) is unimportant.

Price changes over time and introduction of new items
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is possible to study the supply issues in a cross-section analysis,
 we do need a time-series of data to study the effect of prices and the
 consumer response to how products are introduced over time (see Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

, Bonus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BonusAssetsDiffusion"

\end_inset

).
 Indeed in an environment of rapid economic growth, the introduction of
 new commodities that are not guarded by traditional social networks can
 create unprecedented demand pressures.
 In the sub-Saharan African countries, the electronic goods, cars, education
 or media can be items whose bandwagon effects can counteract the snob effects
 from owning land and other assets.
 In all the time-series work which we later take upon, the market is assumed
 to be able to price a status commodity fairly (i.e.
 the new items introduced would have a price reflecting their status advantage),
 then new entrant must have price higher than that of other varieties of
 the item category.

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any

 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

.
 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{skincreamconsu}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that
 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.
