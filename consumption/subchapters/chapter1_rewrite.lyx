Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status is a complex sociological phenomenon.
 Often viewed as a static trait that depends on family or identity, one
 can assume that it is fixed over any reasonable time period for an econometric
 study.
 The rapid changes in wealth in all industrialized countries however have
 made such traditional notions of status rather obsolete.
 In the most recent research in health, sociology and economics, status
 is measured or proxied with characteristics that change over time such
 as occupation, education and income(see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NCVHS,PsakiSeidman2013,DiemerMistry2013"

\end_inset

 for a review).
 Family relationships or the social class are no longer adequate - statistically
 speaking - to explain the notion of socio-economic status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies in health and welfare have built wealth indices to model SES.
 Of particular interest is the use of asset indices that track assets owned
 during the lifetime to measure SES (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013,McKenzie2005"

\end_inset

).
 Our goal in the current study is not to comment on the methodologies used
 in measuring SES but to understand how the assets and characteristics that
 determine the socio-economic status can influence non-durable consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our definition of status does not deviate much from the surveyed literature.
 Defined in terms of education, occupation, income and assets, SES is sensitive
 to rise in incomes and in asset ownership.
 If the accumulation of assets is rapid, it is likely to influence the non-durab
le consumption in the short run for a population of consumers.
 We believe that an intertemporal life-cycle model should continue to link
 the two bodies of literature i) on socio-economic status measurement and
 ii) on conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to do so, we feel the need to discount Veblen's notion of the futility
 of conspicuous consumption on grounds of measurability of consumption -
 arguing that the items of conspicuous consumption can bring status utility
 primarily by indicating the high assets worth of the owners of the such
 items (endowments and/or identities) and thus they are not futile for the
 purposes of utility.
 One may consider them futile only in the sense that they don't have any
 value except through the high net asset worth of their owners.
 With the definition of status in terms of occupation, education, assets
 and identity, we measure the changes in asset ownership with respect to
 age, income, region, occupation, education only to answer how quickly the
 changes in indicators of SES can develop and possibly affect non-durable
 consumption.

Literature Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement of SES in the literature has relied on education, occupation,
 income and family relationships.
 The researchers have often proxied SES with a wealth based index based
 on these parameters (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NCVHS,PsakiSeidman2013,DiemerMistry2013"

\end_inset

).
 The usage of PCA and similar techniques is common in such studies.
 Quite a few researchers have used asset indices to study non-durable consumptio
n for measurement of inequality and welfare (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013,McKenzie2005"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recording of assets ownership has been an important part of household
 surveys in both the developed and developing world.
 A few early studies on ownership of cars in the UK - for example - had
 used diffusion models to explain the proliferation of assets (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PyattDurable1964,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

).
 The introduction of electronic goods in the developing markets could also
 cause a similar proliferation of ownership and have an effect on the non-durabl
e consumption (through income and savings).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An econometric analysis of items that presumably improve the status of its
 buyer are prone to lead to a known tautological problem in demand analysis.
 If status-items are items that indicate the status of the buyer, then what
 conclusions are there to be derived from the observed high consumption
 on status items other than that the buyers of status items have high status?
 Such a paradox is quickly resolved by considering that the notions of status
 develop through expectation of change in future based on the wealth accumulated
 from past generations.
 This problem has been addressed by economists much before the introduction
 of game-theoretical approaches in microeconomics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Veblen's treatise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

 on conspicuous consumption is one such work which has inspired many studies
 - explaining most recently how the marginalised or minority communities
 spend differently on status items.
 However, as Veblen's ideas predate the times when household surveys were
 formalised in their post-war form, a lot of claims from Veblen (or on conspicuo
us consumption in the literature) are less obvious to verify.
 The concept of the futility of items of conspicuous consumption is not
 alone in this regard.
 Much later, commenting on the post-war developments in the Western society,
 Frederich Hirsch has argued that the human needs have expanded manifolds
 since the time when Adam Smith's invisible hand was known to work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithAffluent"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the rich pursuing their interests while poor gain social mobility
 is an exchange that no longer works in the modern society as it did in
 Europe of the eighteenth century.
 The changes in inequality in this case can be easily verified with the
 data and this view of industrial developments as a legacy of the race amongst
 the middle classes to achieve the higher social positions once held by
 the feudal elite - is one that is shared by many historians, economists
 and sociologists 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,SchumpeterCapitalism"

\end_inset

.
 Still, there remains a lot in Hirsch's claims that is difficult to verify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hirsch goes on to suggest that status differentials were necessary to create
 new markets - where positional goods and advertisement have a major role
 to play (see the model suggested for positional competition in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HirschsModel"

\end_inset

).
 With the physical scarcity of goods (food and amenities) largely conquered,
 he argued that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scarcity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes largely social in the developed countries.
 More commercialization (availability of previous unavailable items through
 money) leads to more scarcities and more competitions - hence instances
 of congestion (high demand with little chance of fulfilment) for a good
 develop - leading to increased status or positional competition in the
 society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key issue in developing an empirical understanding of the relationship
 between congestion and scarcity is of semantic nature.
 Scarcity seems a more general concept than mere unavailability or low supply
 of an item - as it seems to entail both unavailability of the item and
 the competition for it.
 Hirsch does differentiate between the physical scarcity (unavailability)
 and social scarcity (competition) but he also concludes that the boundary
 between physical and social scarcities can get blurred as the positional
 goods create a market for themselves.
 It is difficult to measure scarcity for a product or a range of products
 when the term encompasses both the physical scarcity (unavailability) and
 the perceived scarcity (what we feel as scarce).
 A consumer may indeed feel that the item is scarce because she cannot afford
 it or because the supply of the item is limited through some other mechanism
 (i.e.
 barriers exist in the distribution of the item) but while such felt scarcities
 appear relevant for consumption, we can only measure them relevant if they
 arise out of a relevant physical scarcity.
 Instead of attempting to define or measure felt scarcities themselves (as
 may be done in a subjective survey), we can expand the notion of the physical
 scarcity to include barriers created through status competitions, advertising
 or other social-psychological communication that create the sense of urgent
 demand for a status-carrying good.
 The fusion of physical and social scarcities however still does appear
 to be a tractable idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another notion difficult to find an econometric equivalent of is the “scarcity
 through overuse” (which is emphasized as the engine of social scarcity
 in the modern Western society).
 Ambiguous as it may seem, it is even less relevant in the developing world
 where there simply aren't enough items to be consumed (likely a case of
 physical scarcity - using Hirsch's terminology) and all overuse could continue
 to be a luxury.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even so, Hirsch's ideas of scarcity and congestion are relevant in the developin
g countries (scarcity being interpreted as the lack of supply or unavailability
 of a particular commodity while congestion being the changes in income
 levels within social groups).
 The goal of status-related consumption in a developing economy - as much
 as anywhere else - is to allow a given population of individuals to associate
 themselves to those with perceived higher status (due to direct income
 or otherwise) in society.
 Despite the relevance of many of the ideas of Veblen and Hirsch, the measuremen
t and verification of the cultural trends identified by them are far from
 trivial due to the issues outlined above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manski summarises such problems well with his remark that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the ambiguity of words permits a proliferation of concepts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Manski2000"

\end_inset

).
 It does appear that resolving ambiguities in terminology can make many
 social commentaries less compelling.
 Verbal reasoning - as Manski further elaborates - is less precise than
 mathematical argument
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Manski2000"

\end_inset

 even though it can be more evocative than the latter.
 One such example is Wilson's (1987) discussion of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

underclass
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Manski2000"

\end_inset

.
 In general, as Manski finds, when the economists have used the ideas of
 a social capital, they have made several limiting assumptions about the
 group composition before analysis.
 For example, a study by Boijas (1991) claims that persons interact with
 members of their own ethnic group.
 Other studies interpret social capital in their own way - allowing the
 idea of social capital to remain a rather vague concept.
 Hirsch's claims too - therefore - need not be scrutinised much except for
 the search of their econometric equivalence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid the complexities of language and social observation, the behavioural
 sciences often design experiments where subjects can choose amongst well-define
d options.
 While it is difficult to scale up results from such smaller, often artificial,
 environments to higher levels of organisation in the society, such experiments
 remain an important tool to identify factors that have an impact on human
 motivations for consumption (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016"

\end_inset

 for arguments both for and against this approach).
 While generalising results from such experiments in the wider population,
 there is the implicit assumption that the status competitions are inherent
 in all members of the population (so that a sample bias is ruled out).
 The arguments by Robert Frank seem pertinent to this assumption in that
 striving to achieve more than others may very well be ingrained in our
 hormones(see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

).
 Frank enumerates many empirical examples to support his arguments.
 Exploring incomes amongst professors competing for grants - for example
 - Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"

\end_inset

 notes that neither the Permanent Income model nor the productivity model
 explains the distribution of income.
 What offers a better explanation is the presence of status competition
 among the professors.
 Similarly, he demonstrates that in the absence of monopolies, it becomes
 difficult for corporations to survive by rewarding talent alone and they
 are thus compelled to depend on status competitions for income distribution

As we the focus on studying the expectation of asset ownership and expensive
 non-durable consumption for the purpose of gaining status in the society,
 we are cautious of the extension of some of these ideas on conspicuous
 consumption in the developing world.
 While there is a wealth of literature that finds status competitions to
 have an effect on consumption (see

,

 Table

 Many of the studies on conspicuous consumption have been based on a visible
 basket classified first by Heffetz - where the consumer basket constituents
 were sorted by a visibility measure based on a survey of 480 respondents.
 Conducted in the US, the respondents were asked how long it took them to
 notice the consumption for commodities in the US CEX categories (listed
 in Table

 to have known them, to notice it? Would you notice it almost immediately
 upon meeting them for the first time, a short while after, a while after,

The utility function is modeled as a combination of a private consumption
 function and an observable consumption function.
 Considering the Cobb-Douglas utility function

 are visible and non-visible good quantities respectively.
 Instead of the standard Engel curve model : 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\frac{{\beta}}{1+\beta}y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\frac{{1}}{1+\beta}y$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{{\beta_{v}}}{\beta_{w}})$
\end_inset

, the authors use the model provided by Ireland et al (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ireland_signals"

).
 Using an individual's sensitivity to social status signals in the model,
 they use a utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)f(v,w)+af(\hat{v},\hat{w})$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{v},\hat{w}$
\end_inset

 are societies' view of the consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

).
 Solving for a separating equilibrium, this results in 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{{1+\beta}}{a+\beta}+Cv^{-\frac{{\beta}}{a}}(a>0)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\frac{{a}}{a+\beta}(\frac{\beta}{1+\beta})^{\frac{{\beta}}{a}}b^{\frac{{a+\beta}}{a}}$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is derived by considering the utility maximization at lowest income level
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$

 as the boundary condition for the utility maximization problem).

 ask two key questions to respondents in an online survey conducted in India.
 First asked them how closely they needed to interact with their neighbour
 (with similar demographic characteristics) in order to observe above average
 spending for a list of items (Options were -‘1: No Interaction’, ‘2: Occasional
 Interaction’, ‘3: Friend’, ‘4: Close Friend’ or ‘5: No matter how much
 one Interacts’).
 An item where >20% respondents report 1 or 2 was considered a visible item.
 A second question asked them what they'll expect of the consumption of
 an item after a sudden 20 percent rise in their neighbor's income ‘1: Fall’,
 ‘2: Stay the same’, ‘3: Increase by less than 20 percent’, ‘4: Increase
 by 20 percent’ or ‘5: Increase by more than 20 percent’.
 The list of items in these questions attempted to match the consumption
 categories in the IHDS.
 An item is associated with higher income if more than 20% of respondents
 reported 2,3,4 or 5.

.
 Visibility is after all a socio-cultural judgment - and the visibility
 basket from the developed world cannot be translated as such into disparate
 geographies and cultural environments of the developing world.
 In fact one can arrive at severely inaccurate conclusions on visible consumptio
n for a consumer group if a visibility basket was chosen from a different
 cultural environment.
 For example, hair-products may be associated with a higher visibility (and
 promise) in the developed world but in the developing world their purpose
 could be just utilitarian (poor quality of production, cultural factors
 etc.).
 Attributing lower visible consumption based on a low consumption of hair-produc
ts would thus be erroneous.

Another practical problem arises in the developing world because of the
 predominant use of recall method in expenditure survey.
 A relevant anomaly is the Deaton Paxson paradox(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonPaxsonParadox"

\end_inset

) - i.e.
 the observed decrease in food expenditure per head as household size rises
 (with constant total outlay per head).
 The likely cause for the paradox is presence of errors correlated with
 household size in the data that results in possible overestimation of the
 consumption of recalled items
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonDeatonPaxson"

\end_inset

.
 Caution must therefore be taken (or a correction applied) when mixing expenditu
res from recall and diary methods (We note that the LSMS data on Tanzania
 records both diary and recall expenditures and we're careful not to stress
 on relative importance of one group vs the other while merging the respective
 expenditures).

While the visibility elasticities may not be compared across geographic
 boundaries without above considerations, a comparison within the country
 can provide insights into the effect of certain demographic factors on
 visible consumption (as long as the criteria of visibility is clear).
 This has been the central theme for most of the studies on conspicuous
 consumption surveyed.
 More than to improve the measurement of visibility, the studies are interested
 in identifying the demographic parameters that explain the log-expenditure
 of visibility basket as is.
 The general regression equation for such a study is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (accumulated over the chosen visibility basket), 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure.
 Households with higher total expenditure are far more likely to be those
 with higher visible expenditure.
 Thus, total expenditure (on the right side of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lnvis_regression-1"

\end_inset

) makes it an endogenous variable for the dependent variable : 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(vis_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 A different approach is taken by Jaikumar et al (2015) who use weights
 in the basket rather than visible expenditure levels - so that visible
 expenditure is not subject to the endogeneity problem that arises due to
 total expenditure being on the right hand side and visible expenditure
 on left hand side of the equation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"

\end_inset

 (The proportion of visible expenditure with respect to the total expenditure
 could be the same for those with higher total expenditure and lower total
 expenditure).
 However, since data on income is often poor or sparse in the developing
 countries, total expenditure turns out to be the most frequent choice for
 a proxy of permanent income (
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a key control parameter for the analysis of visible consumption).
 In most of the studies, the said endogeneity of total expenditure is resolved
 by a choice of appropriate instruments - e.g.
 income, cubic-income, positive-income dummies or occupation codes.
 These instruments identified by Charles et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

 are reported to be quite strong in the studies surveyed as part of this
 note (Sargan and Wu-Hausman tests confirm endogeneity and the effectiveness
 of chosen instruments).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of studies have used the above framework to identify social factors
 that are relevant to difference in visible preferences.
 In India, these factors are religion and caste - while in South Africa
 and United States, race seems to have significance (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KausSA,CharlesHurstRace,OmoriSmithVisRace"

\end_inset

).
 The developing countries may also offer a less consumerist and less individuali
stic agrarian environment where mundane and seemingly unvaried expenditures
 (lesser number of status items) are more visible than in a relatively more
 individualistic and industrialized society.
\end_layout

For visibility to bear significance in an environment of severe inequalities

 Khamis et al

 therefore perform a slightly more detailed survey by asking what an individual
 whose consumption is noticed would do when her income rises (by 20%).
 This quantifies the expectation of how others infer the increases in total
 expenditure (income).
 The items where consumers expect the consumption to rise with increased
 income are those that associate with higher income and are declared

In a developing economy, the criterion for status consumption is clearly
 not just noticeability any more.
 Visible consumption does detail the mechanics of status competitions in
 a narrower sense where consumers participate in a market to increase their
 perceived status - but it does not provide an adequate picture of status
 and consumption.
 One reason why other factors dominate is that markets are underdeveloped
 in the developing world and social status is largely yielded through severe-inc
ome differences and social strata.
 The second and probably more significant reason is that status signaling
 does not exist in a society as an inherent need for visible appeal amongst
 humans.
 Instead visible consumption matters because the item in consideration is
 associated with higher status (in the same sense that Veblen had talked
 about in his 19th century treatise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that the focus on visible consumption alone benefits from a
 key assumption based on Veblen's arguments - which is that conspicuous
 consumption is essentially futile - therefore the visible/status utility
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By assuming that a visible (or conspicuous) good serves no utility other
 than of status, we can be sure that the item in consideration does not
 have any utilitarian value and combine all the products in the visible
 category to talk about the status benefit that the consumer receives (see
 Corneo et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

can be separated from non-status utility - but this separability criterion
 verified in all of the literature around conspicuous consumption.
 An ardent follower of Veblen may indeed find watches and makeup products
 as a social waste and eventually 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

futile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but it is difficult to argue that housing or shoes too would only offer
 status benefits.
 Our view is that consumers don't buy an item purely for status needs -
 more so in the developing countries.
 Instead of limiting ourselves to visible consumption as the particular
 mechanics of status signaling - where consumers buy items in a common market
 and (presumably) over-weigh on items that are more noticeable - we attempt
 to understand how reasons such as unavailability of items and disparities
 of services across regions could influence the needs of consumers with
 respect to the desire to achieve status through non-durable consumption
 and assets.

The first econometric study that was undertaken with a panel data of savings
 and income was by Duesenberry (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Duesenberry1949"

\end_inset

)- who had noticed disparate savings ratios amongst social groups in one
 of tshe first econometric studies on status-related consumption (before
 Milton Friedman addressed the same problem with the permanent income hypothesis
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"

\end_inset

).
 Even though Veblen's (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

) view of status involving items of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

futility
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was not shared by Duesensberry either, we find that Veblen's view of status
 consumption as a combination (or balance) of two opposing tendencies could
 be useful for modeling purposes.
 These are the tendencies of a consumer i) to distinguish oneself from others
 and ii) to follow others
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Veblen has articulated these tendencies as that of invidious comparison
 and pecuniary emulation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - that have been described by the snob and bandwagon effects in more recent
 literature (Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

).
 It is easy to obfuscate these two opposing tendencies by asserting that
 both the tendencies exist in individuals at the same time - a claim that
 would  make the measurement of status-consumption rather impossible.
 On the other hand, by attempting to measure the relative importance of
 the two tendencies that are reflected in habits and expenditure over the
 lifetime, it is possible to see to what extent the stock purchases and
 non-durable expenditure are influenced by socio-economic status.
 In more technical terms, we set ourselves to find how well a life-cycle
 model could explain the change in savings rates of individuals over the
 life-time and whether quality measurements of the purchases of the non-durable
 items would change with asset ownership over their lifetime.

A model for measurement of status-related consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 - one that considers a ranking function for every individual so that consumptio
n is seen as a way to transform the income ranking of a population i.e.
 individuals improve their perception in society through consumption to
 overcome their income rank in the society.
 It can be argued that anyone in less than the highest income group (more
 specifically -the highest quantile of the all status determinants minus
 that of consumption) would benefit from a short-term expense on status-related
 nondurable consumption.
 Therefore, if conspicuous consumption does exist in a society, one can
 claim that the rank of expenditure on nondurable items (or utility) and
 assets rank (or utility) must differ for the consumers in medium quantiles.
 The status ranking that is imparted to an individual can be seen as a combinati
on of a ranking of expenses on non-durable items and that of asset ownership.
 Unlike in the Ireland and Corneo models, we assume that all consumption
 items can potentially impart status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clarification in terminology is due here - particularly since we have
 stated that we don't consider conspicuous consumption as futile.
 A status item for us in an item that can change the status of an individual
 by increasing the 
\shape italic
\size small
likelihood
\shape default
\size default
 of improving status over the long-run - which continues to be determined
 by education, occupation, assets and family interactions.
 Non-durable consumption in this model could be either completely futile
 from a status point of view or it must have a direct influence on status.
 In the model we intend to set up, the non-durable consumption is only futile
 in long-run since it doesn't improve long-run ownership of assets or change
 in social interactions.
 We believe that the utility of conspicuous consumption lies only in increasing
 the likelihood of social interactions with those with better status- letting
 the model parameters change of asset growth be a function of non-durable
 consumption.
 Therefore, we don't completely reject Veblen's idea of futility of conspicuous
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical problems of finding a clear boundary between conspicuous and
 non-conspicuous items are thus also circumvented by relying on expensive
 nondurable consumption and long-term ownership as the key determinants
 of status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also intend to indicate that the snob and bandwagon items can also be
 understood in terms of the asset-based model.
 A consumer chooses a snob item to protect her position in the societal
 ranking and a bandwagon item to promote herself in the ranking.
 Both non-durable items and assets can therefore be of snob or bandwagon
 type.
 It is the consumer's relative positioning in the social ranking that determines
 whether a new item she purchases is snob or bandwagon type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are hence two levels of substitiution in the mdoel.
 First is the substitution between assets and non-durable consumption.
 The further substitution at the finer level exists between within categories
 of non-durable consumption - each of which offer an expensive variety for
 consumption.
 As an example, the former substitution could be between saving for furniture
 and overspending on clothes while the latter could be between consuming
 cheaper grains and consuming exotic meat.
 The conditions on seaparability of utility function between i) expensive
 non-durable consumption and ii) asset purchases is likely to be quite stringent.
 Further, the combining of diary data with recall data could make any conclusion
s of the combined model for the two substitutions too error-prone.
 (see the Deaton-Paxston paradox in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"

\end_inset

).
 Hence, we visit the two substitutions independently in the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Accumulation of Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accumulation of assets over a life-time can be modeled as an intertemporal
 life-cycle model.
 We formulate a discrete model first and walk through its details before
 adding continuity to the model parameters in order to to add differentiability
 to the marginal utility function and the constraints of a demand function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the discrete model, let's consider a consumer who gets a salary of 
\begin_inset Formula $I(t)$
\end_inset

 over the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 if the salary of our consumer 1000$ per month, then 
\begin_inset Formula $I(1)=12000$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I(0)=0$
\end_inset

).
 Assume that starting at her working age, she does not have any assets (an
 assume that is to be relaxed in any empirical study) and that she expects
 her salary to grow at a linear rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 per year (so that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.06$
\end_inset

 then in 40 years (
\begin_inset Formula $t=40$
\end_inset

 ) at her retirement, her income would be ~10,000 per month).
 We assume that she wants to give everything to charity at retirement and
 check herself into a health facility- which she would also have to pay
 for.
 Her wealth would be zero at retirement - i.e.
 no savings, no income nor even any assets - all of which would be sold
 off and paid out to a charity and the health facility (alternatively, she
 can pass it all on to her children).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that all individuals in the population are like our representative
 consumer - but with different starting salaries and habits even though
 they all have similar preferences (i.e.
 all else equal they all prefer health over a TV, a cell-phone over a radio
 etc.).
 We can assume that all assets are managed by a large firm (owing its success
 to preferences being the same for everybody) which provides furniture,
 housing and all amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Even the health facility - which our consumers plan to show up at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=R(=40)$
\end_inset

 along with other assets (and policies) are managed by this asset company
 - where all assets purchased have a finite lifetime 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The depreciation of the assets is not necessarily linear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a first cut analysis, let's also assume that there is no credit or borrowing
 in the market (an assumption that is not so far fetched in a developing
 economy).
 The no-credit assumption implies that the consumer can only save to buy
 more of the only asset available in the market.
 Therefore, after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

(=5) years of working starting in year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 let's say, the consumer's salary would be 
\begin_inset Formula $I(t)(1+\alpha)^{\tau-1}$
\end_inset

(=1400$/month), so that the total income she has earned is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=0}^{\tau-1}I(j+1)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(=\sum_{i=0}^{4}12000\times(1.06)^{i}=67645.12)$
\end_inset

.
 Out of this wealth, she could have purchased assets from a portion of her
 income (let's say
\begin_inset Formula $50000\$$
\end_inset

) and decide that she does not want more assets for the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, her life circumstances might have changed and she may need
 a bigger house or a more expensive house - and hence she would need an
 assets upgrade more urgently.
 We assume that such events can happen at any point in her life - although
 they have a higher probability around 
\begin_inset Formula $t=10$
\end_inset

.
 Being a rational consumer with full information, the consumer is aware
 of the probability of the such events occurring at every year.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}(t)$
\end_inset

 denote the number of year until which the consumer would need to save in
 order to purchase asset the desired 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 at price 
\begin_inset Formula $P(K)$
\end_inset

 so that if she sets her eyes on an asset 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 then she would purchase the asset at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\delta_{K}(t)$
\end_inset

 - as long as there are no changes in her circumstances.
 It may happend that at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=30$
\end_inset

 or some time before 
\begin_inset Formula $t=40$
\end_inset

 when she retires, the consumer sheds some of her assets - so as to prepare
 for retirement.
 It would thus mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}=0\forall K$
\end_inset

 after this event at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=30$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simplify the supply side and depreciation concerns, let's assume further
 that the health services - that are managed by the asset company - have
 an upfront cost (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{H}$
\end_inset

 =500,000 USD) and a finite lifetime 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{A}$
\end_inset

 as do all the other assets 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer wishes to both live longer and have higher assets throughout
 her life.
 She knows that if she doesn't pay the upfront cost at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=30$
\end_inset

, her probability of living longer would be lower.
 So she wishes to set aside a fixed portion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 of her income per year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 towards this investment.
 Since all assets are managed by the one asset company, every other asset
 and service is treated just the same by the consumer i.e.
 a constant saving rate is maintained until the accumulated savings match
 the desired asset cost level.
 It is important to remember that in this model, the probability of living
 longer and healthier is also an asset that would need to be purchased at
 a fixed price in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some others might want to start saving later than 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 or submit a higher proportion to their health as they grow older - but
 we can assume that they always all set aside a proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 of he salary - so that the minimum possible non-durable consumption is
 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 all income is saved (the maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 is the monthly income itself).
 We can thus state that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
0 & \le\gamma(t)\le I(t)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

 At any point 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the consumer's savings account can be represented by
\begin_inset Formula $c(t)$
\end_inset

 - which is intended to be spent towards an asset.
 If the assets owned by a consumer at year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 are represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(K)$
\end_inset

 denotes the price of the asset 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t)$
\end_inset

 is the sum of all savings minus the amount that was spent on assets i.e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
c(t) & =\sum_{\tau=0}^{t}\gamma(\tau)I(\tau)-\sum_{K\in\Lambda_{t}}P(K)=\psi(\Lambda_{t},P,\delta,\alpha,I)
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The business model of the asset company is based on selling packages with
 discrete cost value of assets - which are assumed to be in unlimited supply.
 The asset levels up for sale by the company can be sorted based on costs
 so that
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\mathscr{A}=}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\{A_{1},A_{2},...\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P(A_{1})<P(A_{2})<P(A_{3})<....$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 1K, 2K, 10K, 50K, 100K, 500K,....).
 The cost of the highest asset is limited only by the size of the economy,
 a consumer can buy the next asset unit as long as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
c(t+1) & \le\sum_{K\in\Lambda*_{t+1}\backslash\Lambda_{t}}P(K)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

Here, the desired future level of assets is represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{t+1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 We assume that the only way for our consumer to save for an asset is with
 a fixed proportion every month.
 For some asset level that are far beyond her reach, she would have to save
  for more than one year (there is always an asset in the market that she
 cannot buy).
 At equilibrium, the consumer would set the portion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 of annual income per year (notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t+1)=\gamma(t)+c(t)-\sum_{K\in\Lambda*_{t+1}\backslash\Lambda_{t}}P(K)$
\end_inset

) in a way that she can pay exactly for what she wants at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\tau_{K}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\tau_{K}\le R-t$
\end_inset

.
 The inequality therefore becomes an equality: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
c(t+\tau_{K}) & =\sum_{K\in\Lambda_{t+\tau_{K}}}P(K)\label{eq:savings_value}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 Therefore, at the end of the year, the consumers can spend all of 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t+1)=\sum_{K\in\Lambda_{t+1}}P(K)$
\end_inset

 or the consumer may roll over the account value 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t+1)$
\end_inset

 over to the next year when she faces the same choice.
 The proportion
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{*}(t+1)$
\end_inset

 is adjusted so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{*}(t+1)I(t+1)$
\end_inset

 goes towards the desired asset.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t+1)=c(t)$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t+1)=0$
\end_inset

 and it follows that no assets were planned for the future (since all future
 assets are planned with the proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

).
 This is because of our assumption that all planned assets are purchased
 through contributions 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 that add to 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t)$
\end_inset

.
 The rest of the salary i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $I(t)-\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 is always spent in the non-durable expenditure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rebalancing of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}(t)$
\end_inset

 every year is equivalent of stochastic component to the utility function
 whose expected value is maximised by the representative consumer.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}(t)$
\end_inset

 is simply the expected number of years that the consumer wants to save
 for until she achieves the next desired asset level.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 grows at the same rate as income 
\begin_inset Formula $I(t)$
\end_inset

 until 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}(t)$
\end_inset

 when it is used up from the accumulated 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t)$
\end_inset

 for the purchase of asset level 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 If the consumer intends to to purchase 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, then we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\sum_{j=t}^{t+\delta_{\kappa}}\gamma(j) & =c(t+\delta_{\kappa})-c(t)=P(\kappa)\label{eq:gamma_delta}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

If the consumer decides to reduce the savings 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}$
\end_inset

 gets increased accordingly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's illustrate the running of this discrete model with an example.
 If our consumer has 
\begin_inset Formula $50,000$
\end_inset

$ worth of assets and she wants an item of 
\begin_inset Formula $10,000\$$
\end_inset

 value, where here yearly salary is 
\begin_inset Formula $9,000$
\end_inset

 at year 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, then she must save 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[k,\delta+k-1]$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{\kappa}$
\end_inset

 years so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=k}^{k+\delta_{\kappa}-1}\gamma(k)=\gamma(k)\sum_{j=0}^{\delta_{\kappa}-1}(1+\alpha)^{j}=c(k+\delta_{\kappa})-c(k)=10000$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:gamma_delta"

\end_inset

).
 If
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{\kappa}(k)=3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.06$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{*}(k)\sim3140$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{*}(k)$
\end_inset

 is the planned 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{*}(k)$
\end_inset

 so the consumer must save 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(k)$
\end_inset

 this year to be able to be on track to afford the item in 3 years.
 If she could not save this much in the year i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(k)<\gamma^{*}(k)=3140$
\end_inset

 (more than 
\begin_inset Formula $I(k)-\gamma(k)$
\end_inset

 is spent in non-durable items), then the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{\kappa}(k+1)$
\end_inset

 for the next year would no longer be 2, but a new value that satisfies
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=0}^{\delta_{\kappa}(t+1)}(1+\alpha)^{k}\gamma^{*}(k+1)=10000-\gamma(t)$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}(t)$
\end_inset

 would thus depend on past fixings of
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{K}^{*}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming that the consumer still wants the asset at the same even after
 having missed the target for year 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 with
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(k)=2000$
\end_inset

, then as far as the accounting goes, she has 
\begin_inset Formula $50000\$$
\end_inset

 worth of assets, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(t)=$
\end_inset

2000$ saved for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(k+1)=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{*}(k+1)=3880$
\end_inset

.
 If she can postpone the asset purchase until another year then
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(t+1)=3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{*}(t+1)=2514$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that she does sell her owned assets to gain new because that would
 still keep her net worth the same - an opportunity that has already been
 considered by the asset company.
 If the consumer doesn't keep up with her plans, then it is even possible
 that she never acquires the asset she had set the target for

 Denoting

 as the quantity consumed of the non-durable items, we can simplify notation
 by writing

 For us to associate a continuous utility function depending on continuous
 quantities of consumption item and assets purchased, we would need to relax
 the constraint on
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$

 While we can derive econometric methods for the discrete as well as the
 continuous model, we need to use the solution of the continuous model in
 order to facilitate the discussion on the constraints for a demand function

The conditions of homogeneity, adding-up and non-negativeness of the Slutsky

 must also be continuous.
 This is the point at which we must introduce the ability for the consumer
 to borrow at a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 Having an asset level

 that is continuous would also require the perfect markets assumption so
 that the consumer can borrow some money and buy any desired asset 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 if she needs it and pay the loan back.
 Further, since higher priced assets provide a higher utility to our user,
 the price sensitivity of the utility ought to be a decreasing function
 of price (the same amount of money would not change the lifestyle by as
 much when one is rich compared to when one is poor).

The assumption is that in the equilibrium, the discounted value of expenditure
 should match the current values of assets.
 This because the consumer can either spend or save towards an asset.

 If we assume a loglinear utility function, we can estimate the the elasticities
 of goods (including assets using) as long as we have prices in every period.

\begin_inset Formula $c(t+1)=c(t)+\gamma(t)$

 We can therefore write,

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{K}(t)=1$
\end_inset

 if the desired asset is purchased, 0 otherwise.
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $c(t)$
\end_inset

 is not observed and is indicated only through an asset purchase.
 The only control we have is on the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}(t)$
\end_inset

 which depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 When an medium-priced assets are not available in a region, we expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{K}$
\end_inset

to be stay high over the life times - as consumers can only focus on longer-term
 goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since use the same that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t+1}=c_{t}+\gamma_{t+1}$

 is the next desired asset level, 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(P(K))$

 should be proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 Since, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 is influenced most by age - according to the life-cycle model, we expect
 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(P(K))$
\end_inset

 to be proportional to age.

 just use 
\begin_inset Formula $w\sim log(x)$

 to get any idea of the total expenditure? The approach equivalent to AIDS
 would be conducting an SUR with 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{c}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{A}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{A}$
\end_inset

 is calculated with the total assets purchased in the numerator and the
 denominator is calculated with the total non-durable expenditure.
 In the end, the econometric equation should be derived with the stochastic
 model for utility minimisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=\sum_{i}p_{it}q_{it}$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer's total wealth should stay the same or one could assume that
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 grows but moves slowly and must drop towards the end (if life-cycle hypothesis
 is true).
 We should therefore look at the evolution of log x and log P over t.
 The substitution would be with the SUR for budget share 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The budget shares depend on calculating 
\begin_inset Formula $x+P(K)$
\end_inset

 for the year.
 The SUR can be justified with the budget equation (based on total wealth
 calculated by discounting the assets over the life-time horizon).
 Calculating the discounting rate - however - is also fraught with problems

\begin_layout Subsection
Expensive non-durable consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Price differentiation in the market matters for the way a consumer sets
 herself apart from others through selection of higher-priced items.
 The more the price differentiation exists within a functional category,
 higher is the likelihood for the consumers to indicate status through purchase
 of higher priced item.
 If markets of items are perfect and differences in status as well as prices
 exist in an economy, then it is certain that those with higher purchasing
 power would attempt to maintain their status with the purchase of higher
 priced items.
 All expensive items cannot carry status (e.g.
 medical equipment) but all items that carry status must be priced higher.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We cannot base ourselves on the price-based model alone because of the lack
 of detailed price information in the LSMS survey - but we can use the observati
on whether expensive items were consumed by a consumer or not.
 Exotic meats or recreational electronic equipments are likely to be used
 by fewer and richer consumers in the survey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given our earlier discussion on scarcity, we must clarify that the scarcity
 of the item is not implied by how sparsely it is used by the consumers.
 For example, medical equipment or musical instruments would always be limited
 to a certain section of the population - but they become a status product
 
\shape italic
only
\shape default
 if there are low-price substitutes that exist for them.
 Therefore, an item's low distribution may count towards status only as
 long as it can be viewed as superior to other substitutes (through price
 if the markets exist for the category).
 Notice also that participation of consumers in the same market is key in
 the view of the status advantage through price differences.
 Certain items may have higher price varieties due to transport costs -
 so if the markets where consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 participate are affected by different supply-side issues then it would
 be erroneous to consider status differences on grounds of price differences
 observed by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 It makes sense in fact to think of the gain (loss) of status by being in
 a region where more items are available (unavailable).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, note that the asset based model is not concerned with the differences
 in visibility of items within a functional category, the measurement of
 visibility index (as employed by Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

 and Khamis et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia"

\end_inset

) is not relevant to the model.
 In other words, we are not concerned with whether items within a functional
 group (e.g.
 food, personal products or housing) are more or less visible with respect
 to each other - hence the difference between values of a visibility index
 for shampoo and that for body-oil is rather irrelevant for the model.
 The idea of visibility is incorporated only in the preference for visibility
 that exists for functional categories (food,energy, housing etc.).
 While clothes could be deemed more visible than an investment policy -
 a more specific order of visibility within a category (e.g.
 shampoo vs body-oil) is unimportant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To outline the utility model for the expensive non-durable consumption,
 let's assume that a category 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 (such that all 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in\mathscr{C}$
\end_inset

 are separable in utility) has either certain high-price items with itself
 or the status reflection on the consumer by consumption in the category
 is greatly influenced by an asset in the same category.
 We assume for now that both properties do not hold within a category 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Consider thus a two-category world of food and housing so that food category
 has many high-price choices (the selection of high-priced items being quantifie
d by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{food}$
\end_inset

) while housing is greatly influenced by ownership (which is quantified
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{housing}$
\end_inset

).
 We can then assume that a consumer optimises her status according to the
 following separable utility function: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
u=u(x_{food,}x_{housing},\sigma_{food},\sigma_{housing}) & =U(u_{food}(q_{food},\sigma_{food}),\\
 & u_{housing}(q_{housing},\sigma_{housing}))
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since consumer may already have a tendency to use derive more status from
 housing than from food, we can permit another parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{c\in\mathscr{C}}$
\end_inset

 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(x_{food},x_{housing},\sigma_{food},\sigma_{housing})\\
 & =U(\lambda_{food}u_{food}(q_{food},\sigma_{food}),\lambda_{housing}u_{housing}(q_{housing},\sigma_{housing}))
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, if we treat the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{c\in\mathscr{C}}$
\end_inset

 as commodities, then we can associate the utility derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in\mathscr{C}$
\end_inset

 as if it were a commodity whose quantity consumed was 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{c\in\mathscr{C}}$
\end_inset

 .
 Thus replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{c}\rightarrow q_{s\_c}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{c}\rightarrow\lambda_{s\_c}$
\end_inset

 the utility can be written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
u=u(x_{food},x_{housing},\sigma_{food},\sigma_{housing})=V(\lambda_{food}u_{food}(q_{food}),\lambda_{food}u_{s\_food}(q_{s\_food}),\\
\lambda_{housing}u_{housing}(q_{housing}),\lambda_{housing}u_{s\_housing}(q_{s\_housing}))\label{eq:status_as_commodity}
\end{multline}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the loglinear utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum a_{i}log(q_{i})$
\end_inset

 where quality is modeled as another item whose quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be included in the utility, we can calibrate the model with data.
 Notice however that additivity restricts substitutability between categories
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

) and hence we may not draw any conclusions on substitution between categories.
 Even otherwise (i.e.
 if additivity was not used), any conclusions related to substitution between
 categories would be subject to a significant measurement error because
 of the data on food being available weekly while the rest being available
 over a month/year.
 Also, as detailed in the works of Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation"

\end_inset

 and Nelson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the utility cannot be written in terms of the aggregate commodity for
 a category without assumptions on stability of the price-structure.

We find that the income spectrum is heavily skewed in the developing world.
 In Tanzania, only around 30% of heads of the recorded households have any
 reported income.
 Having two jobs and owning multiple self-owned (small) businesses is not
 uncommon and the mode of payment is often not in cash.
 The amount of income recorded for the household is thus frequently based
 on the person's estimate of the item provided as income.
 All of these can make the incomes estimates noisy at best.
 The income levels themselves seem poorly correlated with expenditure levels.
 One possible way to measure this noise is by observing the variance of
 income in the same region

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue of availability is particularly relevant in the developing countries
 since the rural areas are faced with unavailability of services and goods
 that are available (although limited) in the urban areas.
 Indeed, such unavailability can spiral into severe demand pressures through
 pressures on urban migration.
 In the data from Tanzania, for example, we find not only that the region
 dummies are significant in consumption of certain items in the survey (particul
arly with respect to such as electricity which is completely unavailable
 in large parts of the country).
 The availability of electricity seems to transform the income elasticities
 of demand for other expenditures as well (e.g.
 marriage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issues of supply (availability) are prevalent in assets as well.
 As the consumption of a lot of items are dependent on each other - thus
 they are forgone collectively.
 In other words, the status disadvantage from not consuming an item 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may add up towards the disadvantage from not consuming 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 if the consumption on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is dependent on consuming the item 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the status disadvantage from not consuming electricity may
 include the disadvantage of not having AC, stereo speakers etc.
 In reality, when the consumers in an area don't have access to electricity,
 they lose collectively in the status hierarchy simply by being residents
 of the region.
 In such a case, it's there is simply no opportunity to overspend on electricity
 to emulate those who have electricity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An analysis of the time-series data across multiple geographies (e.g.
 a quantile regression on a time-series of purchases across several income
 quantiles of the population) can further test whether consumers with different
 income ranks within a society do engage in pecuniary emulation or not.

We extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(q)\sim ln(x)+d+region$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{skincreamconsu}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and the lack of different means in the region, we can be assured that
 stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.
