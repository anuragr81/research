Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models for demand analysis rely on exogenous price observations for the
 consumer's basket.
 The prices observed in the market embody both i) how the market, subject
 to supply pressures, evaluates the needs of the consumers and ii) how it
 prices the differences in quality variants of the same commodity to the
 consumer.
 Despite market-observed prices being of a central importance to the demand
 analysis, it is only recently that the detailed prices observed in the
 market are made available in micro-data surveys.
 Arguing that market prices are key to an understanding of quality, we enhance
 a typical demand analysis to include the quality variation within commodities,
 the needs faced by the consumer and other household characteristics such
 as income and social hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the analysis that follows, the needs of the consumers are proxied by
 the number of members (age-adjusted) in the household (and other available
 scales) while quality is measured as the portion of budget spent on high
 vs low-price items.
 With the AIDS formulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonMuellbauerAIDS"

\end_inset

 for this simple model for quality, the scale of consumer needs appears
 as a control variable in the AIDS budget share equations whereas the quality-ch
oices appear as dependent variables in the equations (along with the budget
 shares for every commodity).
 This is the "Unrestricted Method" used by McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

 and Gibson et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As argued before, the status that a consumer derives from consumption must
 come out of either elite non-durable consumption or high-priced durable
 consumption.
 Thus, tracking the two over time (i.e.
 high-quality consumption and the assets owned by the consumers observed
 over time) can help us explain status consumption with the help of a model
 for intertemporal choice under uncertainty over time.
 We therefore intend to measure i) the extent to which the consumers change
 their long-term purchase habits (i.e.
 by making some discrete choices) and ii) the extent to which they choose
 to save for future stocks rather than to overspend on higher quality in
 the current time period.
 While the unrestricted method we choose allows us to explain differences
 in quality in consumer choice, it parametrises neither the discrete choices
 that a consumer faces on less available items (such as electricity in Tanzania)
 nor the substitution between assets purchased and quality demanded .
 In the current chapter, we have attempted to address the former by enhancing
 the AIDS formulation with a selection approach.
 A model for the latter - which requires a dynamic model for asset ownership
 and habit changes/inertia is explored in a later chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we present a selection equation approach for the conventional AIDS formulatio
n in the current chapter, we discuss the distribution of quality for food
 and non-food items before motivating a discrete choice model for uncertainty
 to model the gaps in quality and asset ownership that may arise out of
 long-standing inequalities in income, social inequalities or regional deprivati
on.

Literature Survey
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the past decades, Deaton's AIDS methodology has been employed widely
 for its robustness and simplicity.
 Based on PIGL approaches originally popularised by Barten
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BartenPreferences"

\end_inset

, Gorman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GormanPreference"

\end_inset

 and Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerAggConsum"

\end_inset

), the method is simple to implement and yet readily conforms to the demand
 function restrictions.
 Still, AIDS implementations - like any other - are often ailed by the lack
 of observed market prices.
 The approach that is used quite often is to stick the implicit price-deflator
 (or unit-values) as prices in the AIDS regressions (see Tafere et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"

\end_inset

 for a recent example).
 While this may be the best way to proceed when market price are not observed,
 their use can result in a severe measurement error since the quantities
 consumed by the consumer appear both in the dependent variable (as budget
 share's numerator) of the AIDS equations (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

) and in the control variables (as the denominator for unit-value used as
 price).
 Since observing market prices prevents such measurements errors (see the
 discussion by McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

 and Gibson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GibsonKimQualityBog2019"

\end_inset

), we prefer their use for understanding the consumption of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of market prices in consumer surveys hardly makes the AIDS methodology
 less usable - only that the correction of such measurement errors is not
 always trivial (see Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonSurveyElasticities"

\end_inset

 for one such approach and McKelvey's assessment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

 of the Deaton method).
 AIDS method can in fact be easily extended to other panel data scenarios.
 For example, the demographic variables in the AIDS model can be accommodated
 with the so-called demographic translation where the intercept 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\alpha_{i}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_{ij}ln(p_{jh})+\beta_{i}ln(\frac{x_{h}}{P})$
\end_inset

 is expanded as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\alpha_{i} & =\rho_{io}+\sum_{k=1}^{s}\rho_{ik}d_{k}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,n]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{k}$
\end_inset

 are the demographic variables (see Pollack and Wales 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PollockWalesDemand"

\end_inset

).
 Similarly, the structural changes in the parameters over time is addressed
 with a dynamic AIDS formulation that is often based on differencing the
 budget shares over the time-periods (see Anderson and Blundell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersonBlundellAIDSTest1983,AndersonBlundellDynEqn1982"

 for a first-order dynamic model).

 adjust AIDS to account for cases when there is no consumption on certain
 items - by incorporating an inverse Mills ratio into the AIDS regressions.
 This approach is particularly relevant for the analysis of quality since
 the consumption on high quality goods is often 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truncated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a significant part of the population.
 This approach performs a first-stage probit where the dependent variable
 is an indicator variable - denoting whether the household 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 consumes the item 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (given 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

ln(P) & =\alpha_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}ln(p_{i})+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\gamma_{ij}ln(p_{i})ln(p_{j})
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, a simpler linear-AIDS formulation is often used so that 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}ln(p_{ih})$
\end_inset

 (the Stone's index).
 Notice that the inverse-mills instrument must also comply with the symmetry
 and homogeneity-restrictions and thus one must ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=0}^{n}\delta_{i}R_{ih}=0$
\end_inset

 in addition to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\alpha_{i}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\gamma_{ij}=0\forall j\in[1,n]$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}\beta_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{ij}=\gamma_{ji}$
\end_inset

.
 Heien-Wessells implementation choose a more general approach for the instrument
 variable by adding an equation to the system with term 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{i}R_{ih}$
\end_inset

 replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\delta_{i}R_{ih}$
\end_inset

so that the additivity condition is always met.
 Unfortunately, they are compelled to use the unit-values instead of (unavailabl
e) market prices - an issue probably made worse by having to stick in the
 unit-values (obtained from the consumers' using an item) as prices on to
 those who don't consume the item.
 This is needed because the price isn't available when the indicator variable
 is zero i.e.
 when the consumers don't consumer an item

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, Heien-Wessells use a regression with unit-values obtained from
 users who do consume the item as the dependent variable and with control
 variables as their region, income etc.
 .
 The values thus obtained are used as price for the consumers who don't
 consume the item.

Deaton method
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 gets around the price-deflator (unit-value) issues by using the cluster-average
s fitted budget shares and unit-values (which are used instead of the unobserved
 prices).
 Even though Deaton uses these methods for a cross-sectional analysis, the
 intuition can be easily extended to panel data (see McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for this extension).
 We reckon that the so-called RDMP (

) - used for studying quality variation in commodities when market prices
 are not available - would also suffer with the issue of measurement error
 that is introduced with the use of unit values (see Gibson and Kim

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted before, out of the food, energy, transport and household commodity
 groups, we only consider quality differences in food and energy subgroups
 - whereas the other commodity groups are viewed as groups where asset possessio
n (or ownership of long-term durable goods) matters more than quality variation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prices observed in the market are central to our measure of quality
 and to the later discussion of cross-price effects.
 As we don't use price-deflators in our analysis (due the measurement errors
 that arise with quantity being in both in the denominator of the control
 variables and in the numerator of the dependent variable), a matching of
 prices of the items observed in the market (identified by region and district)
 to those of the items purchased by the consumer (with known region and
 district) is of key importance to our analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LSMS Tanzania surveys record the prices observed in the markets spread across
 all regions in the country.
 These prices are available for items in the food and energy commodity groups.
 The items within these commodities are grouped according to the relative
 structure of the price time-series observed from 2008 to 2014 shown in

Here is a list of issues that were observed in the available price data
 as well as the solutions adopted to address the issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A lot of items in the year 2008 were recorded with the unit as pieces/"idadi"
 (e.g.
 5 pieces of chicken or 4 pieces of banana etc.).
 For year 2008, there are 588 observations that record prices in terms of
 pieces.
 Since it is difficult to associate a physical measure to a piece, the year
 2008 was removed from our analysis
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These items were : maize_green, bread, bunscakes, pasta, cassava_fresh,
 cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam, potatoes, banana_green, othervegstarch,

 citrus, mangoes, sugarcane, goat, beef, chicken, eggs, fish_seafood, dried_cann
ed_fish, fresh_milk, canned_milk, firewood, cooking_oil, salt, brews, kerosene
 and charcoal.
 The use of pieces, however, has been discouraged since 2008.
 For 2010, we only see the prices on bread, banana_ripe, goat, beef, chicken,
 eggs and fresh_milk items where they are recorded in pieces.
 These price recording are ignored for our analysis.
 In 2012, the items where pieces are used are limited to - bunscakes, goat,
 chicken, eggs and fish_seafood.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 With the asset ownership details not being available for 2008, the year
 being too far back to use the 2010 household and transport CPI baskets
 and it being difficult to find prices of electricity for the year, the
 year 2008 offers very little to be included in our analysis.
 That said, we do use the 2008 prices for when the units recorded are not
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in order to determine the price-structure that aids the classification
 of food groups (with similar price-structure).

 for the prices observed from 2008 to 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A few outlier price observations (<5%) are rejected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
While a household in the LSMS consumption data is identified down to the
 village and enumeration area level - we do not expect the surveys to record
 market-prices at every possible enumeration area and village.
 We thus associate a district level price to a household's consumed item.
 In other words, the price of an item consumed by a household is linked
 to all households in the same district where the household is located.
 We make no attempts to arrive at a price granularity lower than that of
 a district.
 When there are multiple price observations at the district level, we arrive
 a district-level price using a regression (discussed below).
 Further, when the prices are not available at the district levels, we use
 the regional averages (i.e.
 the next level of granularity available).
 For items such as electricity and gas that are limited to a few urban areas,
 we simply use the price at a national level

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now describe the regression of marked-price against quantity that we
 use to assimilate the price data from the survey.
 To explain this regression, let's consider an example of the marked prices
 of rice (let's say) for 1 kg, 2kg, 5kg and 10kg in the market.
 A typical set of marked prices could be 4£, 7.5£, 18£ and 35£ respectively
 - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

 for the plot of these example prices.
 As if often the case, such unit-prices grow at a less than linear rate
 as is shown in the plot of the unit-price corresponding to the quantities
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:unitprice"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore a linear regression of 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $mp$
\end_inset

 is the marked price of the item and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 the quantity consumed) is hardly appropriate.
 The goal of the regression is to arrive at the price of unit-quantity (e.g.
 the price per kg for rice in the current example) rather than matching
 the appropriate marked price with the quantity purchased by the consumer
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If we were to really look for a perfect match for prices, then we should
 not only match the quantities consumed by the consumer with the prices
 recorded in the market but also the time of the household interview with
 that of the price recorded.
 Not only is this fine matching somewhat impractical ( survey prices are
 hardly available at such fine levels of granularity ), it is largely unnecessar
y since our view of price is that of a value that is faced by a sufficiently
 large number of consumers in the survey.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The regression we use therefore is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta\frac{1}{q^{2}}+c$
\end_inset

 (assuming that the marked price is lower than a linear increase - see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:markedprices"

\end_inset

 - by a factor that itself decreases with increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $mp=aq-b/q$
\end_inset

).
 Since we use the price set 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset

, the price to be used is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta+c$
\end_inset

 for the regression: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{mp}{q}=\beta/q^{2}+c$
\end_inset

.
 The regression is run only when more than two prices are available.
 When the regression can't be used a simple median is used as the price
 for such cases
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This does not happen as frequently as one may imagine.
 For 2010, only 9 identified regions for just 6 items have less than three
 marked-prices available.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The price-inference is therefore a 2-stage process - we first obtain prices
 for every district with the regression method.
 If there are no marked prices available in a district, we use the regional
 value of the price.
 For some items, the region-prices are not available for some regions.
 Here, the price from obtained by the regressions over the country is used
 for the item.
 The prices for some items whose consumption is relatively rare in the diary
 data (e.g.
 wild-birds and honey) are not available for any of the regions.
 These items are ignored for the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the prices we obtain after the regression, we match the price for every
 commodity consumed by the household based on the district it is located
 in.
 The next step is to define the groups based on price-structure.
 We use a broad classification of items for separability assumption to hold.
 Within foods we observe protein, fruits, dense-foods, complements and non-fresh
 groups and within energy, we put kerosene and electricity under the same
 group (energy).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can argue that a selection bias is introduced when we use the national-avera
ges for some items and region averages for other.
 This could be a problem if the unavailability of regional averages occurred
 for a significant portion of price entries.
 However, since only about 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim4\%$
\end_inset

 of the total price observations have no regional averages, the bias thus
 introduced would be rather insignificant.
 Another issue could be taken with our grouping of commodities - as it relies
 on the annual time-series data.
 It is indeed possible that the price of some items may be more volatile
 than the others - and thus the volatility being ignored in the annual time
 series data would bring some bias.
 However, since we combine the household log diary with the recall diary
 (which is recorded on a monthly or yearly basis), a finer time-series for
 prices is not enough to address this issue.
 Such a bias can be alleviated only through finer price data

finer as well as uniformly collected household consumption data.

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A price-based view of quality has been adopted for our current analysis.
 Thus a consumer who buys more of the high-priced item is seen as consuming
 higher quality.
 This view allows us to see how the demand for quality is distributed across
 the population and varies in response to prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A framework often used for analysis of quality treats quality as a regular
 item in the market.
 As for any other item, therefore, the demand for quality must conform to
 the usual demand restrictions i.e.
 the conditions of homogeneity, adding up and non-negativity of the Slutsky
 matrix.
 Since we treat quality as if it were any other item, it is natural to ask
 if a consumer observes a price for quality and if so, should this price
 of quality appear in the econometric analysis.
 As we later explain, the price of quality can be represented as the price
 of a commodity aggregate along with the relative-price structure within
 the aggregate.
 The two implicitly determine what one may consider the price of quality.

Before we describe how quality is measured for our purposes in the current
 chapter, we survey a few approaches towards quality measurement that have
 been used in the literature.
 To avoid confusion of terms in our discussion on quality, we use the nomenclatu
re provided by Cramer

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest of these approaches is to view the demand for a high-quality
 item as more of the low-cost item.
 This approach strives to obtain an adjustment factor for the demand based
 on the consumption on items (see Griliches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GrilichesIndex1971"

\end_inset

 for the theoretical underpinnings with the approach and with measurement
 of quality change).
 A formulation more relevant to our approach is provided by Houthakker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerFamilySurvey"

\end_inset

 and Deaton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

 where quality is viewed as a separate commodity.
 Here, the quantities consumed for two (or more) items within a commodity
 (e.g.
 tea and carbonated drinks under beverages) can be viewed as a quantity
 of a composite good (i.e.
 beverages) along with the value consumed of a quality metric (proportion
 of tea and carbonated drinks).
 In other words, the quantity-price tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1},p_{1}),(q_{2},p_{2})...$
\end_inset

 within a commodity could be expressed as a quantity and quality pair i.e.
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1},p_{1}),(q_{2},p_{2})...$
\end_inset

, we should have 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q_{G},P_{G}),(\nu_{G},p_{\nu_{G}})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G},Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 are prices and quantity consumed for a composite good while 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{G}$
\end_inset

 represents the quality of the good corresponding to the real quantities
 consumed for several items.
 If the quantities consumed are observed then this is simply a price-structure
 (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{*})$
\end_inset

 weighted sum of quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\nu_{G} & =\sum_{i\in G}(\frac{q_{i}p_{i}^{*}}{q_{G}})\label{eq:quality_def}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

 represents the price-structure ratio corresponding to the item 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{G}=\sum_{j\in G}q_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{G}$
\end_inset

 is thus simply the physical sum of quantities consumed.
 Note that regardless of how the items are aggregated, such a formulation
 always requires the aggregation conditions of the composite commodity theorem
 conditions to be met (see Nelson

 for details).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we wish to understand consumer behaviour under the price differentiation
 within a commodity, it may seem apt to talk about the price of quality
 in the market.
 We argue that the relative price structure of items along with a composite
 price for the aggregate provides a measure equivalent to price of the quality.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 represents the expenditure on group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, using a constant relative price-structure allows us to write the demand
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(E_{G},p_{G})$
\end_inset

 as :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
g(E_{G},p_{G}) & \equiv g(\frac{E_{G}}{P_{G}},p_{G}^{*})\label{eq:demand_function_quality}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So while we do treat quality as a separate commodity, the constant-relative
 price structure precludes the need of a price of quality in the cost-function
 (and thus in the budget share regression) 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One way to establish this equivalence is to interpret the quality in the
 market as the gradient of price of preferred items (sorted by price or
 otherwise) - an approach that is more akin to the aggregation problem.
 Consider for example that with energy, such a gradient would be calculated
 with the price one has to pay to get more of electricity.
 Similarly, for food, this would be the price one has to pay to get more
 of meat etc.
 The formulation effectively relies on the basket aggregate consumed - and
 is thus equivalent to the composite aggregated method (which in turn relies
 on a composite aggregate price).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider an example to illustrate how this measure of quality relates
 with total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 in the group, the group aggregate price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 (see Nelson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 for a more detailed theoretical discussion).
 Let's say we observe the consumption on lamb and chicken within a protein
 commodity with prices observed as 20£, 10£ (resp.) and the quantities consumed
 by the consumer are 1.5 kg and 2 kg (resp.).
 One approach is to the treat the physical sum of quantities i.e.
 3.5 kg as the quantity of the composite good 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

protein
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, it is difficult to argue that the consumers optimise the weight
 of the composite good - rather than comparing the disparate quantities
 of items (see Nelson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 for the technical details of this argument)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If the sum of physical quantities is denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{G}=\sum_{i\in G}q_{i}$
\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}=\frac{E_{G}}{P_{G}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}$
\end_inset

 is the expenditure and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 is the price-index.
 The core of Nelson's argument is that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}=q_{G}$
\end_inset

 only if quality effects are absent since 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}=q_{G}\Rightarrow\frac{E_{G}}{P_{G}}=\frac{E_{G}}{V_{G}}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow P_{G}=V_{G}=P_{G}\nu_{G}$
\end_inset

 (unit quantity is interpreted as 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}=\frac{E_{G}}{q_{G}}$
\end_inset

 ).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A quality-adjusted quantity is a more appropriate formulation for this
 purpose.
 Since quality is to be priced in the market, we can consider this price-structu
red weighted quantity as the quality-adjusted quantity and express the pair
\begin_inset Formula $\{(20,1.5).(10,2)\}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,4(=2\times1.5+1\times2))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.6=\frac{4}{1.5+2})$
\end_inset

 .
  Notice that the price of composite quality is exactly zero since the total
 expenditure is already accounted for in the composite good i.e.
 10
\begin_inset Formula $\times4=40$
\end_inset

.
 If the quantities consumed were slightly different for another consumer
 e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{(20,0.5),(10,3)\}$
\end_inset

 then too 
\begin_inset Formula $(E=40)$
\end_inset

 and we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,4(=2\times0.5+1\times3))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1.14=\frac{4}{3.5})$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to see that the quality is lower for the latter case even though
 the physical quantity is the same.
 The quality adjusted quantity accounts for the total expenditure and as
 such there is no price needed for the quality value calculated in the above
 fashion.
 Even though quality is treated as a separate good, the use of a quality-adjuste
d quantity instead of the physical quantity gives us a clearer view of the
 composite price of the commodity
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This measure of quality is slightly different from Deaton's approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 which uses the sum of physical quantities.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the quality metric used above rests upon the
 rather stringent condition of a constant relative price structure (i.e.
 the Hicks aggregation commodity theorem).
 Further, we can aggregate quality in the commodity only as long as the
 goods within the commodity group can be ordered based on a certain criteria
 - an order that is the judgment of the researcher - not the consumer (see
 Nelson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 for this clarification).
 For the meat commodity group, as an example, there may be no reason to
 think that goat is of higher quality than beef if the former is slightly
 costlier.
 However, quality differences are more plausible if the price differences
 are larger - e.g.
 with the choice of pulses over chicken under the protein category.
 The judgment of quality is thus provided by the researcher at an appropriate
 level of granularity - a justification that is a prerequisite for any quantity
 aggregation to make sense.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the obvious limitations to the universality of such an aggregation
 criterion, the utility of the above metric in understanding consumption
 of quality is restricted by the very aggregated view that makes it desirable
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice also that one cannot talk about the quality metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{G}$
\end_inset

 defined above unless the quantity of consumption is observed in data.
 This is often the case for food, but not necessarily for other goods such
 as energy.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The approaches that view a higher quality product in terms of a lower quality
 product are problematic when the items vary widely.
 As an example, the demand of a better good in a commodity group as a multiple
 of the worse good may be plausible for meat/food whereas considering electricit
y in terms of the coal used into one aggregate is far less plausible (see
 the discussion on consumer indices in Fisher-Shell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 on how this issue could be remedied).
 At the consumer's level, the substitution between kerosene and electricity
 is not as straightforward as amongst qualities of protein.
 A continuous measure of quality does make more sense in a setting where
 a mixture of high and low quality items are consumed (see Houthakker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HouthakkerFamilySurvey"

\end_inset

 for an example) - but it fails to account for quality difference when choices
 vary widely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In non-food categories (e.g.
 transport - which is the subject of a seminal work on discrete choice by
 Domencic-McFadden
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McFaddenDomencic1975"

\end_inset

), a discrete view of quality differences makes more sense - where the consumers
 either consume a certain quantity of an item or they don't at all (more
 so in the developing countries where income inequalities are starker).
 In the current chapter, we provide a selection approach to interpret demand
 for such items.
 Even though it is often possible to proxy quality differences as regional
 differences, modeling of discrete choice may prove to be a better approach
 to explaining the choices that consumers face for non-food commodities.
 This is to be explored in later chapters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As our wider goal has been to explain status consumption using the intertemporal
 substitution and the consumer's perception of risk, we intend to use the
 asset ownership of consumers, their needs and the consumption of quality
 in the intertemporal setting to explain how they may substitute between
 quality over commodity groups and the assets owned (see condition C1).
 Thus, a rise in prices of electricity could affect food quality - even
 though the quantity consumed is limited by needs.
 An analysis of the cross-price effects i.e.
 the effect of prices of non-food items on food quality and vice versa can
 help us understand this substitution.
 The data on possession of assets can also indicate the differences in the
 quality tastes in the different asset ownership bands.
 A comparison of changes in asset ownership over time and across several
 household-characteristics can comment on whether the consumers sustain
 the quality consumption patterns relative to stock purchases (LTDG) or
 not.
 This is the topic to discussed in the subsequent chapters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now provide a comparison of two variants of the AIDS model used for measuring
 quality elasticities in the literature.
 We assess their relevance, shortcomings before suggesting an adaption to
 our goals.
 In the first variant, an detailed item-wise analysis of cross-price elasticitie
s is provided (Heien-Wessells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeienWessellsAIDSCensored1990"

\end_inset

).
 The second AIDS variant (McKelvey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McKelveyQuality2011"

\end_inset

) uses the measure of quality (as defined above) - except for electricity
 (which is simply an indicator variable).
 Asset ownership also appear as indicator variables in the latter variant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue in favour of a discrete method - which we believe would make more
 sense in the status consumption contexts where the ownership of long-term
 durable goods needs to be considered.
 A cross-section analysis of quality and assets purchased is thus provided
 to motivate the need for a discrete modeling of choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

A selection equation approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first AIDS variant uses non-consumption corrected estimates of demand
 elasticities to explain the effect of prices and household income on the
 demand for every item.
 The first part of this method is a selection step - needed to account for
 the non-consumption of a certain items.
 In the second part, a pooled static-AIDS method as described above (see
 Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_probit"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

) is used on the consumption microdata from 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-part i.e.
 selection is a probit that provides refinement to the second-part item-wise
 AIDS (which would have been appropriate in a more homogeneous dataset with
 less instances of non-consumption for items).
 The dependent variable in the probit is an indicator variable which is
 unity when the item is consumed and zero otherwise.
 The inverse-imlls ratio calculated from the probit (as explained with the
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invmills"

\end_inset

 - see Heien-Wessells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeienWessellsAIDSCensored1990"

\end_inset

) is in turn used as an instrument in the AIDS SUR regressions of the second
 part (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:wessells_aids"

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the instrument is calculated for every household and every
 item - and is part of the additivity constraint that is used for estimation
 (see Appendix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraints of symmetry, additivity and homogeneity are essential in
 facilitating a discussion of the effect of cross-elasticities on demand
 (measured as budget shares).
 The results thus obtained with a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) after
 imposing the constraints are presented in the Appendix.
 The own-price and cross-price elasticities in the results provide us an
 overview of the demand across rare and commonly consumed items.
 Our interpretation is based solely on the statistical significance (value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

) and the economic significance (i.e.
 the size of the coefficient).
 Observing the signs of the coefficients, we see that mangoes (less consumed)
 and rice (commonly consumed) are substitutes while fish is a complement
 to cassava-flour ([qfish_seafood]lpcassava_flour <0 etc.) rice.
 Further, fresh milk is a complement to beef, beer, cassava_flour ([qcassava_flo
ur]lpfresh_milk = -0.001) and greens but a substitute to bread and mangoes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The item-wise analysis suggests a split between the items that are consumed
 in rural households (where the greens and fruits seem more abundant) against
 those consumed in urban households (where beef, charcoal and beer are more
 readily available).
 The elasticities against income and education also show that the items
 available in the industrialised regions of the Tanzania seem to have positive
 elasticities for income and education rank whereas the items of agrarian
 production seem to matter less to the highly educated, middle-age populations
 huddled in the urban areas.
 While many of such insights could be offered with a simpler cross-sectional
 analysis using a regression of expenditure on the item against the permanent-in
come or total expenditure by the household etc.
 (an approach that is followed in much of the literature on conspicuous
 consumption
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,KausSA,CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

), the censored AIDS formulation was favoured due to reasons - first it
 allows us to understand the cross-price effects in a more robust framework
 and second, it accounts for the non-consumption of items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further with the cross-elasticities analyses, a comparison of how
 consumers respond to changes in kerosene and electricity prices further
 confirms the concentrated availability of industrial items.
 A contrast between the items that are influenced by electricity prices
 and those that are influenced by kerosene prices demonstrates this split
 - since the demand for items such as rice, beef is less sensitive to electricit
y than it is to kerosene.
 That is to say, it isn't simply that the electricity consumers are more
 likely to consume the more expensive items (due to their higher incomes)
 but that a certain items become less relevant in the urban settings or
 are simply unavailable in the rural settings.
 This segregation of contexts cannot be ignored in a discussion of status-relate
d consumption in the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the detailed analyses that the cross-elasticities can provide, there
 are indeed limitations to an item-wise approach.
 First, the detailed cross-elasticities are more likely to fluctuate over
 time and would require us to use a dynamic approach to ascertain model
 stability (an inertia or myopia in choices can be maintained to address
 this).
 Second, and more importantly, the cross-price elasticities fail to model
 the functional separation in consumption e.g.
 the lack of substitutability between energy and food items.
 For example, the cross-elasticities of kerosene with buns or cassava cannot
 be interpreted unless one imposes other assumptions on the closely observed
 consumption patterns (e.g.
 more buns would means less cooking in the household etc.) or even stricter
 separability assumptions.
 Since we are concerned with the choice of quality exercised by the consumer
 when faced with multiple varieties of several qualities and price, an aggregate
d view of the basket seems more appropriate.
 Such an aggregation is based on a measurable criteria - which for the current
 approach is the price of the items.
 The availability of price information between the years 2008 and 2014 prevents
 the problems that could be faced by other grouping criteria - such as visibilit
y (used in much of the literature on conspicuous consumption) - the changes
 to which are not observed over a sufficiently long period of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregated view does add the functional view to the consumer choice
 that is not available in an item-wise approach.
 Observing consumption at a higher level e.g.
 with separability assumptions facilitates the interpretation of cross-price
 effects.
 Whenever aggregation is possible (subject to restrictions), it can provide
 a way to interpret the consumer choice for quality - while representing
 the substitution between broader categories and the price variants within
 the commodities in the econometric model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the aggregation provides an intermediate step to merging the data
 from recall and diary methods.
 As items are often recorded with more details for the diary items than
 for the recall items (the types of phones, clothes purchased by the consumers
 are hardly recorded in the surveys for example), the merging or data from
 recall and diary methods is rendered inappropriate.
 An aggregation can represent the diary data at a coarser granularity -
 which can be matched with that of the recall method.

 (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Analysis"

\end_inset

).
 These AIDS equations used are fewer than in the item-wise censored model
 of the first AIDS variant.
 Every commodity aggregate - which consists of several items - corresponds
 to one aggregate quantity/budget equation and a quality metric corresponding
 to the commodity aggregate.
 The aggregation also circumvents the issue of non-consumption since it
 is much less likely for no items to be consumed within a functional commodity
 group (fruits-veg, starch, protein etc.) .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that while such an AIDS formulation does not model the intertemporal
 substitution, the condition C1 allows us to compare the quality variation
 in certain commodity groups with the durable good possession in others
 (Recall also that we rule out the use of a two-state budgeting model since
 a substitution exists between commodity groups due to this very condition).
 The commodity groups used for the our analyses are food, energy, household
 and transportation.
 We use the CPI for housing and transportation since the expenditure on
 them is considered elementary consumption - categories where assets/LTDG
 are deemed more important.
 In other words, no quality differences are observed in consumption on household
 items (toilet rolls, clothing etc.) or transportation.
 The expenditure on housing and transportation are treated as if they were
 (each) just one commodity whereas different variants of proteins and starches
 (i.e.
 goods) are considered.

The aggregation allows us to be more ambitious - as we include the recall

 As we ignore quality differences in the expenditure on transport as well
 as for household categories, the AIDS SUR uses household-CPI and transport-CPI
 as prices for these respective groups and no 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ V$

 Variables for transport and a household asset scores are in included as
 household characteristics (asset scores are simply a normalised rank assigned
 to the household based on the total assets it possesses).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To observe the usage of electricity in the population, we can either use
 an electricity-usage dummy variable or use a probit stage as we did in
 the first variant.
 The choice is really whether we're interested in the effect of distribution
 of electricity on overall quality of commodities or the consumer preference
 for electricity.
 If we were to understand the preference for electricity, a probit stage
 would have been more appropriate.
 However, we have observed from the item-wise AIDS that the consumers prefer
 electricity as their incomes rise.
 Our goal is now to understand how the choice for quality for other commodities
 in the context of this preference.
 Therefore, a dummy variable indicating whether the electricity is available
 in the region (not whether the consumer herself uses electricity or not)
 is used in the aggregated model.

 fruits-veg, protein, complements, energy, household and transport (see
 Table

), where quality measure is not used for energy, household and transport,
 the total number of equations to estimate with the seemingly unrelated
 regression is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times5+3\times1=13$

 The results confirm many of the findings from the itemwise-probit and suggest
 the relevance of asset ownership in the demand for non-durable items -
 their quality in particular.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We notice that having electricity (and assets running on electricity) has
 an influence on quality elasticities of freshfoods and protein - whereas
 other food types are not influenced by having electricity as much.
 This is likely due to the improvement of household equipment with electricity
 such as refrigerator or ovens.
 It appears that those with other household-assets (furniture etc.) do not
 seem to spend so differently on quality (except for the household related
 expenditure).
 The improved quality in food is therefore not just experienced through
 income - but through availability of electricity and more importantly -
 other assets.
 The expenditure on household category seem to actually be higher for consumers
 that are in rural areas compared to those in the urban areas - implying
 once again, that a certain items (non-electric household items in this
 case) become less relevant in the urban setting.

In conclusion, the price-based aggregation of items allows us a discussion
 of quality that is only adhoc with an item-wise approach.
 Further, the inclusion of assets and the expenditure data from recall methods
 on household-transportation helps us comment on cross-price elasticities
 for quality.
 If we model the acquisition of assets over time, then an intertemporal
 model could further enhance our understanding of overall quality over time.
 We provide a multinomial logit analysis of quality to motivate a discrete
 model for quality and asset ownership.

Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are only concerned with the status view of consumption.
 Rather than assuming the status consumption exists through conspicuous
 goods - we set to find out what status competitions look like.
 In the cost function, the expenditure for a certain utility depends on
 price of quality, minimum cost of having children (subsistence of family
 members) and the cost of long-term assets - 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p_{\kappa},p_{A},p_{\eta})$
\end_inset

.
 For us to use anything close to the AIDS form, we must explain the cost
 function with 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 .
 One way is to extend Gorman theory in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 - which is equivalent to interpreting it in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\kappa}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a direct utility function, we may write 
\begin_inset Formula $u=f(\kappa,A,\eta)$
\end_inset

.
 The discontinuity in asset ownership is a legitimate concern it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u}{\partial A}$
\end_inset

 is continuous.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u}{\partial A}$
\end_inset

 is definitely non-decreasing but it may not be differentiable the same
 way 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial u}{\partial\kappa}$
\end_inset

 is.
 Establishing an equivalence between 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\kappa}$
\end_inset

 does simplify the problem.
 One needs to separate out 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 completely to establish this equivalence.
 In the first simplification, needs are never compromised on, but quality
 is with savings.
 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(A)$
\end_inset

 is influenced by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\kappa}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\kappa,A,\eta)=g(x,p_{\kappa},p_{A},p_{\eta})$
\end_inset

.
 However, the consumer may be indifferent between many triplets of 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa,A,\eta$
\end_inset

 (somebody would drive a luxury car than pay for schools fees, would rather
 spend on designer clothes than save for a house).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The understanding of quality should be done with the cost-function under
 risk.
 When consumer's maintain low quality they could be doing so to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Invest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in items that they expect to provide returns later on.
 Quality in this sense is anything above subsistence level that is required
 for fulfillment of needs.

The general approach mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ManskiMcFadden1978"

\end_inset

 (chapter 9) is the simultaneous model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
Y_{i} & =Y_{i}B+X_{i}\Gamma+\epsilon_{i}\label{eq:simult1}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times G$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times k$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I-B$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $G\times G$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $k\times G$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

 includes latent and censored DVs as well.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is split such that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $G_{1}$
\end_inset

 are observed (continuous) variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $G_{2}-G_{1}$
\end_inset

 are limited DV
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $G_{3}-G_{2}$
\end_inset

 are unobservable latent variables (with observable 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{ji}$
\end_inset

 binary indicators that are determined by the latent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{ji}$
\end_inset

 with an indicator function as 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{ji}=\mathbb{I}(Y_{ji}>0)$
\end_inset

, where

\begin_inset Formula $\{G_{3}+1,...,G\}$
\end_inset

 which are censored by a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{3}-G_{2}$

 latent variables - can be partitioned into mutually exclusive sets 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k\in[1,L]}$

\begin_layout Standard
There are two stages in the estimation.
 The first stage estimation is through the simple manipulation of Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:simult1"

\end_inset

 - 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=\Gamma(I-B)^{-1}+\epsilon_{i}(I-B)^{-1}=X_{i}\Pi+u_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, a probit or tobit could be used.
 The second stage is the estimation of structural parameters:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=R_{i}\delta_{0}+Y_{i}^{*}\delta_{1}+\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a subvector of endogenous variables other than 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}\in\mathscr{Y}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be modified for estimation ...
