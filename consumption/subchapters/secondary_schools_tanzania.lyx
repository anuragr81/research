\begin_layout Abstract
The economies in sub-Saharan Africa often exhibit significant wealth effects
 which limit education expenditure in the region.
 Examining the severity of effect of permanent income across differing levels
 of urbanisation in Tanzania, we find that availability of secondary education
 and parental educational levels continue to be significant apart from permanent
 income measures - particularly in semi-urban areas.
 Contrasting Tanzania with other economies in sub-Saharan Africa that have
 higher urbanisation levels, the papers argues that the effects of permanent
 income may eventually weaken as the urbanisation rises in the region.

\begin_layout Standard
The participation rates for secondary and higher education remain one of
 the lowest for the economies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
 The limited outreach and success of educational institutions (

) is often attributed to wealth differences and a limited focus on non-formal
 education (

 The current paper examines the role of permanent income on education by
 focusing on spatial distribution of assets in Tanzania and finds that education
 expenses are still limited by parental education levels and availability
 of education facilities in the economy.
 Considering other economies in the region, the paper also suggests that
 changes brought with urbanisation may alleviate effects of permanent income
 on education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extent to which permanent income may contribute to education expenses
 - are commonly observed through various mechanisms (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,IliePaulineWhobenefitsfromHE2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Other than through costs at point of use, household permanent influences
 access to education through information symmetries that favour job-searches
 and representation in local institutions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The long-term wealth inequalities - which often arise due to permanent
 income differences - often cause disparities in funding of higher education
 levels - thereby creating a poverty trap for the lower-income households
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This issue is worsened due a large informal sector in sub-Saharan Africa
 where volatile incomes may further deprioritise education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011,MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

 But while the empirical literature often suggests a stronger role of wealth
 effects than physical access (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), a survey of permanent income measures (total expenditure) across spatial
 distribution of assets shows both physical access and parental educational
 levels as significant in Tanzania.

 inter-generational transfers of wealth (which cause a break in the inequality

 The urbanisation levels - on the other hand - are interpreted as wealth-concent
ration in the immediate area surrounding the household.
 The primary goal of using the regional-wealth measure for urbanisation-levels
 is to consider the

 spatial variation of wealth in the SSA.
 Observed at the district-level and based only on the market value of assets

assets
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 signifies the goods that are owned by the household.
 These constitute items that are more often referred to as durable goods
 in the consumption literature from the developed economies.
 There seem at least two reasons why the developing economics literature
 more often refers to the durable household possessions as assets.
 First, the financial assets are far less relevant in the developing economies.
 Second, the durable goods such as bicycles or stoves - however insignificant
 - are far more significant as durable goods in the developing world.

\begin_layout Standard
As such, the urbanisation levels - which we interpret as local wealth accumulati
on in a given district - influence participation in education through several
 mechanisms.
 Apart from the physical access to education i.e.
 the higher availability of education opportunities in urban areas (which
 we consider a separate control), the two fundamental mechanisms for urbanisatio
n that are relevant to the study are the relative abundance of opportunities
 for higher income employment and the social environment in the urban areas.
 The better opportunities of employment and income overall make education
 more affordable so that the households in rural areas - where incomes are
 invariably lower and education somewhat of a luxury- end up underinvesting
 in education.
 The social environment of urban areas is also often different - leading
 to a stronger need for finding education-dependent employment in urban
 areas.
 Both of these factors suggest a survey of regional wealth at finer levels
 in the economy - a measure that takes into account the role of land ownership
 in SSA that has been emphasis by the sociological literature (

Our conclusion that the role of regional wealth and parental education level
 is as significant as effects of permanent income in Tanzania relies on
 the control for physical access to education in the survey
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since secondary education has been the focus of development policy in recent
 decades (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FullerVocationalTraining1976,TilakEducationPoverty2002,TilakPostelemEducIndia2007,HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanInvestmentIndianEducUneconomic1980"

\end_inset

), the we focus in particular on the accessibility of secondary education
 in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The control often plays a critical role in determining whether a given
 amount of funds is more appropriately used to build accessible schools
 or to support and economise education instead.
 More specifically, if physical access for education is what prevents the
 attainment of education, then building more schools becomes of higher priority.
 On the other hand, if effects of permanent income are stronger in the economy,
 then affordability of education becomes an important issue notwithstanding
 the concerns for returns to education.
 The results we obtain with regional-wealth seem significant since the wealth
 effects are more often reported to be stronger than the effects of physical
 access in empirical studies from the region (

 In the context of Tanzania, we find two factors to be of particular significanc
e.
 First is the parental educational level which indicates the acquisition
 of skills (from transferred from parents) that are valued in employment
 markets (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TanselParentEducEffects1997"

\end_inset

).
 Second is the main occupation in the household - which indicate agrarian
 or non-agrarian nature of the household occupation that may provide a non-trans
actional advantage through social networks.
 We also consider the ability to speak English as a separate control which
 could indicate an exposure to education in ways that the poorer or rural
 households may not be exposed to.

An essential claim of the human capital theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is that the educational investments must change over the life cycle of
 consumers.
 The age associated with children in the household are thus considered as
 a control in the study.
 In a setting where higher education is rare, the transition to secondary
 or tertiary education is an important concern which is addressed with the
 use of category variables indicating whether there are children of school-age
 in the household or not.
 Given that large households have higher basic needs than smaller households,
 the number of children are also considered a separate control in the study.

In summary, we use the permanent income and regional-wealth as our main

Since urban households evidently have higher permanent income, a comparison
 of effects of regional wealth and permanent income is not without concerns
 of correlation.
 However, as the study is concerned only with the relative importance of
 permanent income and secondary school availability - rather than the elasticiti
es of expenditure - these issues are less relevant.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first explanatory variable (household permanent income) uses the logarithm
 of household's total annual expenditure and relies on standard consumption
 theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"

 The regional-wealth used as the second explanatory variable (see Section

 for details) and is computed as the average asset-ownership levels in the
 households' vicinity.
 Further robustness checks are conducted by redefining the regional-wealth
 measures which vary the boundaries of households vicinity and examine the
 significance of regional-wealth in the household's neighborhood of similar
 occupations (agrarian/non-agrarian) and education ranks (primary,secondary).
 In the alternative formulation - which we provide for a comparison with
 a more conventional approach using urban-rural demarcations from the survey
 - the total value of long-term assets owned by the household i.e.
 the measure of household permanent income is used as the first explanatory
 variable and a

While education may not be considered a basic necessity in all poverty-measureme
nt surveys, it is seldom disputed that a lack of education contributes to
 poverty.
 Even in the developing economies, the poorest individuals tend to have
 a strong demand for education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002,GertlerGlewwe1990WTPEduc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The literature goes as far to suggest that when education is not state-funded
 in the developing economies, there might be a compulsion - rather than
 a mere willingness - to pay for education among the poor (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002,TilakDeterminantsHouseholdexpenditureinRuralIndia2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 With a high demand for educated workforce in an industrialising economy,
 there seems little disagreement in policy therefore - whether from a human
 capital perspective (

An important consideration for education attainment in the population is
 that while higher education provides needed skills for higher incomes,
 the expenditure on education is often limited by the wealth one possesses.
 The differences in education elasticities based on income have in fact
 been emphasised in the literature early on since the mid-last century (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BensonEconomicsofPublicEduc1961,HashimotoHeathIncomeElasticityEduc1995"

 The empirical studies from the SSA also report significant wealth effects
 on education (

key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"

\end_inset

 Inspecting the enrollments data, for example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 note that the children from households that have large cattle stocks face
 less reductions in enrollment, because higher wealth may allow the households
 to take care of the cattle and prevent the childrens' withdrawals from
 schools

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the effects of household wealth remain significant in SSA, much of
 the discussion on the high graduate unemployment and low higher-education
 participation has focused on the poor returns to education in the region.
 On one hand, the literature attributes these problems to the prevalent
 mismanagement in public education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and on the other it highlights a misplaced focus on formal education in
 the informal economy settings (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Instead of focusing on the returns-to-education, we argue that the poor
 returns may not offer a complete view of lower participation in education.
 One reason is that the education needs or perceived value of education
 may not be adequately captured with a returns-to-education approach.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 point out, the returns-to-education approaches tend to ignore the positive
 externalities from education.
 The other reason is simply that the role of physical access and wealth
 may be far more dominant than the issue of poor returns-to-education in
 an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive externalities from education - which one may use to argue that
 the returns-to-education perspective is an incomplete one - seem less of
 an issue in the context of SSA where empirical studies often report several
 instances of waste in rent-seeking after graduation (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oketchAfricaHE2016,MinnisNonformalEducation2006,dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While it is beyond doubt that returns-to-education are an important concern,
 we argue that they do need to be viewed in the context of wealth effects
 and availability of education facilities.
 It is possible for the demand for education to be suppressed due to inadequate
 income (relatively high prices of education) in the economy or a sparse
 distribution of education opportunities rather than due to lower pay from
 post-education employment opportunities alone (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Thus if education expenditures are better explained with physical access,
 then the policy may need to focus on building more accessible schools.
 On the other hand, if effects of permanent income are more significant,
 then there is a need to make education more affordable for the lower-income
 households.
 The choice between the two is hardly mutual exclusive - but indicates merely
 the relative significance of the options which the policy faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While empirical studies have found more often that the physical access is
 less significant than the wealth effects (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,KambonBusbyEducationPoverty2000,ObasuyiEducationInequality2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) in the context of SSA, there is also evidence that the effects of physical
 access do become stronger at higher (secondary and tertiary) levels of
 education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NgwareOnsomuKenyaSecEd2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The effect of urban-rural differences - which may be correlated with difference
 in both physical access and regional-wealth - has also been widely reported
 to be significant in SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "IliePaulineWhobenefitsfromHE2018,castrolealPoorBenefitAfricaEducation1999,GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BossuroyCogneauMobilityAfrica2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Both regional wealth and permanent income (aside from the physical access
 to education used as a control) - are thus important concerns in the study
 - that we examine to consider the relative importance of effects of permanent
 income with respect to physical access.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to interpret the effect of a standardised regional-wealth measure
 is of contrasting local vs wider wealth disparities which prevent access
 to education.
 From this perspective, the regional-wealth based analysis examines whether
 a wealthier locality has a stronger influence on education than household
 permanent income (total expenditure) or not (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "EbaidallaSudanHHeducExpenditure2018,DonkohDeterminantsHHEducExpenditure2011"

key "BayarDeterminantsEducTurkey2016,KnightEducationalattainmentRuralUrbanChina1996,AcarHHEducTurkey2016"

 for role of urban-rural effects in education disparities).
 The dichotomy is also useful in understanding how the social environment
 of more urbanised areas could influence education expenses (e.g.
 by creating a more competitive setting for education).

The effects of social environment on education may have been only recently

 refinements have focused more often on the specific role played by social
 networks and parental acquisitions or skills (

 rather than high-culture-participation that affects school performance
 in Netherlands.
 More importantly, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 background with explicit measures of resources accessible to the students.
 In another study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 point out that higher educated parents invariably spend more time with
 children - a social factor that contributes to how parental education levels
 influence the next generation.
 In fact, the high-culture participation does not always influence educational
 performance positively either.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 in South Korea as it takes time off from study.
 In most cases, the cultural factors thus seem to matter in education only
 through economic factors that are relevant for participation in education.
 Recent literature is thus more often concerned with a

In summary, the literature observes several factors - such as the pro-rich
 nature of education, an insufficient focus on informal economy, mismanagement
 in public expenditure on education and poor returns after graduation -
 that may simultaneously contribute to lower education expenses and poorer
 participation in SSA.
 While permanent income effects may be of overall concern, the availability
 of secondary education institutions in semi-urban and rural regions may
 be worth more attention in some economies.
 At last, it's worth remarking also that the economic context of SSA has
 certain implications for education expenses that are beyond the purview
 of an education policy.
 The high-land labour ratios (

The goal of our empirical analysis is to compare permanent income effects
 on education expenses with that of regional wealth in Tanzania.
 The regional differences in the country are represented primarily with
 the regional-wealth measure
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Other measures such as cost-of-living or secondary-school availability could
 also indicate regional variation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the main formulation, the logarithm of total expenditure is used as
 the main explanatory variable while the regional-wealth - the second explanator
y variable - is calculated as the average assets in the consumer's district
 (for smaller districts, the average over multiple districts within a 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 boundary is taken).
 In the alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators - which we
 provide for a comparison with a more conventional approach - the two explanator
y variables are the wealth based on durable goods from the survey and an
 ruralness score based on urban-rural indicators themselves.
 The measures for regional-wealth (as well as the first explanatory variable
 in the alternative formulation) rely on the market-value of durable goods
 (including land, housing) that are reported in the survey (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 It is worth highlighting that the durable goods are considered as part
 of the consumer wealth only if they are transferable over generations.
 The ownership of goods that won't last more than a lifetime enter as consumptio
n for the household rather than as assets contributing to the intergenerational
 wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the econometric model, the representative household balances i) her non-durab
le consumption (excluding education) with ii) increasing expenditure on
 education for the children.
 The non-durable consumption that the household may spend on excludes the
 expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The consumer budget thus consists of the educational expenses and non-durable
 consumption excluding assets-related-costs.
 In the model for cross-sectional comparison of education expenses, we do
 not consider the substitution with savings towards durable goods

 to households having one or more children.
 In other words, only households with at least one member with their age
 less than 18 are considered in the analysis.
 The number of children (household-size), the educational level of the parents,
 the accessibility of schools in the district and the language spoken are
 the important controls used in the analyses.
 For the paternal educational levels, we use an educational rank that is
 standardised by differentiating between primary, secondary and higher education

% To recap, the wealth-concentration interpretation of urbanisation - which
 interprets urbanisation as concentration of long-term asset ownership in
 a 6-km area is used while measuring wealth effects with household wealth
 - whereas the conventional urban-rural classification is used while measuring
 wealth-effects using assets-ownership.
 This 6-km scale in the district where the household residence is located
 - is based on the geographical distances between districts and the average
 distance to the education facility recorded in the consumption survey.The
 population density based approaches have been avoided due to issues arising

 The survey is unique in its aims to improve the understanding of links

 and agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys is often geo-referenced with a sufficiently wide-span
 to allow for a study of spatial variation in the observed variables.

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited, we focus on durable goods that can be transferred over a generation.
 We therefore include items as long-term assets only if they are costlier
 than furniture - which is the cheapest asset to be transferred between
 the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 These costs are used both for the regional-wealth measures and the assets-measu

The regional-wealth measure by averaging the ownership of assets over district-l

 The calculation of the measure uses the geo-coding of districts in the
 survey.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014, we do not use the rural field for analysis at the wider-dis
trict level aggregation and use a variable indicating how rural the consumer's
 vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards in the 6

 More specifically, a score 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 for each district represents the number of wards that have a secondary
 school within the 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 area.
 A district with a higher score has more wards that have a secondary school
 in close vicinity (within 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 vicinity).
 This measure takes care of the issue that there are many wards (and enumerated-
areas within) having consumer entries for assets and consumption that the
 school-availability (primary as well as secondary ) is not recorded for.
 The aggregation over districts takes care of this issue since there are
 no districts with consumer entries for assets and consumption that we don't
 have the total number (score) of secondary-schools for.
 This score evidently also factors in the high-population density in urban
 areas since densely populated districts would have more wards within the
 same geographical distance as a less populated district.
 It is worth stating that score is likely to have some correlation with
 measures of local prosperity - such as regional-wealth or local-price-index.

\begin_layout Standard
Tanzania is a country on the east coast of sub-Saharan Africa - spreading
 over nearly 885,800 sq km of land of which nearly 43% is agricultural whereas
 of 37% of the land is forest land (a much higher proportion if compared
 to a more industrialised economy in sub-Saharan Africa such as that of
 Nigeria with nearly 78% agricultural land).
 The country's population was 59.7 million in 2020 (source: World Bank) the
 growth rate remains under 3%.
 While there are wide disparities in wealth and a relatively higher Gini-coeffic
ient for household income (40.5 based on a 2017 estimate), the youth unemployment
 at 3.9% is relatively lower compared to other economies in the region.
 About 26.4% of the population is recorded to live below the poverty line
 (2017 estimate) in the country and only 36.7% of the population is considered
 urban.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the overall distribution of education expenses in the data from
 LSMS, we see that the urban residents spend much higher on education than
 the rural residents in Tanzania (2.8 times more).
 About 20% (25% in rural areas) of those with age between 6 and 18 have
 never attended school.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for tertiary education (rank 3) is almost
 double that of the expenditure on secondary education (rank 2) in Tanzania.
 The educational expenses seem to rather unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartEducationbyAssetDeciles"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The role of private education does not appear strong in the country (see
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) as less than 10% of households seem to access private schools.

It is worth remarking that the occupation ranks shown in Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 are based on the standardisation of various occupations in Tanzania.
 Since the range of occupations in the survey is varied, the different occupatio
ns have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey so that
 a higher occupation rank represents an occupation that provides higher
 income.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and the reporting
 of occupations in the survey
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is not uncommon for the empirical studies in SSA to have the data on
 occupation or education proxy the income differences (Alesina et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem
 that may be further aggravated because of a large informal sectors in the
 economies.

 To resolve this disparity, we avoid using the education rank of the HH

[IT NEEDS TO MORE ELEGANTLY STATED THAT THE EFFECT OF REGIONAL WEALTH AND
 SECONDARY_SCHOOLS is SIMILAR and that they are representing the same things]
 Since richer areas should generally have more secondary schools (even though
 the observed correlation between secondary_schools and is nearly 0.2), we
 interpret the effect of secondary-schools together with that of asset density.
 As such the regional-wealth measure ( 
\family typewriter
regionalwealth 
\family default
 ) has a strong and positive influence on educational budget shares 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset


\family default
 (see coefficients of

\family default
 under columns HH and INDIV in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 ).
 Notice however that the regional disparities indicated by 
\family typewriter
regionalwealth 
\family default
 could also be implied by the secondary-schools variable ( 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 ) or the non-durable consumption prices 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 (since richer areas are more likely to have more secondary schools and
 higher prices).
 While the non-durable consumption prices (
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 ) have a weak effect on education-budget share 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset


\family default
 and

\begin_inset Formula $w_{j,educ}$
\end_inset

), the effect of the second-schools variable ( 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 ) seems strong and negative.
 This suggests that having more secondary schools in a region decreases
 the budget share 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
for both individuals and households (see coefficients for secondary-school
 
\family typewriter

\family default
under INDIV and HH in Table

\end_inset

).
 This effect of 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 in fact is similar to that of total expenditure ( 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp)
\family default
 in that the areas with more secondary education opportunities tend to have
 proportionality higher total expenditure and lower budget shares.
 Still, the overall effect of asset-richness is positive on budget shares
 (see coefficients of

\begin_layout Plain Layout

) .
 In other words, richer neighborhoods have a higher budget-share for education
 even after accounting for physical access to education (availability of
 secondary education measured with 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
) - an effect that incorporates various environmental factors associated
 with richer areas - such as a competition towards higher income social
 positions or presence of occupations requiring higher levels of education.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The role of the number of children (

 The switching of signs between household (column HH in Table

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 expenditure on child declines when there are more children added to the
 household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The role of parental education levels

 The results for the household show that households that the children of
 an age suitable for secondary school do have higher budget share on education
 over all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It also appears that among households with the same educational-status that
 reside in areas of similar regional-wealth, the education budget-shares
 for children in agrarian households is slightly lower (see coefficients

 This effect is however not strong at the household level.
 We note also that the effect of female indicator variable (
\family typewriter
1.is_female
\family default

 However, there is some evidence that poor households may spend less on
 education for female children (see the later results under robustness measures

\begin_layout Standard
Except for observations related to

regionalwealth 
\family default
, many of the the above observations are verified with the alternative formulati
on using the logarithm of assets-worth (

\family default

 For example, the effects of agrarian-occupation-indicator 
\family typewriter

 While effect of

 overall have lower budget shares on education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the role of English language seems significant in Tanzania.
 The English-speakers spend significantly higher on education (see coefficients

 That said, it needs to be clarified that the role of social characteristics
 may be rather inseparable from differences in educational institutions.
 In other words, the role of an English-speaking parent may only be a reflection
 of the disparity of access to educational facilities in the economy.

To confirm that household permanent income does affect access to education
 despite the regional disparities and investigate factors that influence
 poorer populations more than richer populations within a locality, we inspect
 the role of assets in lower and higher sub-samples of the surveyed population.
 We thus re-estimate the results with regiona-wealth 
\family typewriter
regionalwealth 
\family default
 as the explanatory variable for those with less than the local median wealth
 i.e.
 assets-worth logarithm 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_assets
\family default
 and for those above it.
 The results show that certain social and regional influence both richer
 and poorer halves of the populations whereas factors such as the private
 or tertiary-level education favour the richer sub-populations.
 The results for above and below local median-assets possession using education
 budget-shares

 for both above and below median assets-possession levels.

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the effects of both regional-wealth 
\family typewriter
regionalwealth 
\family default
 and total expenditure 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_exp
\family default
 on education budget shares for rich and poor halves in a locality are largely
 similar (see coefficients of

\family default
 under HH and INDIV in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{tabTNZ_abovebelow_median}

\end_inset

 for both above and below median assets-possession levels).
 The access to private education and higher parental education level seem
 to matter only to the richer households (the economic significance of private-e
ducation factor variable 
\family typewriter
educpriv 
\family default
is consistently higher for richer households under both HH and INDIV in
 Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{tabTNZ_abovebelow_median}

 ).
 Similarly, the effect of agricultural-occupation of the household head
 seems is stronger in the poorer half of the population (compare coefficients
 of 
\family typewriter

between those with above and below median assets-possession levels under
 HH and INDIV in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

 The higher statistical significance of the number of children 
\family typewriter

for poorer households (see coefficients of

) suggests a higher sensitivity of budget-shares to 
\family typewriter

\family default
 for lower income households.
 The local prices 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 has a similar effect on education budget shares for poorer households (see
 coefficients of

 for below median assets-possession under HH in Table

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The significance of other social factors remains unaffected by whether the
 consumers have above or below the median asset ownership level.
 More specifically, the factor variable for English-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english

 is significant for both richer and poorer households (see coefficients
 of 
\family typewriter
has_english
\family default
 for below median assets-possession in Table

 Similarly, the effects of secondary-schools

 for both richer and poorer halves of population in a given locality.
 We see again that while budget-shares for a female-child education remain
 slightly lower (see coefficient of

To check whether the wealth effect may weaken significantly relative to
 regional and social effects after accounting for occupation or education
 levels or not, we recompute the regional-wealth measure by considering
 only two types of vicinity.
 The first type being one where the asset-possessions of households in the
 same district (within 6-km boundary) having the same value of an indicator
 for primary/higher-than-primary education-level of the household-head are
 considered for asset-density.
 The second type being one where the asset-possession of households with
 the same value for the agrarian/non-agrarian occupation indicator are considere
d for asset-density.

% POSSIBLE READD: The weakening of wealth effects with rising urbanisation
 could point in a promising direction through rise in employment opportunities

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of our analysis has been to compare the relative importance of
 secondary level education availability and parental educational effects
 against effects of household permanent income in Tanzania.
 We find overall that the availability of secondary education and parental
 education levels remain a strong factor when considering the variation
 in urbanisation levels in the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The varying levels of regional wealth allow us to explore the challenges
 that improvement of employment opportunities and economic development bring
 towards access to education in the region.
 Even though the literature often notes a higher significance of wealth
 effects, the consideration of regional-wealth suggests that role of physical
 access and parental education level may continue to be important in economies
 that exhibit wide disparities in urbanisation levels.
 If effects of permanent income mattered less in the urbanised areas (after
 controlling for physical access), a policy could direct its attention to
 improving physical access instead but since the results show that effects
 of permanent income continue to be significance despite higher economic
 development in urbanised regions, the improvement of access to education
 for lower-income households must go hand-in-hand with expansion of education
 institutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[IT NEEDS TO REPHRASED - whether how the comparison with NIGERIA is actually
 being done ] A focus on availability of education facilities and of parental
 education levels is critical also because private educational institutions
 do not yet play a major role in the provision of education in the economy.
 The strong role of social differences indicated by the significance of
 social characteristics in education expenses - further emphasises the need
 to improve wider access to secondary education.
 These findings seems aligned with the wider observations for the region
 made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 who elaborate on the significant role of religious and colonial institutions
 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.
\end_layout

On other hand, we also find quite high education budget-shares for agrarian
 households in Tanzania - confirming similar findings from other empirical
 investigations in the region (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006,porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Given the optimism towards future income equity offered by the resulting
 higher educational levels, there are reasons to argue that permanent income
 effects would weaken with rise in urbanisation (often suggested by conventional
 pathways to urban development in the literature - 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KuznetsEconomicGrowthIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 A comparison of Tanzania with the economies from SSA that have experienced
 a more widespread urbanisation and a higher dependence on industrial production
 also suggests that the overall effect of urbanisation may be positive towards
 weakening of permanent income effects on education.

In summary, we find that while the permanent income effects do remain strong
 in Tanzania, both secondary-school access and parental education levels
 play a major role for education expenses.
 The relevance of regional-wealth in the population having higher education
 levels may point to a promising albeit precarious direction where more
 urbanisation could improve access to education and employment opportunities
 in the region while increasing expenses on education overall.
