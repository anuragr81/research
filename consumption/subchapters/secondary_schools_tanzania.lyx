\begin_layout Abstract
The economies in sub-Saharan Africa often exhibit significant wealth effects
 that limit education expenditure and wider access to education in the region.
 Examining the severity of wealth effects across differing levels of urbanisatio
n in Tanzania, we find that availability of secondary education continues
 to be of higher significance than wealth - particularly in semi-urban areas.
 Compared with countries with higher levels of urbanisation in sub-Saharan
 Africa, role of wealth effects may be weakening with rising urbanisation.

\end_inset

 The current paper re-examines the role of wealth effects on education in
 the region by using a spatial distribution of assets in in Tanzania - finding
 that the education expenses are limited more often by availability of education
 facilities than wealth differences.
 A comparison with other countries in the region also suggests that changes
 brought with urbanisation may act to reduce or worsen wealth effects on
 education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wealth effects on education - the extent to which the household wealth
 contributes to education expenses - are commonly observed through various
 mechanisms (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,IliePaulineWhobenefitsfromHE2018"

\end_inset

).
 Other than through costs at point of use, household wealth also influences
 access to education through information symmetries that favour job-searches
 and representation in local institutions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As higher intergenerational wealth also helps fund higher education levels,
 wealth inequalities tend to become educational inequalities by creating
 a poverty trap for the lower-income households (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"

\end_inset

) - a concern that has been important for policy in SSA (particularly due
 to a large informal sector where volatility in income deprioritises education
 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011,MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

 But while the empirical literature often suggests a stronger role of wealth
 effects than physical access for education expenses in the literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"

), a survey of educational expenses across spatial distribution of assets
 shows that the availability of education facilities remains of strong significa
nce in Tanzania - particularly in its poorer or semi-urban regions.

Instead of using income-data, the empirical studies for education more often
 rely on the data on ownership of assets (

 The urbanisation levels - on the other hand - are interpreted as that of
 wealth-concentration in the immediate area surrounding the household.
 Using wealth-concentration measure as as urbanisation-level takes into
 consideration the

 Observed at the district-level and based only on the market value of assets
 held by households, the measure addresses concerns with spatial inferences

 signifies the goods that are owned by the household.
 These constitute items that are more often referred to as durable goods
 in the consumption literature from the developed economies.
 There seem at least two reasons why the developing economics literature
 more often refers to the durable household possessions as assets.
 First, the financial assets are far less relevant in the developing economies.
 Second, the durable goods such as bicycles or stoves - however insignificant
 - are far more significant as durable goods in the developing world.

As such, the urbanisation levels influence participation in education through
 several mechanisms.
 Setting aside the physical access to education i.e.
 the higher availability of education opportunities in urban areas (considered
 a separate control), the two fundamental mechanisms for urbanisation that
 the paper focuses on are the relative abundance of opportunities for higher
 income employment and the social environment in the urban areas.
 The better opportunities of employment and wealth overall make education
 more affordable so that the households in rural areas - where incomes are
 invariably lower and education somewhat of a luxury- end up underinvesting
 in education.
 The social environment of urban areas is also often different - leading
 to a stronger need for finding education-dependent employment in urban
 areas.
 Banking on the sociological literature emphasising the role of land ownership
 in SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShiptonGoheenLandAfrica1992,AbayYoungRuralEconomy2021,KoseGhebruLandEthiopia2018"

), the positive externalities from being in a rich locality are tracked
 using the measure relying on concentration of assets-ownership in the study.

\begin_layout Standard
The finding that wealth effects are more severe in less urbanised areas
 rests on the physical access to education - a control which directly influences
 education expenditure.
 Since secondary education has been the focus of development policy in recent
 decades (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FullerVocationalTraining1976,TilakEducationPoverty2002,TilakPostelemEducIndia2007,HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanInvestmentIndianEducUneconomic1980"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the study focuses particularly on the accessibility of secondary education
 in Tanzania.
 The physical access control often plays a critical role in determining
 whether a given amount of funds is more appropriately used to build accessible
 schools or to support and economise education instead.
 More specifically, if physical access for education is what prevents the
 attainment of education, then building more schools becomes of higher priority.
 On the other hand, if wealth effects are stronger in the economy, then
 affordability of education becomes an important issue - even if returns
 to education were a cause of concern.
 Whether returns to education are enough to increase education participation
 for lower-income households or not - also often hinges on there being less
 significant wealth effects and sufficient physical access to education
 in an economy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 The results we obtain with urbanisation levels seem significant as the
 wealth effects are more often reported to be stronger than the effects
 of physical access in empirical studies from the region (

 While early attempts to explain the role of social factors seem to have
 advanced the notion of social capital (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "BourdieuCulturalRepr2018"

 In the particular context of Tanzania, two factors seem of particular significa
nce.
 First is the parental educational level which indicates the acquisition
 of skills (from transferred from parents) that are valued in employment
 markets (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TanselParentEducEffects1997"

\end_inset

).
 Second is the main occupation in the household - which indicate agrarian
 or non-agrarian nature of the household occupation that may provide a non-trans
actional advantage through social networks.
 We also consider the ability to speak English as a separate control which
 could indicate an exposure to education in ways that the poorer or rural
 households may not be exposed to.

An essential claim of the human capital theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is that the educational investments must change over the life cycle of
 consumers.
 The age associated with children in the household are thus considered as
 a control in the study.
 In a setting where higher education is rare, the transition to secondary
 or tertiary education is an important concern and justifies the use of
 category variables indicating whether there are children of school-age
 in the household or not.
 Given that large households have higher basic needs than smaller households,
 the number of children are also considered a separate control in the study.

In summary, the household wealth and urbanisation levels are the main explanator

 access to education, the social or demographic factors and the household
 characteristics serve as important controls
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since urban households evidently have higher wealth, a comparison of urbanisatio
n and wealth effects is not without concerns of a correlation between household
 wealth and urbanisation.
 However, as the study is concerned only with the relative importance of
 urbanisation and permanent income measures in the two countries - rather
 than the elasticities of expenditure, these issues are less relevant to
 the comparison of household educational expenditure.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first explanatory variable i.e.
 the wealth or the permanent income of the household relies on standard
 consumption theory to use the logarithm of household's total annual expenditure
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 The urbanisation levels correspond to a wealth-concentration measure that
 is used as the second explanatory variable (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details) - and corresponds to the average asset-ownership levels in
 the households' vicinity.
 The physical access to education - is measured with the number of secondary
 schools in every district so that a higher score of 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 for a district implies more secondary schools in the district.
 Further robustness checks are conducted by redefining the wealth concentration
 measures which vary the boundaries of households vicinity and examine the
 significance of wealth-concentration in the household's neighborhood of
 similar occupations (agrarian/non-agrarian) and education ranks (primary,second
ary).
 In the alternative formulation - which we provide for a comparison with
 a more conventional approach using urban-rural demarcations from the survey
 - the total value of long-term assets owned by the household i.e.
 the measure of household wealth is used as the first explanatory variable
 and a

ruralness

 score based on urban-rural indicators from the survey is used as the second
 explanatory variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The varying levels of urbanisation allows us to explore the challenges that
 improvement of employment opportunities and economic development may bring
 towards access to education in the region.
 If wealth effects matter less in the urbanised areas (after controlling
 for physical access), then education policy may need to direct its attention
 to improving physical access.
 On other hand, if wealth effects are significant despite higher economic
 development in urbanised regions, then more attention is needed for improvement
 of access to education for lower-income households.
 The results from the paper indicate that the role of availability of education
 is more important than wealth effects in the semi-urban regions of Tanzania.
 They also suggest that despite the challenges of overpopulation and income
 inequalities, urbanisation may have a positive role overall so long as
 it raises employment opportunities and income (

While education may not be considered a basic necessity in all poverty-measureme

 poverty.
 Even in the developing economies, the poorest individuals tend to have
 a strong demand for education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002,GertlerGlewwe1990WTPEduc"

 The literature goes as far to suggest that when education is not state-funded
 in the developing economies, there might be a compulsion - rather than
 a mere willingness - to pay for education among the poor (

key "TilakEducationPoverty2002,TilakDeterminantsHouseholdexpenditureinRuralIndia2002"

 With a high demand for educated workforce in an industrialising economy,
 there seems little disagreement in policy therefore - whether from a human
 capital perspective (

An important consideration for education attainment in the population is
 that while higher education provides needed skills for higher incomes,
 the expenditure on education is often limited by the wealth one possesses.
 The differences in education elasticities based on income have in fact
 been emphasised in the literature early on since the mid-last century (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BensonEconomicsofPublicEduc1961,HashimotoHeathIncomeElasticityEduc1995"

 The empirical studies from the SSA also report significant wealth effects
 on education (

 Inspecting the enrollments data, for example,

 note that the children from households that have large cattle stocks face

\begin_layout Standard
While the wealth-effects remain significant in SSA, much of the discussion
 on the high graduate unemployment and low higher-education participation
 has focused on the poor returns to education in the region.
 On one hand, the literature attributes these problems to the prevalent
 mismanagement in public education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and on the other it highlights a misplaced focus on formal education in
 the informal economy settings (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Instead of focusing on the returns-to-education, we argue that the poor
 returns may not offer a complete view of lower participation in education.
 One reason is that the education needs or perceived value of education
 may not be adequately captured with a returns-to-education approach.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 point out, the returns-to-education approaches tend to ignore the positive
 externalities from education.
 The other reason is simply that the role of physical access and wealth
 may be far more dominant than the issue of poor returns-to-education in
 an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive externalities from education - which one may use to argue that
 the returns-to-education perspective is an incomplete one - are less of
 an issue in the context of SSA.
 Many empirical studies in fact have reported several instances of waste
 in rent-seeking activities after graduation in the SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oketchAfricaHE2016,MinnisNonformalEducation2006,dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While it is beyond doubt that returns-to-education are an important concern,
 they do need to be viewed in the context of wealth effects and availability
 of education facilities.
 It is possible for the demand for education to be suppressed due to inadequate
 income (relatively high prices of education) in the economy or a sparse
 distribution of education opportunities rather than due to lower pay from
 post-education employment opportunities alone (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, if education expenditures are better explained with physical
 access, then the policy may need to focus on building more accessible schools.
 On the other hand, if wealth-effects are more significant, then there is
 a need to make education more affordable for the lower-income households.
 The choice between the two is hardly one that is mutual exclusive - but
 merely indicates the relative significance of the options faced by policy.

While empirical studies have found more often that the physical access is
 less significant than the wealth effects (

 access do become stronger at higher (secondary and tertiary) levels of
 education (

 The effect of urban-rural differences - which may be correlated with difference
 in both physical access and wealth concentration - has also been widely
 reported to be significant in SSA (

 Both urbanisation-levels and wealth (aside from the physical access to
 education used as a control) - are thus important concerns in the study
 and that we examine to consider the relative importance of wealth effects
 with respect to physical access.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to interpret the effect of a standardised wealth-concentration-based
 measure of urban-rural differences is of contrasting local vs wider wealth
 disparities which prevent access to education.
 From this perspective, the wealth-concentration based analysis examines
 whether a wealthier locality has a stronger influence on education than
 household income (indicate by total expenditure) or not (see

 The dichotomy could also useful in explaining how the social environment
 of more urbanised areas could influence education expenses (e.g.
 by creating a more competitive setting for education).

The effects of social environment on education may have been only recently
 elaborated in the literature from SSA (

 post-war era (

 While this early research had viewed education as a certain high-culture
 participation which enhances the social capital of a household, the later
 refinements have focused more often on the specific role played by social
 networks and parental acquisitions or skills (

 rather than high-culture-participation that affects school performance
 in Netherlands.
 More importantly, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 argue, it is possible to explain a significant part of parental social
 background with explicit measures of resources accessible to the students.
 In another study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 point out that higher educated parents invariably spend more time with
 children - a social factor that contributes to how parental education levels
 influence the next generation.
 In fact, the high-culture participation does not always influence educational
 performance positively either.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ByunTheseisCulturalCapitalSouthKorea2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find, the high-culture participation affects educational performance negatively
 in South Korea as it takes time off from study.
 In most cases, the cultural factors thus seem to matter in education only
 through economic factors that are relevant for participation in education.
 Recent literature is thus more often concerned with a

 that of urbanisation, paternal characteristics (paternal education-level,
 occupation etc.) and other household factors (language spoken).

In summary, the literature observes several factors - such as the pro-rich
 nature of education, an insufficient focus on informal economy, mismanagement
 in public expenditure on education and poor returns after graduation -
 that may simultaneously contribute to lower education expenses and poorer
 participation in SSA.
 While wealth effects may be of overall concern, the availability of secondary
 education institutions in semi-urban and rural regions may be worth more
 attention in some economies.
 At last, it's worth remarking also that the economic context of SSA has
 certain implications for education expenses that are beyond the purview
 of an education policy.
 The high-land labour ratios (

The goal of our empirical analysis is to find out physical access is more
 than wealth effects on education expenses rather in an economy with varied
 levels of urbanisation.
 The paper relies primarily on a wealth-concentration measure of urbanisation
 levels - while providing results from a formulation based on urban-rural
 indicators for comparison.
 In the main formulation, the logarithm of total expenditure is used as
 the main explanatory variable while the wealth concentration measure -
 the second explanatory variable - is calculated as the average assets in
 the consumer's district (for smaller districts, the average over multiple
 districts within a 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 boundary is taken).
 In the alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators, the two explanator
y variables are the wealth based on durable goods from the survey and an
 ruralness score based on urban-rural indicators themselves.
 The measures for wealth-concentration (as well as the first explanatory
 variable in the alternative formulation) rely on the market-value of durable
 goods (including land, housing) that are reported in the survey (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 It is worth highlighting that the durable goods are considered as part
 of the consumer wealth only if they are transferable over generations.
 The ownership of goods that won't last more than a lifetime enter as consumptio
n for the household rather than as assets contributing to the intergenerational
 wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
In a simple econometric model
\bar default
, the representative household balances i) her non-durable consumption (excludin
g education) with ii) increasing expenditure on education for the children.
 The non-durable consumption that the household may spend on excludes the
 expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and non-durable consumption excluding assets-related-c
osts thus form the consumer budget in the model.
 In this model for cross-sectional comparison of education expenses, we
 do not consider the substitution with savings towards durable goods.
 Other than our focus on cross-sectional effects, another reason why we
 avoid panel methods in the current study is a severe measurement error
 with time-varying household asset values in the survey (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details of asset values recorded in the consumption microdata).
 More specifically, the variation in time of ownership of assets is not
 accurate enough for us to measure the changing value of household assets
 possessions - due to the inconsistent recalls of the number of assets over
 time for the same household.

It is worth highlighting that the econometric analysis is limited for households
 having one or more children.
 In other words, only households with at least one member with their age
 less than 18 are considered in the analysis.
 Since the households with lower working age are likely to have less accumulatio
ns as well as needs, the average paternal age in the household is also used
 as a control in the comparison.
 The number of children (household-size), the educational level of the parents,
 the accessibility of schools in the district and the language spoken are
 other important controls used in the analyses.
 For the paternal educational levels, we use an educational rank that is
 standardised by differentiating between primary, secondary and higher education
al levels (see Section

% To recap, the wealth-concentration interpretation of urbanisation - which
 interprets urbanisation as concentration of long-term asset ownership in
 a 6-km area is used while measuring wealth effects with household wealth
 - whereas the conventional urban-rural classification is used while measuring
 wealth-effects using assets-ownership.
 This 6-km scale in the district where the household residence is located
 - is based on the geographical distances between districts and the average
 distance to the education facility recorded in the consumption survey.The
 population density based approaches have been avoided due to issues arising
 of densely populated rural areas in SSA economies ([#hendersonurbanizationSAADi

 the World Bank.
 The survey is unique in its aims to improve the understanding of links

 and agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys from multiple countries is largely uniform in its
 data-model (fields) and is often geo-referenced with a sufficiently wide-covera
ge in the country to allow a study of spatial variation in the observed
 variables.
 The years used for the cross-section analyses are the most recent years

The wealth concentration measure - which acts as measure for urbanisation

 (calculated as per the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited, we focus on durable goods that can be transferred over a generation.
 We therefore include items as long-term assets only if they are costlier
 than furniture - which is the cheapest asset to be transferred between
 the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 These costs are used both for the wealth-concentration measures and the

 total expenditure at the household level.

The geo-coding of districts is used for the averaging of assets at the consumer'

 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014, we do not use the rural field for analysis at the wider-dis
trict level aggregation and use a variable indicating how rural the consumer's
 vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards in the 6

The physical access to education is measured using the distance to the nearest

 More specifically, a score 
\family typewriter

 for each district represents the number of wards that have a secondary

\end_inset

 area.
 A district with a higher score has more wards that have a secondary school
 in close vicinity (within 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 vicinity).
 This measure takes care of the issue that there are many wards (and enumerated-
areas within) having consumer entries for assets and consumption that the
 school-availability (primary as well as secondary ) is not recorded for.
 The aggregation over districts takes care of this issues there are no district
 with consumer entries for assets and consumption that we don't have the
 total number (score) of secondary-schools for.
 This score evidently also factors in the high-population density in urban
 areas since densely populated districts would have more wards within the
 same geographical distance as a less populated district.

 Whether an occupational sector is agriculture-related or not determined

 The number of children in the household, the ages of the children (and
 other members) are directly observed in the data.
 Since the typical household unit in Tanzania and Nigeria may not be a nuclear
 family, the paternal educational level - which is another important control
 in the study - cannot simply be the education level of the household head(HH).
 This is because unlike for nuclear families, the individuals on whom the
 household's reported  education expenses are spent, could be the grandchildren
 (rather than children) of the joint-family household-head.
 To avoid letting the household's paternal education level point to the
 generation before the parents of children for certain joint-family households
 - where the HH has his/her grandchildren attending school - while letting
 the same variable point to the parents of children in school for nuclear-famili

 and corresponds to the education rank 2 ; all standards above D7 and before
 O course (Diploma) correspond to the education rank 3 and all education
 levels at or above O course correspond to education rank 4 for Tanzania.
 Similarly, the levels above P6 - which is the highest primary education
 level in Nigeria - implies an education rank 3 (corresponding to P6 in
 Tanzania) and all education levels at or above the technical training level

 rank 4.

The languages spoken (

 in Tanzania) and the religious-identity for household members (
\family typewriter
religion
\family default
 in Nigeria) - used as controls - are recorded at the individual's level
 in the survey data for the countries and are directly used as controls
 in the survey.
 To control for the price of consumption in the household's district, we
 also use the non-durable consumption averages 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 (excluding the costs associated with ownership of assets in the survey).
 The measurement 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne

 of price is akin to the price-deflator (unit-value) methods used in the
 demand literature (

).
 The rationale for excluding costs associated with assets is that the costs
 of maintaining assets (fees, repair costs, usage costs etc.) are not levied
 on those who don't own the related assets and should not be included in
 the general price of non-durable consumption.

\begin_layout Standard
Despite similarities in geographic areas, age-distribution of populations,
 public infrastructure and use of English as the primary administrative
 language, the economies of the two countries on Eastern and Western coasts
 of Africa exhibit quite a few structural differences - owing primarily
 to levels of industrialisation and endowments in natural resources.
 Tanzania is spread over nearly 885,800 sq km of land while Nigeria sprawls
 over 910,768 sq km of total land.
 The age-distribution of the populations and the dependency ratio are similar
 in the two economies while the population growth rate remains under 3%.
 As of 2020, Nigeria had a population of 206.1 million and Tanzania's population
 was 59.7 million (source: World Bank).
 The differences in public infrastructure do not appear to be extremely
 wide - since Tanzania has a total of 145,203 km length of roadways while
 Nigeria has 195,000 km (based on a 2022 estimate).
 With nearly 43% of land in Tanzania being agricultural and over 37% of
 the land being forest land (based on a 2018 estimate), urban residents
 are more numerous in Nigeria - where agricultural land is nearly 78% of
 the total land and leaves only 9.5% of forest land.
 Only 36.7% of the population is urban in Tanzania whereas urban residents
 constitute 53.5% of the population in Nigeria (2022 estimates).
 The differences in urbanisation levels across the two economies seem stable
 - since the rate of urbanisation is nearly the same in the two economies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher urbanisation in Nigeria is not without severe disparities in
 living standards.
 The infant-mortality in Nigeria (56.68 /1000) - for example - is in fact
 nearly double that of Tanzania (30.87/1000) and the per-capita availability
 of physicians remains lower in Nigeria (0.38/1000) relative to Tanzania
 (0.7/1000).
 The overall literacy is slightly better in Tanzania as well - with 77.9%
 population considered literate (above 15 years of age having the ability
 to read or write in any language) compared to 62% in Nigeria.
 Even though the countries have similar school life expectancy (9 years),
 the youth unemployment (between ages 15-24) is at a staggering 18.3% in
 Nigeria compared to 3.9% in Tanzania.
 The overall poverty also seems more widespread in Nigeria - with 40.1% below
 the poverty line (estimate) compared to 26.4% of the population living below
 the poverty line in Tanzania (2017 estimate).
 This is despite higher income inequality in Tanzania which has a Gini-coefficie
nt for household income of 40.5 (2017 estimate) compared to 35.1 for Nigeria
 (2018 estimate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A brief overview of the two economies using data from OECD (Organisation
 for Economic Cooperation and Development) suggests that of the two economies,
 a higher percent of the GDP comes from agricultural production in Tanzania.
 The per-capita GDP 2020 for Nigeria (2396.04 USD) is much higher than that
 of Tanzania (976.16 USD) (source World Bank).
 The GDP from manufacturing, mining and construction is nearly double for
 Nigeria (8749.61 million USD in 2022) compared to Tanzania (4221.41 million
 USD in 2021).
 Nigeria's GDP from agriculture is 9311.36 million USD and Tanzania's is
 4313.47 million USD.

The structural differences seem to be due to a higher reliance on energy
 exports for Nigeria - which, as of 2020, exports $35.9 billion crude-gas
 and imports $7.75 billion of refined Petroleum apart from cars ($3.03 billion)
 and wheat ($2 billion).
 On the other hand, Tanzania's major exports are Gold and other minerals
 ($3 billion) followed by agricultural products (0.594$ billion).
 The major imports of Tanzania are refined copper and petroleum ($2.2B).
 Among the two economies, Nigeria relies less on the agrarian exports and
 more on the energy-related infrastructure - likely accounting for higher
 average education levels in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the political systems in the two countries, Tanzania has shown a higher
 propensity to state control as nearly all land resources in Tanzania are
 government-owned.
 Tanzania is also more uniform ethnically - as about 95% of Tanzanian nationals
 identify as Bantu.
 On the other hand, the ethnic composition is more varied in Nigeria with
 Hausa (30%), Yoruba (15.5%) and Igbo (15.2%) as prominent ethnic groups.
 The policy of education has also seen different directions in the two economies.
 At a time when other countries in the region were expanding their education
 sector, the secondary education opportunities had faced some restrictions
 in Tanzania (

LatexCommand cite
key "soderbomReturnstoEducationTNZKYA2006,appletonKenyaeducationalExpansion1999,buchertEducTNZ1992"

 ).
 The private education seems to have flourished with relatively fewer limits
 in Nigeria.
 The effects of all of these factors towards education expense should become
 clearer in further subsections.

Considering the overall distribution of education expenses, we see that
 the urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in both the economies.
 The urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents in Nigeria
 whereas they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for tertiary education (rank 3) is almost
 double that of the expenditure on secondary education (rank 2) in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these expenditures rise by about 54%.
 The educational expenses do not seem to rise much with asset disparities
 in Nigeria - whereas they seem to be more unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure

Despite the uniformity in LSMS data fields corresponding to education expenses,
 the collection methodology may not be the same across all the countries.
 This is evident from the much lower educational expenses in Nigeria than
 in Tanzania (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Our comparison of the two economies (Tanzania and Nigeria) therefore does
 not rely on the measurement of educational expenses relative to one another.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Comparing education levels of the household heads, we see that the average-educ
ation rank of the household heads in Tanzania (1.8) is lower than that in
 Nigeria(1.9).
 We also see that the role of private education is much higher in Nigeria
 (see Figure

 The average number of children in households that are of an age appropriate

 either (see values for

 A clear difference between Tanzania and Nigeria - however - is that of
 standard-deviation in asset density (
\family typewriter
assetdensity
\family default
) - which is higher for Tanzania.
 Further, the predominance of agricultural occupations (see stdev values
 for 
\family typewriter

) is higher for Tanzania as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth pointing that barring such broad observations, the LSMS data
 used in our analyses may not permit a cross country comparison for education
 expenses in a much finer detail.
 One reason is simply that the distribution of savings, income and employment
 opportunities is disparate in the two economies.
 The other reason is that there is also a difference in sizes or granularity
 of district classifications in the two economies.
 More specifically, the sizes of districts in Tanzania seem much larger
 (particularly in the rural parts) than in Nigeria.
 This is why the per-district density of secondary education facilities
 - which we measure with the variable 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 - is reported lower in Nigeria (see values corresponding to 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) - while the education levels of the consumer populations remains higher
 in Nigeria (see highest_educ in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 The ruralness of districts - measured as number of wards declared as rural
 in a district (i.e.
 the variable 
\family typewriter
rural_wards
\family default
) - does not seem affected by this disparity in sizes as much (compare the
 values for 
\family typewriter
rural_wards
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Summary-Stats}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) - since a rural-urban classification that declares boundaries of a district
 based on areas surrounding an urban (or semi-urban) centre tends to bring
 a uniformity to the number of rural wards in a district.
 The current paper therefore focuses on implications for education expenses
 within the two economies rather than performing a cross-country comparison
 of education expenses.

That said, there is a noticeable disparity in distribution of assets (durable
 goods stocks) across the two countries that is evident from direct comparison
 of asset values.

 sparse in Tanzania even though the overall expenditure appears similarly
 distributed in the two countries.

 (Nigeria) are based on the standardisation of various occupations in Tanzania
 and Nigeria.
 Since the range of occupations in the surveys from Tanzania and Nigeria
 is varied, the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria
 have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey so that
 a higher occupation rank represents an occupation that provides higher
 income.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and the reporting
 of occupations in surveys from both the economies
\begin_inset Foot

It is not uncommon for the empirical studies in SSA to have the data on
 occupation or education proxy the income differences (Alesina et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem
 that may be further aggravated because of a large informal sectors in the
 economies.

 The mapping from specific occupations to the occupation-ranks for Tanzania

 A higher occupation rank represents occupations that bring higher income.
 As described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:Results"

, the key observation from the data is that the disparities in income and
 durable goods are more localised in Nigeria while they are more extreme
 across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

To reiterate, a significant number of household units in both the economies
 are made up of joint families where the reported educational expenses correspon

 The education level of the HH would thus point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and the previous generation for
 younger households where HH has young children.
 To resolve this disparity, we avoid using the education rank of the HH
 and instead use the highest education rank in the generation of the students'
 parents

 The tobit uses a lower limit of zero given a number of houses have no expenditu
re on education.
 A zero expenditure is reported for nearly 65% households in the survey
 from Nigeria (2015) and 43% households in the survey from Tanzania (2014).
 This suggests that either the education expenses are recorded in more detail
 in Tanzania or that a certain basic level of expenses is not considered
 in the survey for Nigeria.
 The particular disparity also limits our ability to compare educational
 expenses relative to one another for the two economies.

 This seems largely due to the educational expenses forming a higher proportion

 Thus while urbanisation must raise the prices of non-durable expenditure

 In other words, the expenditure on education is necessitated despite the

 This is an indication of the regional disparities in the economies.
 More particularly, the differences in density of assets indicate the level
 of urbanisation that have a strong effect on education expenses - despite
 controlling for the effect of availability of secondary-school education.
 While absence of educational facilities must clearly suppress education
 expenses in a region, the positive effect of assets-density after controlling
 for availability of education facilities also suggests relevance of certain
 environmental factors that contribute to education - such as a competition
 towards higher income social positions or presence of occupations requiring
 higher levels of education - factors with an important role after the availabil
ity of educational facilities has been considered.

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of household total expenditure are - however - relevant for
 private education - which is limited to the wealthier households in both

 While a higher proportion of young population seems to be in private schools
 in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It also seems that the consumers are more likely to spend on primary education
 in Tanzania - as the access to secondary and tertiary-education remains
 much lower (this is further elaborated in discussion below of the results

The results from the alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators
 suggest a particular limitation of the use of urban-rural indicators from
 the survey.
 More specifically, the coefficients of rural-wards

 However, the inference of a higher expenditure on education - when using
 urban-rural indicators - by the rural residents in Nigeria (see significance

 This is confirmed with the weaker role of wealth i.e.

 We also see that the educational expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 rises with the second explanatory variable i.e.
 the wealth concentration ( 
\family typewriter

 In the alternative formulation where urbanisation is measured with the
 ruralness score (

 The disparity in the role of

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing with the comparison of results with education-expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$

 as the dependent variable, we see that private-education indicator variable

ref{tabTNZNGR_r}

 The education expenses in Nigeria therefore depend less often on whether
 education is provided through private educational institutions or not.
 The results also indicate lower access to secondary and tertiary-education
 in Tanzania (see coefficients of secondary-school-age

 total assets-worth logarithm

 but is weaker for Nigeria where the enrollment into secondary and tertiary
 education is higher - regardless of the differences in long-term intergeneratio
nal wealth (measured with logarithm of assets-worth 
\family typewriter
ln_tot_assets

 The decomposed view of expenses on education in terms of secondary and
 primary education level further clarifies this observation - reflecting
 the far lower access to secondary education in Tanzania.

The role of the number of children (

\family default
) also seems stronger in Tanzania than in Nigeria - but the effect is likely
 due the education expenses primarily driven by the primary education levels
 in Tanzania (as well as a higher percentage of households reporting no
 education expenditure in the survey from Nigeria).
 Another consequence of most households spending on primary education alone
 is that the agrarian households appear as spending higher on education
 after considering the wealth-concentration among households with the same
 educational-status.
 The education expenditure is higher for agrarian households in Tanzania
 after taking into account their poor educational status (see coefficients

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wealth effects in Tanzania overall seem stronger, but they ought to
 be considered in light of the much lower expenditure on secondary (and
 higher) education and higher disparity in asset-ownership (even after taking

 The significance of logarithm of assets-worth (

 wealth and in urban areas (see significance of 
\family typewriter

and

 but a higher dependence on industrial output in Nigeria also seems to have
 contributed to a higher demand for secondary and tertiary education in
 the economy overall ( compare with significance of

 Another observation - the stronger role of father's education level in
 Tanzania - also seems related with these disparities in the two economies
 as well.
 A comparison of education expenditures across the two countries must take
 into account the different stages which the two countries appear to be
 in terms of urbanisation and economic development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the role of social environment is found significant in both the
 economies.
 The role of English language seems significant in Tanzania - where the
 English-speakers spend significantly higher on education (see coefficients

 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the educational expenses are higher among
 households identifying as Christian (see coefficients of

 In both cases, the role of social characteristics may be rather inseparable
 from differences in educational institutions.
 In case of Tanzania, the ability to speak English is aligned with attending
 educational institutions while in Nigeria, the role played by Christian
 missionaries in establishment of educational institutions may be reflected
 in the disparity of access to educational facilities.

While the role that the wealth-concentration

\family default
 plays towards access to education appears similar for the rich and poor
 halves in a locality as well, we do see a higher economic significance
 of wealth-concentration 
\family typewriter
assetdensity
\family default
 for the below-median-assets household in Nigeria - possibly because of
 high education costs in urban areas where asset-possession may be lower.
 The access to private education and to higher education favour the richer
 households in both economies - as the economic significance of private-educatio
n factor variable 
\family typewriter
educpriv 
\family default
is consistently higher for richer households as is the expenditure on tertiary
 level education in both the economies (considering the budget shares).
 The significance of social factors - on the other hand - remains unaffected
 by whether the consumers have above or below the median asset ownership
 level.
 More specifically, the factor variables for English-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english
\family default
 and (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
religion 
\family default
) are significant in results from Tanzania and Nigeria (respectively) for
 both richer and poorer households.
 The factor variable for English-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english

 is significant for consumers both above and below media asset possession

To ensure that the effect of assets remains strong after accounting for
 occupation or education level, we recompute the wealth concentration by
 considering only those in the household's vicinity with the same value
 of the indicator for primary/higher-than-primary education-level of the
 household-head and then again with the same value for the agrarian/non-agrarian
 occupation indicator.
 Three types of vicinities thus implied - are summarised in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{tab:ReferenceDefinitions}

\end_inset

.
 The first interpretation is one that we have already described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Discussion"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 - where a simple average of the total assets owned by the households in
 the consumer's district is used.
 Both education rank and an agrarian-occupation factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the household head's occupation is agrarian or not are
 used as controls in this interpretation of the vicinity.
 The second interpretation of the vicinity presented as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{educ}$
\end_inset

 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabTNZNGR_reduc}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is based on a supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the education level of the household-head is higher
 than primary school or not.
 More specifically, this second interpretation uses the prosperity within
 the educational levels implied by supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is also used as the additional control in this second interpretation.
 Finally, the third interpretation of vicinity is based on the average prosperit
y in the agrarian vs non-agrarian occupations (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

) and uses educational rank as the additional control variable.
 The results from this third interpretation of vicinity are presented in

 (respectively) for Tanzania and Nigeria, we see again that while the wealth
 concentration corresponds to a rise in educational expenditure logarithm
 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 for Nigeria, its effect is insignificant (whether one uses the wealth-concentra
tion in the supra-primary-educated neighbourhood 
\family typewriter
assetdensity_educ 
\family default
or wealth-concentration in the agrarian-neighbourhood 
\family typewriter
assetdensity_agri
\family default
 ) for Tanzania.
 Further, since the coefficients for secondary-age indicator 
\family typewriter
is_secondaryage
\family default
 seem higher for the agrarian/non-agrarian vicinity (i.e.
 the coefficient for wealth-concentration in 
\family typewriter
assetdensity_agri

) than for the supra-primary education vicinity ( i.e.

\family typewriter
 
\family default
wealth-concentration in 
\family typewriter

), it can be argued that education expenses are more often clustered by
 agrarian or non-agrarian occupations than by education levels the populations
 have attained.

The main goal of the paper was to compare the relative importance of secondary
 level education availability and wealth effects in the context of sub-Saharan
 African economies.
 We find overall that the availability of secondary education remains a
 strong factor if one considers the variation in urbanisation levels intepreted
 as wealth-concentration.

%[Main finding: Physical access is more important]
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the literature often notes a higher significance of wealth effects,
 the consideration of urbanisation suggests that role of physical access
 may continue to be important in economies with wide disparities in urbanisation
 levels.
 This is critical also also because the private educational institutions
 do not yet play a major role in the provision of education in the region.
 The role of social differences indicated by the significance of social
 characteristics in education expenses for both the economies - further
 emphasises the need to improve wider access to secondary education.
 These findings seem aligned with the wider observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who elaborate on the significant role of religious and colonial institutions
 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of urbanisation levels - whether interpreted as wealth concentration
 or as urban-rural indicators from the survey - cannot be understated in
 the context of education expenses in both the economies.
 Further, since the agrarian consumers also maintain a high budget share
 on education expenses (in Tanzania), one can argue that the educational
 expenses are likely to remain high as more of the population attains education
 and the regional prosperity rises.
 This seems aligned with the recent finding from a cohort-study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that the labour with skills added through education is less willing to
 stay in agricultural activities.
 The disparities in education that exist side-by-side with extreme differences
 in urbanisation could be an issue more challenging than wealth effects
 in some sub-Saharan African economies.

As wealth effects seem less extreme in the higher developed economy (i.e.
 Nigeria) than in the less developed economy (i.e.
 Tanzania), one could argue further that wealth effects may to become weaker
 with rise in urbanisation - an optimism that supports the view of conventional
 pathways to equity in both income and equality (

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the wealth effects do seem strong in both the economies, but
 the relevance of wealth-concentration in the population having higher education
 levels points to a promising albeit precarious direction where more urbanisatio
n could improve access to education and employment opportunities in the
 region while increasing expenses on education overall.
