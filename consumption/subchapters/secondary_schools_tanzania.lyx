\begin_layout Abstract
The economies in sub-Saharan Africa often exhibit significant wealth effects
 that limit education expenditure and wider access to education in the region.
 Examining the severity of wealth effects across differing levels of urbanisatio
n in Tanzania, we find that availability of secondary education continues
 to be of higher significance than wealth - particularly in semi-urban areas.
 Compared with countries with higher levels of urbanisation in sub-Saharan
 Africa, role of wealth effects may be weakening with rising urbanisation.

\end_inset

 The current paper re-examines the role of wealth effects on education in
 the region by using a spatial distribution of assets in in Tanzania - finding
 that the education expenses are limited more often by availability of education
 facilities than wealth differences.
 A comparison with other countries in the region also suggests that changes
 brought with urbanisation may act to reduce or worsen wealth effects on
 education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wealth effects on education - the extent to which the household wealth
 contributes to education expenses - are commonly observed through various
 mechanisms (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,IliePaulineWhobenefitsfromHE2018"

\end_inset

).
 Other than through costs at point of use, household wealth also influences
 access to education through information symmetries that favour job-searches
 and representation in local institutions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As higher intergenerational wealth also helps fund higher education levels,
 wealth inequalities tend to become educational inequalities by creating
 a poverty trap for the lower-income households (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"

\end_inset

) - a concern that has been important for policy in SSA (particularly due
 to a large informal sector where volatility in income deprioritises education
 - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011,MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

 But while the empirical literature often suggests a stronger role of wealth
 effects than physical access for education expenses in the literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"

), a survey of educational expenses across spatial distribution of assets
 shows that the availability of education facilities remains of strong significa
nce in Tanzania - particularly in its poorer or semi-urban regions.

Instead of using income-data, the empirical studies for education more often
 rely on the data on ownership of assets (

 The urbanisation levels - on the other hand - are interpreted as that of
 wealth-concentration in the immediate area surrounding the household.
 Using wealth-concentration measure as as urbanisation-level takes into
 consideration the

 Observed at the district-level and based only on the market value of assets
 held by households, the measure addresses concerns with spatial inferences

 signifies the goods that are owned by the household.
 These constitute items that are more often referred to as durable goods
 in the consumption literature from the developed economies.
 There seem at least two reasons why the developing economics literature
 more often refers to the durable household possessions as assets.
 First, the financial assets are far less relevant in the developing economies.
 Second, the durable goods such as bicycles or stoves - however insignificant
 - are far more significant as durable goods in the developing world.

As such, the urbanisation levels influence participation in education through
 several mechanisms.
 Setting aside the physical access to education i.e.
 the higher availability of education opportunities in urban areas (considered
 a separate control), the two fundamental mechanisms for urbanisation that
 the paper focuses on are the relative abundance of opportunities for higher
 income employment and the social environment in the urban areas.
 The better opportunities of employment and wealth overall make education
 more affordable so that the households in rural areas - where incomes are
 invariably lower and education somewhat of a luxury- end up underinvesting
 in education.
 The social environment of urban areas is also often different - leading
 to a stronger need for finding education-dependent employment in urban
 areas.
 Banking on the sociological literature emphasising the role of land ownership
 in SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShiptonGoheenLandAfrica1992,AbayYoungRuralEconomy2021,KoseGhebruLandEthiopia2018"

), the positive externalities from being in a rich locality are tracked
 using the measure relying on concentration of assets-ownership in the study.

\begin_layout Standard
The finding that wealth effects are more severe in less urbanised areas
 rests on the physical access to education - a control which directly influences
 education expenditure.
 Since secondary education has been the focus of development policy in recent
 decades (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FullerVocationalTraining1976,TilakEducationPoverty2002,TilakPostelemEducIndia2007,HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanInvestmentIndianEducUneconomic1980"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the study focuses particularly on the accessibility of secondary education
 in Tanzania.
 The physical access control often plays a critical role in determining
 whether a given amount of funds is more appropriately used to build accessible
 schools or to support and economise education instead.
 More specifically, if physical access for education is what prevents the
 attainment of education, then building more schools becomes of higher priority.
 On the other hand, if wealth effects are stronger in the economy, then
 affordability of education becomes an important issue - even if returns
 to education were a cause of concern.
 Whether returns to education are enough to increase education participation
 for lower-income households or not - also often hinges on there being less
 significant wealth effects and sufficient physical access to education
 in an economy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 The results we obtain with urbanisation levels seem significant as the
 wealth effects are more often reported to be stronger than the effects
 of physical access in empirical studies from the region (

 While early attempts to explain the role of social factors seem to have
 advanced the notion of social capital (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "BourdieuCulturalRepr2018"

 In the particular context of Tanzania, two factors seem of particular significa
nce.
 First is the parental educational level which indicates the acquisition
 of skills (from transferred from parents) that are valued in employment
 markets (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TanselParentEducEffects1997"

\end_inset

).
 Second is the main occupation in the household - which indicate agrarian
 or non-agrarian nature of the household occupation that may provide a non-trans
actional advantage through social networks.
 We also consider the ability to speak English as a separate control which
 could indicate an exposure to education in ways that the poorer or rural
 households may not be exposed to.

An essential claim of the human capital theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is that the educational investments must change over the life cycle of
 consumers.
 The age associated with children in the household are thus considered as
 a control in the study.
 In a setting where higher education is rare, the transition to secondary
 or tertiary education is an important concern and justifies the use of
 category variables indicating whether there are children of school-age
 in the household or not.
 Given that large households have higher basic needs than smaller households,
 the number of children are also considered a separate control in the study.

In summary, the household wealth and urbanisation levels are the main explanator

 access to education, the social or demographic factors and the household
 characteristics serve as important controls
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since urban households evidently have higher wealth, a comparison of urbanisatio
n and wealth effects is not without concerns of a correlation between household
 wealth and urbanisation.
 However, as the study is concerned only with the relative importance of
 urbanisation and permanent income measures in the two countries - rather
 than the elasticities of expenditure, these issues are less relevant to
 the comparison of household educational expenditure.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first explanatory variable i.e.
 the wealth or the permanent income of the household relies on standard
 consumption theory to use the logarithm of household's total annual expenditure
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 The urbanisation levels correspond to a wealth-concentration measure that
 is used as the second explanatory variable (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details) - and corresponds to the average asset-ownership levels in
 the households' vicinity.
 The physical access to education - is measured with the number of secondary
 schools in every district so that a higher score of 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 for a district implies more secondary schools in the district.
 Further robustness checks are conducted by redefining the wealth concentration
 measures which vary the boundaries of households vicinity and examine the
 significance of wealth-concentration in the household's neighborhood of
 similar occupations (agrarian/non-agrarian) and education ranks (primary,second
ary).
 In the alternative formulation - which we provide for a comparison with
 a more conventional approach using urban-rural demarcations from the survey
 - the total value of long-term assets owned by the household i.e.
 the measure of household wealth is used as the first explanatory variable
 and a

ruralness

 score based on urban-rural indicators from the survey is used as the second
 explanatory variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The varying levels of urbanisation allows us to explore the challenges that
 improvement of employment opportunities and economic development may bring
 towards access to education in the region.
 If wealth effects matter less in the urbanised areas (after controlling
 for physical access), then education policy may need to direct its attention
 to improving physical access.
 On other hand, if wealth effects are significant despite higher economic
 development in urbanised regions, then more attention is needed for improvement
 of access to education for lower-income households.
 The results from the paper indicate that the role of availability of education
 is more important than wealth effects in the semi-urban regions of Tanzania.
 They also suggest that despite the challenges of overpopulation and income
 inequalities, urbanisation may have a positive role overall so long as
 it raises employment opportunities and income (

While education may not be considered a basic necessity in all poverty-measureme

 poverty.
 Even in the developing economies, the poorest individuals tend to have
 a strong demand for education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002,GertlerGlewwe1990WTPEduc"

 The literature goes as far to suggest that when education is not state-funded
 in the developing economies, there might be a compulsion - rather than
 a mere willingness - to pay for education among the poor (

key "TilakEducationPoverty2002,TilakDeterminantsHouseholdexpenditureinRuralIndia2002"

 With a high demand for educated workforce in an industrialising economy,
 there seems little disagreement in policy therefore - whether from a human
 capital perspective (

An important consideration for education attainment in the population is
 that while higher education provides needed skills for higher incomes,
 the expenditure on education is often limited by the wealth one possesses.
 The differences in education elasticities based on income have in fact
 been emphasised in the literature early on since the mid-last century (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BensonEconomicsofPublicEduc1961,HashimotoHeathIncomeElasticityEduc1995"

 The empirical studies from the SSA also report significant wealth effects
 on education (

 Inspecting the enrollments data, for example,

 note that the children from households that have large cattle stocks face

\begin_layout Standard
While the wealth-effects remain significant in SSA, much of the discussion
 on the high graduate unemployment and low higher-education participation
 has focused on the poor returns to education in the region.
 On one hand, the literature attributes these problems to the prevalent
 mismanagement in public education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and on the other it highlights a misplaced focus on formal education in
 the informal economy settings (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Instead of focusing on the returns-to-education, we argue that the poor
 returns may not offer a complete view of lower participation in education.
 One reason is that the education needs or perceived value of education
 may not be adequately captured with a returns-to-education approach.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 point out, the returns-to-education approaches tend to ignore the positive
 externalities from education.
 The other reason is simply that the role of physical access and wealth
 may be far more dominant than the issue of poor returns-to-education in
 an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive externalities from education - which one may use to argue that
 the returns-to-education perspective is an incomplete one - are less of
 an issue in the context of SSA.
 Many empirical studies in fact have reported several instances of waste
 in rent-seeking activities after graduation in the SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oketchAfricaHE2016,MinnisNonformalEducation2006,dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While it is beyond doubt that returns-to-education are an important concern,
 they do need to be viewed in the context of wealth effects and availability
 of education facilities.
 It is possible for the demand for education to be suppressed due to inadequate
 income (relatively high prices of education) in the economy or a sparse
 distribution of education opportunities rather than due to lower pay from
 post-education employment opportunities alone (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, if education expenditures are better explained with physical
 access, then the policy may need to focus on building more accessible schools.
 On the other hand, if wealth-effects are more significant, then there is
 a need to make education more affordable for the lower-income households.
 The choice between the two is hardly one that is mutual exclusive - but
 merely indicates the relative significance of the options faced by policy.

While empirical studies have found more often that the physical access is
 less significant than the wealth effects (

 access do become stronger at higher (secondary and tertiary) levels of
 education (

 The effect of urban-rural differences - which may be correlated with difference
 in both physical access and wealth concentration - has also been widely
 reported to be significant in SSA (

 Both urbanisation-levels and wealth (aside from the physical access to
 education used as a control) - are thus important concerns in the study
 and that we examine to consider the relative importance of wealth effects
 with respect to physical access.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to interpret the effect of a standardised wealth-concentration-based
 measure of urban-rural differences is of contrasting local vs wider wealth
 disparities which prevent access to education.
 From this perspective, the wealth-concentration based analysis examines
 whether a wealthier locality has a stronger influence on education than
 household income (indicate by total expenditure) or not (see

 The dichotomy could also useful in explaining how the social environment
 of more urbanised areas could influence education expenses (e.g.
 by creating a more competitive setting for education).

The effects of social environment on education may have been only recently
 elaborated in the literature from SSA (

 post-war era (

 While this early research had viewed education as a certain high-culture
 participation which enhances the social capital of a household, the later
 refinements have focused more often on the specific role played by social
 networks and parental acquisitions or skills (

 in Netherlands.
 More importantly, as

 argue, it is possible to explain a significant part of parental social
 background with explicit measures of resources accessible to the students.
 In another study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 point out that higher educated parents invariably spend more time with
 children - a social factor that contributes to how parental education levels
 influence the next generation.
 In fact, the high-culture participation does not always influence educational
 performance positively either.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ByunTheseisCulturalCapitalSouthKorea2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 find, the high-culture participation affects educational performance negatively
 in South Korea as it takes time off from study.
 In most cases, the cultural factors thus seem to matter in education only
 through economic factors that are relevant for participation in education.
 Recent literature is thus more often concerned with a

 that of urbanisation, paternal characteristics (paternal education-level,
 occupation etc.) and other household factors (language spoken).

In summary, the literature observes several factors - such as the pro-rich
 nature of education, an insufficient focus on informal economy, mismanagement
 in public expenditure on education and poor returns after graduation -
 that may simultaneously contribute to lower education expenses and poorer
 participation in SSA.
 While wealth effects may be of overall concern, the availability of secondary
 education institutions in semi-urban and rural regions may be worth more
 attention in some economies.
 At last, it's worth remarking also that the economic context of SSA has
 certain implications for education expenses that are beyond the purview
 of an education policy.
 The high-land labour ratios (

The goal of our empirical analysis is to find out physical access is more
 than wealth effects on education expenses rather in an economy with varied
 levels of urbanisation.
 The paper relies primarily on a wealth-concentration measure of urbanisation
 levels - while providing results from a formulation based on urban-rural
 indicators for comparison.
 In the main formulation, the logarithm of total expenditure is used as
 the main explanatory variable while the wealth concentration measure -
 the second explanatory variable - is calculated as the average assets in
 the consumer's district (for smaller districts, the average over multiple
 districts within a 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 boundary is taken).
 In the alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators, the two explanator
y variables are the wealth based on durable goods from the survey and an
 ruralness score based on urban-rural indicators themselves.
 The measures for wealth-concentration (as well as the first explanatory
 variable in the alternative formulation) rely on the market-value of durable
 goods (including land, housing) that are reported in the survey (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 It is worth highlighting that the durable goods are considered as part
 of the consumer wealth only if they are transferable over generations.
 The ownership of goods that won't last more than a lifetime enter as consumptio
n for the household rather than as assets contributing to the intergenerational
 wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
In a simple econometric model
\bar default
, the representative household balances i) her non-durable consumption (excludin
g education) with ii) increasing expenditure on education for the children.
 The non-durable consumption that the household may spend on excludes the
 expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and non-durable consumption excluding assets-related-c
osts thus form the consumer budget in the model.
 In this model for cross-sectional comparison of education expenses, we
 do not consider the substitution with savings towards durable goods.
 Other than our focus on cross-sectional effects, another reason why we
 avoid panel methods in the current study is a severe measurement error
 with time-varying household asset values in the survey (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details of asset values recorded in the consumption microdata).
 More specifically, the variation in time of ownership of assets is not
 accurate enough for us to measure the changing value of household assets
 possessions - due to the inconsistent recalls of the number of assets over
 time for the same household.

It is worth highlighting that the econometric analysis is limited for households
 having one or more children.
 In other words, only households with at least one member with their age
 less than 18 are considered in the analysis.
 Since the households with lower working age are likely to have less accumulatio
ns as well as needs, the average paternal age in the household is also used
 as a control in the comparison.
 The number of children (household-size), the educational level of the parents,
 the accessibility of schools in the district and the language spoken are
 other important controls used in the analyses.
 For the paternal educational levels, we use an educational rank that is
 standardised by differentiating between primary, secondary and higher education
al levels (see Section

% To recap, the wealth-concentration interpretation of urbanisation - which
 interprets urbanisation as concentration of long-term asset ownership in
 a 6-km area is used while measuring wealth effects with household wealth
 - whereas the conventional urban-rural classification is used while measuring
 wealth-effects using assets-ownership.
 This 6-km scale in the district where the household residence is located
 - is based on the geographical distances between districts and the average
 distance to the education facility recorded in the consumption survey.The
 population density based approaches have been avoided due to issues arising
 of densely populated rural areas in SSA economies ([#hendersonurbanizationSAADi

 the World Bank.
 The survey is unique in its aims to improve the understanding of links

 and agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys from multiple countries is largely uniform in its
 data-model (fields) and is often geo-referenced with a sufficiently wide-covera
ge in the country to allow a study of spatial variation in the observed
 variables.
 The years used for the cross-section analyses are the most recent years

 (calculated as per the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited, we focus on durable goods that can be transferred over a generation.
 We therefore include items as long-term assets only if they are costlier
 than furniture - which is the cheapest asset to be transferred between
 the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$

\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 These costs are used both for the wealth-concentration measures and the

 total expenditure at the household level.

The geo-coding of districts is used for the averaging of assets at the consumer'

 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014, we do not use the rural field for analysis at the wider-dis
trict level aggregation and use a variable indicating how rural the consumer's
 vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards in the 6

 More specifically, a score 
\family typewriter

 for each district represents the number of wards that have a secondary

\end_inset

 area.
 A district with a higher score has more wards that have a secondary school
 in close vicinity (within 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 vicinity).
 This measure takes care of the issue that there are many wards (and enumerated-
areas within) having consumer entries for assets and consumption that the
 school-availability (primary as well as secondary ) is not recorded for.
 The aggregation over districts takes care of this issues there are no district
 with consumer entries for assets and consumption that we don't have the
 total number (score) of secondary-schools for.
 This score evidently also factors in the high-population density in urban
 areas since densely populated districts would have more wards within the
 same geographical distance as a less populated district.

 Whether an occupational sector is agriculture-related or not determined

 The number of children in the household, the ages of the children (and
 other members) are directly observed in the data.
 Since the typical household unit in Tanzania and Nigeria may not be a nuclear
 family, the paternal educational level - which is another important control
 in the study - cannot simply be the education level of the household head(HH).
 This is because unlike for nuclear families, the individuals on whom the
 household's reported  education expenses are spent, could be the grandchildren
 (rather than children) of the joint-family household-head.
 To avoid letting the household's paternal education level point to the
 generation before the parents of children for certain joint-family households
 - where the HH has his/her grandchildren attending school - while letting
 the same variable point to the parents of children in school for nuclear-famili

 To control for the price of consumption in the household's district, we
 also use the non-durable consumption averages 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 (excluding the costs associated with ownership of assets in the survey).
 The measurement 
\family typewriter
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default
 of price is akin to the price-deflator (unit-value) methods used in the
 demand literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The rationale for excluding costs associated with assets is that the costs
 of maintaining assets (fees, repair costs, usage costs etc.) are not levied
 on those who don't own the related assets and should not be included in
 the general price of non-durable consumption.

Tanzania lies in the east coast of Africa - spreading over nearly 885,800
 sq km of land of which nearly 43% is agricultural whereas of 37% of the
 land is forest land (a much higher proportion if compared to a more industriali
sed economy in sub-Saharan Africa such as that of Nigeria with nearly 78%
 agricultural land).
 The country's population was 59.7 million in 2020 (source: World Bank) the
 growth rate remains under 3%.
 While there are wide disparities in wealth and a relatively higher gini-coeffic
ient for household income (40.5 based on a 2017 estimate), the youth unemployment
 at 3.9% is relatively lower compared to other economies in the region.
 About 26.4% of the population is recorded to live below the poverty line
 (2017 estimate) in the country and only 36.7% of the population is considered
 urban.

Considering the overall distribution of education expenses, we see that
 the urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in Tanzania (2.8 times more).
 About 20% (25% in rural areas) of those with age between 6 and 18 have
 never attended school.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for tertiary education (rank 3) is almost
 double that of the expenditure on secondary education (rank 2) in Tanzania.
 The educational expenses seem to rather unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure

 are based on the standardisation of various occupations in Tanzania.
 Since the range of occupations in the survey is varied, the different occupatio
ns have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey so that
 a higher occupation rank represents an occupation that provides higher
 income.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and the reporting
 of occupations in surveys from both the economies

 occupation or education proxy the income differences (Alesina et al.

 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem

To reiterate, a significant number of household units in both the economies
 are made up of joint families where the reported educational expenses correspon

 The education level of the HH would thus point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and the previous generation for
 younger households where HH has young children.
 To resolve this disparity, we avoid using the education rank of the HH
 and instead use the highest education rank in the generation of the students'
 parents

 This is an indication of the regional disparities.
 More particularly, the differences in density of assets indicate the level
 of urbanisation that have a strong effect on education expenses - despite
 controlling for the effect of availability of secondary-school education.
 While absence of educational facilities must clearly suppress education
 expenses in a region, the positive effect of assets-density after controlling
 for availability of education facilities also suggests relevance of certain
 environmental factors that contribute to education - such as a competition
 towards higher income social positions or presence of occupations requiring
 higher levels of education - factors with an important role after the availabil

The role of the number of children (

 The agrarian households appear as spending higher on education after considerin

Finally, the role of social environment is found significant.
 The role of English language seems significant in Tanzania - where the
 English-speakers spend significantly higher on education (see coefficients

 That said, it needs to be clarified that the role of social characteristics
 may be rather inseparable from differences in educational institutions.
 The role of an English-speaking parent may only be a reflection of the
 disparity of access to educational facilities in the economy.

To confirm that the assets-ownership does influence the access to education,
 we inspect the role of assets in lower and higher sub-samples of the surveyed
 population.
 We thus re-estimate the results with wealth concentration

 i.e.
 assets-worth logarithm

 The results demonstrate how the education expenditures (coefficients for

The wealth-concentration

 halves in a locality.
 The access to private education and to higher education favour the richer
 households - as the economic significance of private-education factor variable

is consistently higher for richer households as is the expenditure

 The significance of social factors - on the other hand - remains unaffected
 by whether the consumers have above or below the median asset ownership
 level.
 More specifically, the factor variable for English-speaking ability

 is significant for both richer and poorer households.
 Similarly, the effect of secondary-schools

To ensure that the effect of assets remains strong after accounting for
 occupation or education level, we recompute the wealth concentration by
 considering only those in the household's vicinity with the same value
 of the indicator for primary/higher-than-primary education-level of the
 household-head and then again with the same value for the agrarian/non-agrarian
 occupation indicator.
 Three types of vicinities thus implied - are summarised in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

 The first interpretation is one that we have already described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 - where a simple average of the total assets owned by the households in
 the consumer's district is used.
 Both education rank and an agrarian-occupation factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the household head's occupation is agrarian or not are
 used as controls in this interpretation of the vicinity.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 is based on a supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the education level of the household-head is higher
 than primary school or not.
 More specifically, this second interpretation uses the prosperity within
 the educational levels implied by supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is also used as the additional control in this second interpretation.
 Finally, the third interpretation of vicinity is based on the average prosperit
y in the agrarian vs non-agrarian occupations (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

) and uses educational rank as the additional control variable.
 The results from this third interpretation of vicinity are presented in

\family typewriter

 Further, since the coefficients for secondary-age indicator

 seem higher for the agrarian/non-agrarian vicinity (i.e.
 the coefficient for wealth-concentration in

\family typewriter

 agrarian or non-agrarian occupations than by education levels the populations
 have attained.

The main goal of the paper was to compare the relative importance of secondary
 level education availability and wealth effects in the context of Tanzania.
 We find overall that the availability of secondary education remains a
 strong factor if one considers the variation in urbanisation levels intepreted
 as wealth-concentration.

%[Main finding: Physical access is more important]
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the literature often notes a higher significance of wealth effects,
 the consideration of urbanisation suggests that role of physical access
 may continue to be important in economies with wide disparities in urbanisation
 levels.
 This is critical also also because the private educational institutions
 do not yet play a major role in the provision of education in the region.
 The role of social differences indicated by the significance of social
 characteristics in education expenses for both the economies - further
 emphasises the need to improve wider access to secondary education.
 These findings seem aligned with the wider observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of urbanisation levels - whether interpreted as wealth concentration
 or as urban-rural indicators from the survey - cannot be understated in
 the context of education expenses in both the economies.
 Since the agrarian consumers also maintain a high budget share on education
 expenses (in Tanzania), one can argue that the educational expenses are
 likely to remain high as more of the population attains education and the
 regional prosperity rises.
 The crowding effects towards education are thus imminent - as reported
 by recent empirical studies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who argue that the labour with skills added through education is less willing
 to stay in agricultural activities).
 The disparities in education that exist side-by-side with extreme differences
 in urbanisation could be an issue more challenging than local wealth effects
 in many sub-Saharan African economies.
 There are reasons to think that wealth effects may become weaker with rise
 in urbanisation - an optimism based on conventional pathways to equity
 in both income and equality through urban development (

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the wealth effects does appear strong in the economy, but the
 secondary-school access still plays a major role in education expenses.
 The relevance of wealth-concentration in the population having higher education
 levels may in fact point to a promising albeit precarious direction where
 more urbanisation could improve access to education and employment opportunitie
s in the region while increasing expenses on education overall.
