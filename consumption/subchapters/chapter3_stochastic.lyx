A risk-perspective of status consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is developed by viewing all status-related
 consumption as perceived investments towards future mobility in consumer
 wealth.
 A framework where an economic value of status consumption is presented
 with model of anticipatory emotions as the basis for theory of utility
 under risk.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[RETRIAL 1] We view status consumption as consumption in excess of wealth-adjust
ed needs a risky investment towards the consumer’s perceived future.
 Using a utility under risk, we explore how varied risk-attitudes could
 result in long-term differences under rising and declining phases of economic
 growth.
 The role of taxation policies in status consumption as risky allocations
 is also discussed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The studies on conspicuous consumption have recently explored visible consumptio
n in the developing economies.
 As a specific instance of status consumption, visible consumption is assumed
 to occur through a certain type of (visible) goods that are futile for
 the consumer.
 The assumption permits the separability of demand for visible goods from
 non-visible goods in the empirically analyses - where the separation between
 visible and non-visible goods is arrived at with independent surveys.
 Instead of using an approach that relies on such a survey of visible items
 we review what status consumption would mean in the context of wealth differenc
es and social stratification - whose effects may not be captured by a simple
 selection of visible items in a developing economy.
 In thus restating status consumption, we bank upon the first explorations
 in status consumption where it has been identified as a way for the consumer
 to offset the existing wealth or income differences

\begin_layout Standard
[IT IS NOT PROSPECT THEORY BEING USED ] Instead of assuming that much of
 status consumption occurs through visible commodities (clothing, shoes,
 jewelry etc.), we use a framework of demand under risk - where an uncertainty
 is associated with the promotion of one's social rank.
 By elaborating a utility function comprising both of wealth differences
 and the risks associated with future wealth, we attempt to answer if a
 separating equilibrium can exist between two consumers with differing degrees
 of risk-aversion who are known to have a prospect theory (PT) behavior
 as they observe a common stochastic process with diminishing rewards for
 risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, we consider an environment where non-durable consumption
 is both an expense and a potential risky position for a future jump in
 social ranking.
 In such an environment, the end goal of the consumer would be to simply
 maximise her wealth under the observed risk.
 As an example, education is an expense where less expenditure is guaranteed
 to disadvantage the individual - both because of how her value in the employmen
t market and how it shuts (or creates) opportunities for future rises in
 her income.
 The utility for education to the consumer therefore comprises both as value
 in the market after a future education and the probability of achieving
 success.
 
\bar under
[REPHRASE] If we observe only such expenses 
\bar default
i.e.
 those which affect savings and increase the probability of wealth transition,
 then we can view status consumption as a risky investment in the framework.
 Viewing status consumption as risky lottery in a scheme where less-riskier
 choices such as education or residence, we incorporate the insights from
 PT in the formulation of status consumption as a risky choice in consumption
 
\bar under
[WHY DO WE NEED TO INCORPORATE PT]?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a simple model of choice under uncertainty that we use, income occurs
 only directly through increases in wealth.
 As reference points are key to a PT formulation, we consider a scenario
 where two consumers compete for wealth differences relative to a common
 reference point.
 The conditions for such a game to have a incentive for both the rational
 consumers (rich and poor) under PT - necessitate the diminishing returns
 from taking too much risk (and disadvantages from taking too little risk).
 The use of PT also allows us to incorporate loss-aversion in consumer choice.
 The solution of the model is used to argue whether the presence of of risk-shar
ing in growing economies that are segmented by social class could have implicati
ons for status consumption.
 We emphasise that the presence of risk-sharing across socio-economic classes
 could be as important as wealth differences - and that status consumption
 ought to be seen in the context of both.
 While the appeal for visible consumption is assumed to generally universal,
 we hope that such a framework would help us decisively explore factors
 that determine if the consumer populations in two disparate economies may
 engage in an entirely different pattern of status consumption.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods
 or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order
 to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

\begin_layout Standard
The advancements in game theory and statistics from the last century - particula
rly the theory of decision under risk - can explain some of the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour that Veblen had observed in the late
 19th century (see von Neumann-Morgenstern

 The effect that social conditions have on human behaviour is still an area
 of research (see Strauss
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a summary), but it is possible within the remit of the modern behavioural
 economics to view status consumption - i.e.
 the disproportionate spending on goods that only have a status (or visible)
 appeal - as an instance of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour.
 The two threads in the literature on status consumption which we have surveyed
 - first related to the behavioural approaches to life-cycle model and second
 related to the significance of social characteristics in visible consumption
 - could thus both be linked with such a formulation of status.
 We discuss the need for status for two competing consumers who observe
 an exogenous stochastic rate of growth.
 Using the intertemporal substitution framework, we then explore how loss-aversi
on and risk-seeking behaviours influence the consumers' balance between
 the non-durable and durable consumption.

 who seek a descriptive model for mental accounting (factors such as willpower)
 to explain observed trends in consumption.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice - where
 the consumer is subservient to her optimised plan for life-time savings
 and consumption - the representative consumer in a behavioural model is
 subject to overeating, overspending, accumulating items she doesn't need
 or acquiring habits she cannot afford (see Muellbauer

 If two consumers are to compete each other over assets, they subject themselves
 to anticipatory risk as well - theory that has been developed (see Loewesntein
 for a summary of anomalies and theories).

The second set of literature observes the demand on visible items across

 A key assumption made by such studies is that conspicuous consumption brings

 The argument - often attributed to Veblen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (additively) from the utility for non-visible consumption (we refer to
 this assumption as the futility assumption henceforth).

 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the

 In the presence of uncertainty with wealth, the consumer's place in the
 status order can be viewed as the long-term security of the consumer from
 extreme fluctuations in her (higher) wealth.
 This is the sense in which status is usually interpreted in the studies
 in health and sociological sciences - which often track status as a vector
 of income, education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 A demand equation for status goods that considers status as a mere demographic
 vector - however - ignores the dynamic nature of status and the demand
 for bandwagon items which also influence the consumer's perception of status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status, being a social psychological concern, is observed only at the level
 of a social unit (individual or a reference group).
 So while a researcher observing a population of consumers may interpret
 status as the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk associated with the transition
 to the highest band of net-worth in the long-term - the consumer necessarily
 has a subjective view of her status.
 This subjective view of status is influenced by local factors that may
 be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

averaged out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at higher levels - what status means at the consumer's level may in fact
 even disagree with what status means at a higher level view of a society.
 This is because the consumer's view of status would respond to the socio-politi
cal conditions that she perceives from within a particular social unit (family,
 community, ethnicity or region) than to the observed variables that are
 standardised over a larger area.
 The sense of status consumption is therefore necessarily localised at the
 consumer's social reference level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is only from a certain ontological point of view, that a high-status
 individual could be seen as someone who - in the long-term - has either
 or both of high income and a high (inter-generational) probability to move
 towards the high income group (stability).
 We may call this the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of wealth transition (one may consider a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{ij}\}$
\end_inset

 representing the transition from wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 - which the researcher observes).
 A low-status individual - similarly - is someone who has either or both
 of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 Concerned with the long-term effect of such factors to the asset ownership
 and stability of income, while a researcher could assume that all consumers
 observe the same probability of transition to higher state of income, the
 consumer at local levels would in fact be motivated by the particular short-ter
m concerns with respect to the social unit that shape her view of status
 of others and her own self-image.
 The uncertainty of wealth transition is observed at multiple levels in
 this subjective formulation of probability.
 The probability of material wealth transition that a consumer associates
 with the future is fundamentally subjective - even though it is determined
 in the long-term by the factors related to social or regional identity.
 For the purposes of this discussion, we consider this latter sense as the
 consumer's 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability of wealth transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the subjective uncertainty is a mere restatement of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in context of status and consumer decision.
 The consumer's assumed
\shape italic
 subjective 
\shape default
probability is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as her
 occupation, education, social or familial background, personality types
 etc.
 and is subject to change over her lifetime.
 As consumption is usually myopic, such a view would influence consumption
 at all times.
 This while the notion of status influences the risk-seeking behaviour of
 the consumer at local levels, the growth in the income and wealth of the
 consumer are constrained with long-term economic conditions (represented
 with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability).
 The long-term ownership of assets observed over time as the sense of consumer's
 wealth which reconciles the respective subjective probability functions
 of all the consumers.
 Such a reconciliation is possible only because in the long-term the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probabilities must converge.
 This is because the subjective behaviour of the consumer would be eventually
 revealed to the external worlds (other participants).
 This is similar to how the consumer choices are revealed in an anticipatory
 equilibrium (see Koszegi 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 and Leahy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CaplinLeahyAnticipatory2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the non-durable consumption of the consumers would be associated
 with their view in the short-term, what matters in the long-term is whether
 they have achieved a higher state of wealth (and thus status) or not.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider three consumers with different
 occupations in a small economy - an academic, a sportsperson and an investor
 - who all share the share the same reference point (by assumption) for
 wealth.
 They would all estimate the probability of doubling their wealth in the
 lifetime so that they may retire on the successful achievement of their
 goal.
 Given the nature of the profession, it is likely that the sportsperson
 overestimates the probability of her success until the middle of her career
 - after which the probability she associates to the success of doubling
 her wealth (if she hasn't already) would decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus a risk-seeking behaviour would be associated with a sportsperson much
 the way a risk-averse behaviour is associated with the academic who may
 be well aware of the limited probability of a windfall in the short-term.
 On the other hand, an investor may obtain a definite gain over a fixed
 term and have a risk-profile that lies somewhere in between that of the
 sportsperson and the academic.
 While the long-term decisions of the sportsperson may still be determined
 by the knowledge of expected income, a sportsperson would be characterised
 by a belief in an unlikely probability of success in the near-term in a
 way that is different from how an academic or an investor would foresee
 her future possible wealth transition.
 If we can assume that the three consumers have the same basic needs, it
 is unlikely that the consumption of the three individuals would be independent
 of how they view the transition probability of their monetary wealth in
 the near term.
 Still in the long-term it is only their success in monetary terms that
 would track their status (assuming that exceptional performance in every
 profession is satisfactorily rewarded in monetary terms).
 To state whether a risk-seeking consumer spends more or less on non-durable
 consumption we attempt to understand the consumer's goal in the intertemporal
 setting (where status consumption may appear to be less beneficial than
 saving for assets)(see Lowenstein for a discounting function
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

The fulfilment of basic consumer needs itself carries no influence on status.
 Thus if we were to compare the consumption of a risk-seeking consumers

This is further elaborated with aniticipatory emotions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-durable consumption serves two purposes - first it is tied with the
 level of consumer's needs - which in turn may depend on her wealth level.
 The part of non-durable consumption that is not associated the encapsulates
 a view of the future perception of her wealth.
 This allows us to view the consumer utility as a combination of - the latter
 being associate with the subjective probability.
 For example, those who hope to enhance their social network or get ahead
 of others through signaling are likely to believe in a higher likelihood
 of their promotion to a higher status.
 A higher probability for the state promotion perceived by a risk-seeking
 consumer would amount to a a higher (subjective) weight for the same observed
 probability.
 Similarly, the perceived (weighted) probability of loss of one's status
 would be higher (e.g.
 that of the threat of immigration to one's personal wealth) than the

# The subjective probabilities are not unrelated to the information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, it is worthwhile to speak of the economic processes that
 are implied by an interplay of the two levels of uncertainties that we
 use to relate risk-aversion with consumption.
 One way to view the two uncertainties is as a delay or barriers in the
 flow of information related to risks in the consumer markets.
 When it comes to risks to the future wealth, the firms and institutions
 are often better equipped and more responsive than the individuals or small
 communities.
 The differences in subjective uncertainties and observed uncertainties
 matter only because of the differences in how information is consumed at
 different levels of societal organisation (e.g.
 at the level of consumption and at the level where incomes are distributed).
 Such a presence of barriers to information also indicates a limit to the
 free-market assumption of an autonomous consumer fully capable of addressing
 her true needs (see a discussion in Hirsch

 sections of a society and their desire for mobility can drive the consumption

).
 But the implicit assumption in the free market view of an exchange between
 the rich and poor sections driving economic progress is that the consumer
 has full information of the risks and incentives related to her wealth
 (i.e.
 the economy functions in a way that these risks are known to the consumer).
 If barriers to the flow of information or the strength of institutions
 both undergo severe changes, this exchange may become less or more feasible
 (see Hirsch

) - a phenomenon likely to occur in the economies undergoing structural
 changes (such as rapid industrialisation, higher advertising effects or
 increased centralisation of markets).
 So long as one may admit that the information about socio-economic changes
 is consumed at different speeds and extent amongst the consumers than firms
 then it must follow that the two consider the information of risks differently.
 The consumption in the short-term would thus always be influenced by asymmetrie
s in the observation of risk i.e.
 a perceived uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the different levels of uncertainty to make any empirical sense, the
 subjective views of the consumer must be rationalised with the observed
 economic variables in the long run.
 This is achieved with the revelation of the consumer's subjective behaviour.
 As the resources in an economy evolve as they are influenced by the actions
 taken on beliefs rather than beliefs themselves, the consumer beliefs in
 the long-run, would reflect the changes in long-term assets by letting
 the risk-averse behaviours balance the risk-seeking behaviours participate
 in the same economy.
 Therefore we reconcile the consumers' subjective probability functions
 with an observed trajectory of wealth over a sufficiently long-period (
 this is implied with the properties of a probability weighting function
 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is illustrative for the purposes of this rationalisation of subjective
 probabilities to compare our approach with the permanent income hypothesis
 (PIH) in the intertemporal setting.
 Recall that the fundamental claim of PIH is that income has a transitory
 and a permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional
 to the permanent component
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancellation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 Unlike PIH however, we do not use the assumption of the independence (zero-corr
elation) between the transitory component and the permanent component -
 a condition far stronger than what is required to rationalise the subjective
 views.
 Instead of PIH's zero-correlation assumption, therefore, we have a reconciliati
on of the subjective probabilities with the observed probability in a stochastic
 process - which represents the evolution of wealth over time.
 Since there is little more than the net asset worth of the individual and
 the personal characteristics (such as social class) that are passed over
 as inheritance to the progeny, the observed probability is contributed
 to by only the assets transferred between generations in the long-run.
 On the other hand, the subjective probability of success through social
 interactions and the high quality consumption associated with it need not
 matter in the long-term - since the path to net asset worth may completely
 ignore the non-durable consumption habits of the past - except for what
 translates into the possession of long-term wealth
\bar under
.
 If we can assume a certain exogenous long-term wealth process therefore
 the subjective behaviour of the consumer could be tracked as expenditure
 above wealth-dependent needs.
 
\bar default
Unlike with a permanent income approach, therefore, the two uncertainties
 which we have outlined are not expected to be independent of each other
 but are reconciled by the transfer and ownership of long-term assets in
 the economy.
 The key difference in our approach - in comparison to PIH - is that we
 view risk not merely as dispersion in income amongst socio-economic classes
 (gauged with a simple variance in past income) but as part of more general
 dispersion in quality of consumption and wealth owing to social hierarchy
 in consumer choice.
 Consequently, we do not explicitly ignore the role of

 if the consumer is meant to always achieve the goal of improving her wealth

 If conspicuous consumption were truly futile, then there would be no way
 for the rational consumer to derive any utility from status-related consumption.
 The explicit subjective uncertainty - represented with a probability weighting

 allows the representative consumer to deviate from her long-term plans.

 Arguing that the consumer “invests” with status consumption towards a future
 wealth position, the problem of measuring status consumption becomes equivalent
 to understanding how the consumer's loss aversion for wealth and risk-seeking
 behaviour towards future gains could influence her investments towards
 future wealth.
 The consumer perception of risk and future wealth is thus formulated as
 a lottery scheme enumerating choices of chosen risk and value for the PT
 utility.
 The resulting formulation with utility under risk also allows us to endogenise
 the role of demographic characteristics which influence consumption through
 perception of risk (i.e.
 the weighted probability function).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This view of status consumption as simply excess non-durable consumption
 above needs may appear incongruous with how conspicuous consumption is
 seen in the public discourse i.e.
 as a phenomenon that only-serves-the-rich.
 A conspicuous item is commonly viewed as one that can be used both to distance
 oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those above oneself,
 but there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst the rich
 than its utility to the middle classes.
 If one could admit a definition of status consumption as a means to distinguish
 oneself from one's own reference group and agree that everyone does belong
 to a particular reference group, then it follows that everyone can benefit
 from status consumption (i.e.
 a probabilistic improvement of the consumer's perceived status can be achieved
 with status consumption).
 Further, if the long-term consumption is defined as assets that stay the
 same over many generations (so that all else is considered non-durable)
 then a focus on non-durable consumption sufficiently captures the sense
 of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of significant wealth differences, another reason to object
 to the view of status consumption as a consumption exclusive to the rich
 is that the utility to the rich from status consumption might be quite
 little given that the rich consumer already has enough to distance herself
 from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich ignores the advantage of status consumption to those who are neither
 extremely rich nor extremely poor.
 It may also rule out the conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't
 have anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to
 leave anyone behind).
 With a general view of conscpicuous consumption, one could argue that even
 the poorest may want to indicate that they are not the poorest - much the
 way richest may want it to be known to the others that they are indeed
 the richest

 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 may in fact be needed by both the rich and the poor.
 Further, everyone else in the middle (i.e.
 those who are neither the richest nor the poorest) must also try to avoid
 getting poorer and try to become the richest at all times.

By considering the asset hierarchies and the competition, we consider to
 varied opportunities between social groups.
 We believe that the differences in classes and occupations are not merely
 of wealth - but of future perceptions and realisations of wealth changes
 (i.e.
 both special and general probabilities).
 Karelis talks about this.
 There is another complication to the model that we consider.
 It is that the extreme differences are not sustainable if the consumers
 have to survive.
 This is because compassion and conflict also exist aside with competition.
 The qualities of compassion may co-exist with qualities of segregation
 - the rich and poor both may want an exchange where the rich can be compassiona
te and the poor needy but respectful and optimistic (see Karelis).
 The consumption itself has qualities of segregation in the sense that it
 creates needs that won't be fulfilled in the poorer group- so the segregation
 stabilises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JUST INTUITIVELY, we should also be clear about why risk-seeking and risk-averse
 equilibria develop and how low-alpha (overvalue low probability and undervalue
 high probability) - the poor risk-seeking class and vs high-alpha (overvalue
 high-probability - assuming it to be certain and undervaluing low-probability)
 - the rich class (not necessarily risk-averse).
 These are characteristics are more likely to depend on social factors other
 than the starting point of wealth differences - which matter less when
 the needs have been addressed (see other chapter where we discuss about
 extreme wealth differences).
 Risk preferences are more sticky (stable) and related to occupation and
 structures.
 See Shalev 2000 who show that pure-strategy Nash equilibria are always
 myopic loss-aversion equilibria.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, our approach to status consumption is similar in many ways to
 the one adopted in many recent studies on visible consumption - as it views
 a consumer's net utility from status consumption as a combination of private
 utility (subjective) and public utility (observed through rise in wealth).
 Where it differs fundamentally is in its treatment of uncertainty - establishin
g a relationship between the extreme wealth differences and the upside risk
 with consumption.
 Formulating status consumption as uncertainty associated with the future
 states of wealth and the utility from status consumption as a probabilistic
 private utility, we use prospect theory (PT) to understand a competition
 for status.
 A key difference from the approach taken in much of the literature on visible
 consumption is therefore that the status utility from such consumption
 is not futile in a material sense - a luxury watch may be futile for private
 use by itself (when compared to its cheaper alternatives that offer the
 same functionality i.e.
 that of telling the current time) but if an aspiring businessman uses his
 knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business, then
 the futile consumption may probabilistically translate into a material
 advantage.
 The promise of social mobility is indeed the core appeal of status consumption.
 Items like luxury watches are in fact important only because the rich flock
 around them 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indeed if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile - a non-materialist sense that our model is not concerned with.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We thus argue that the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may
 offer is important to the consumer as it acts as a means of connecting
 the rich with the not-so rich in the long-term.
 Further, the consumption of status item is driven by a small chance of
 success - a probability which the risk-seeking (risk-averse) consumer is
 likely to overestimate (underestimate).
 In the long-term one must reconcile the subjective probabilities with an
 observed wealth process - as only a few of the purchasers of luxury watches
 would improve their self-image and enhance their social networks to achieve
 material wealth - others would remain mere purchasers.

The intertemporal substitution problem for savings and consumption often
 rely on a discounting of the representative consumer's future wealth with
 rate for growth and depreciation wealth.
 Such approaches make limiting assumption the consumer behaviour -which
 we wish to understand in the context of status consumption.
 More particularly, the ideas of depreciation and growth-rates rely upon
 the ideas of consumer impatience and opportunities in nature that have
 been revised since the time they were first proposed (see Fisher

 A behavioural perspective towards the consumer's perception of risk allows
 us to explain the status needs of the consumer more appropriately than
 is possible with the discounting of certain and uncertain parts of consumption
 at different rates (see Cagetti
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 rates are associated education and other demographic variables).

We therefore view a status competition in a stochastic setting where the
 two assumed consumers may differ in their starting wealth and risk-aversion
 levels (see Shefrin-Thaler
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for a behavioural approach to the life-cycle approach).
 The subjective and observed uncertainties both determine the consumer's
 behaviour as the two consumers compete for relative advantage in wealth
 (assets) as they observer a discrete stochastic process of wealth.
 In this stochastic framework, status is constituted both a consumer's relative
 advantage in wealth as well as in her evaluation of risks associated with
 the future wealth.
 Such a formulation of status does not deviate much from the conventional
 view of status where it is viewed as the high net-worth of an individual
 as well as the the certainty of her wealth level.

 to a risky evolution of future wealth.
 Whatever isn't invested as

 We assume no natural depreciation of wealth in the model - so a reduction

 Contrasting this with the growth and depreciation approach, the wealthier
 of the two consumers in the model cannot silently earn interest on income
 - but must compete with the other consumer who could acquire new wealth
 by investing her 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$

 To further one's wealth, the richer consumer, in other words, has no choice

The first property of the discrete stochastic process for consumer wealth
 (which encapsulates the first uncertainty) is its detachment from consumer
 perceptions.
 Any externalities in wealth differences that are unrelated to the relative
 social positioning of the two consumers are represented in a wealth process
 that rewards risky investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 by either of the consumers (regardless of which of two consumer makes the
 effort or provides the investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 As the process does not favor the rich consumer's efforts to that of the
 poor, it is implied that the process must on an attribute that is independent
 of the characteristics of the consumer (i.e.
 a common resource or time rather than the income or wealth).

\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$

 dry up regardless of who puts up a higher effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 The uncertainty in the process implies however that the consumers don't
 know exactly when the opportunities would dry up.
 The consumer's choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 is therefore necessarily myopic with respect to the long-term changes in
 the wealth process - so that a consumer makes frequent decision on

 A steady state would be achieved just the same if the returns to risk rose

Notice that since the process for wealth is not subject to the competitions

 In the real world, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 may correspond situations where crowding effects create more opportunities
 for wealth or those where resources may be subject to an eventual depletion
 (e.g.
 land, forests, natural resources etc.).
 Thus though the consumers may be aware of being in a regime of rise or
 decline of returns to unit-effort with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

, they have neither control nor foresight of when the regimes could end
 or switch.
 To explain the mechanics of the wealth process, we consider an analogy
 of a two-consumer gold-rush economy where more digging efforts increase
 the chances of obtaining higher wealth for either of the consumer.
 The life-cycle effects are ignored by assuming that consumers are dynasties
 - so that the search for mining opportunities is the only way of finding
 new wealth for the foreseeable future in two-consumer economy.
 The luck does favour the hard-working in a gold-rush economy, so the process
 of wealth does not favour either consumer as it rewards anyone with effort
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 (which could decline or rise without the knowledge of the consumers).
 The randomness in the wealth process means that while the consumers are
 aware of the finiteness of gold deposits, they can only guess when the

 They are myopic in the sense that their efforts change often times before
 the goldmines would eventually deplete.
 No inherent depreciation for wealth means that an immense wealth could
 deplete quickly with a high rate of consumption (corresponding to costs

Status consumption is clearly of no value in this gold-rush economy where
 all wealth is tied to more mining.
 However, since superficial attachments are all what it takes to spur status
 competitions, one only needs the participants to attach a value to their
 beliefs of projected wealth for status to be relevant in the economy.
 Status consumption could thus serve a purpose in this model if the consumer's
 knowledge of each others' subjective evaluation of the future wealth isn't
 complete and is subject to change and influencing 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, if the wealth process (e.g.
 the set of gold mines in our analogy) was believed to be as fair as the
 flip of a coin, then there would be no inference of status and no investment
 towards achieving it.
 But if the perceptions arising out of wealth differences do not exhibit
 a fairness or symmetry of information among the consumers and the consumer
 is free to adjust her risk-attitude slightly, then a market for perceptions
 is unavoidable.

 Since a more risk-seeking individual becomes more successful in an environment
 of rising

 consumer (and vice versa i.e.
 consumers are set to be influenced by the more thrifty consumers in an

 in the final state of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 of the consumer.
 If a consumer is allowed to adjust her risk-aversion slightly in the subjective
 plan alone which is subject to her perceptions of the other consumer .
 Therefore even with an intrinsically fair wealth process, status consumption
 could offer a benefit as a slow shift towards a more favourable risk-aversion

Outside of the gold-rush analogy, the risk-aversion of the consumer is subject
 to the occupational and social structures in an economy much the way long-term

 As a market of experiences, status goods provide either an expectation
 of projected wealth or the knowledge of the expectation to the consumer
 - thereby either boosting her self-image or controlling her long-term risk-aver
sion.

 Taking a more concrete example of the stochastic setting for consumer expectati

 scales up the probability of income gain from the risky investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 so that an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is rewarded to the consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 .
 Here,
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$

 is a Bernoulli random trial observed in the economy and the diminishing
 returns for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$

 are only through combined 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}(t)+\psi_{2}(t)$

 Assuming a scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 which controls the size of payoff, the two consumers could be said to observe
 a common process of wealth:

The behaviour of the consumer could be studied by introducing more constraints

\end_inset

 so that they each have non-zero wealth until time-horizon

The introduction of credit for a consumer once her disposable income dries
 out is not different from starting with a different wealth.
 In other words, providing a credit line to a consumer amounts to starting
 the evolution of wealth with a different (lower or higher) initial income
 for the two consumers.

 Such a depletion of one's disposable income which risky investments are
 paid out from would be further exacerbated if we introduce an asset costs
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to the costs which the owned assets bear in the real-world).
 In fact the wealth is guaranteed to decline to zero eventually if there
 is no return from the investment

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$

 The cost function

\end_inset

 also implies that no one forgoes their needs to take risk since the needs
 of the consumer are meant to grow as her wealth levels rise (due to costs
 of labour, upkeep and maintenance etc.)
\end_layout

 Exhaustion of disposable income could also justify a redistribution from
 the richer consumers that would ensue in an extremely unequal setting (i.e.
 if difference in values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$

 is too much).
 Such a redistribution would influence both the equilibrium conditions and
 the expectations of future-risk aversion.
 Considering both asset costs

\begin_inset Formula $\delta$

Utility Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have noted before, our interpretation of status is not fundamentally
 different from its conventional view as a combination of (high) net-worth
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and a high likelihood of staying rich in the long-term.
 The model thus interprets status in a stochastic setting where both risk
 and value bring utility to the participating consumers.
 It is also implied that both reference-point for wealth and a loss-aversion
 to it matter to the consumer's view of relative wealth and status.
 A utility function in the model does not depend on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A(t)$
\end_inset

 but also the investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

 which the consumer sets in response to perception of future risk with projected
 value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 The approaches where only value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 or utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{t+1})$
\end_inset

 is optimised by the consumer are thus rejected in favour of an approach
 where both probability of a certain wealth level and the wealth level itself
 are considered
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To see the limitations of such an approach, consider where 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{t+1})$
\end_inset

 under a few risk-aversion parameters (see Sharpe 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for example).
 Here, a risk neutral consumer is one chooses a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{CE}$
\end_inset

 with uncertainty imposed by 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t\in[1,T]}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{CE}))=u(A_{CE})$
\end_inset

 The consumer who chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E($
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T}))>E(u(A_{CE}))$
\end_inset

 is considered risk-seeking and the consumer who selects 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))<E(u(A_{CE}))$
\end_inset

 would be considered risk-averse.
 With a CRRA utility for example, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\frac{A^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 leading to 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T})$

 being maximised when 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A_{T})$

 The measure of risk-aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 function.
 What this means in the stochastic setting is that if every consumer optimises

 then consumer has no reason to deviate from the maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A_{T})$

In summary, a success (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}=1)$
\end_inset

 at the draw 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would enhance a consumer's wealth whereas a failure (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}=0$
\end_inset

) would reduce her wealth by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

 (which she plans before the draw).
 With a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, the consumer would thus choose the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{*}$
\end_inset

 over the time period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(\psi(t)))$
\end_inset

 is maximised.
 Equivalently if 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tau$
\end_inset

 steps until 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 are considered in evaluating the expectation, then the consumer optimises
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{t}u(\psi(\tau))d\tau$
\end_inset

 It is evident that the risk-seeking individual (the low-

 i.e.
 thinks she is lucky in unlikely situations but underweights large

 higher than that chosen by a risk-averse individual (the high-

Dynamic Reference Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the dynamics of the model, a wealthy risk-seeker would be in a better
 off in an environment where probabilities of success rise whereas in an
 environment of declining rates of success, the richer risk-averse consumer
 would become richer (and poorer risk-seeker poorer).
 If the value of risk-aversion (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

) were held constant by both the consumer, then her evaluations of the future
 wealth would be driven only by her own (static) risk-aversion.
 Additionally, if wealth reference were merely a function of current wealth,
 the dynamics in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AsseEvolution_brief"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:utility_final"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 would imply an equilibrium where the consumers are better or worse off
 depending on their risk-aversion levels (which control effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 However, as the recent developments in models for anticipatory emotions
 have argued, real-world consumers are likely to be unsure about their reference
 points.
 If we relieve the static 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 assumption and assume that the consumer could be unsure about her own 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 while evaluating her future wealth (and that of the other consumer), the
 expectation of utility in Equation
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:utility_final"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 would need be evaluated over the variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer does not change 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 as frequently as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 in this setting since reference points for a consumer choice are not set
 simultaneously with the choice itself (see Koszegi 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoszegiAnticipationPersonalEqlb2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for theoretical underpinning of the model).
 With the dynamic reference point, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,r$
\end_inset

 are selected over a longer-term 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 than the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 over which the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is made.
 If the consumer can adjust her risk-aversion levels (e.g.
 occupational choices or long-term choices such as education that influence
 the consumer's long-term reference levels), albeit not as frequently as
 investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, then the consumer would optimise utility by selecting appropriate reference
 levels as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subjective plane of the optimisation is where status consumption becomes
 relevant in our model.
 While the consumers are uncertain of each other's response to the respective
 changes in wealth, a market for status goods serves as a market of experiences
 that may connect the consumers of varied risk and wealth configurations.
 In the real world, status goods are used both to distill away those with
 less wealth-retaining abilities and to attract those with wealth-gaining
 attitudes.
 Through acquiring habits, taste and identity that develop around status
 items, the consumer obtains a subjective security (or a boost in self-image)
 that makes her believe that she would not drift into an unfavourable risk-avers
ion level (habit).
 The longer-term choice for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(T)$
\end_inset

 is different from immediate risk-taking she must enact through selection
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

 and the slower habit acquisition allows the risk-averse (risk-seeking)
 consumer 
\bar under
to make other more risk-averse (risk-seeking) through consumptio
\bar default
n.
 In other words, by investing in status items, a risk-averse loser buys
 a protection against 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 going too far up (by engaging in bandwagon consumption for example) and
 the risk-seeking loser protects against lowering her 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 too much (by choosing a snob type consumption).
 Status consumption is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

influence good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the model that offers a perceived security which is not provided by
 the natural process.
 Another way to look at the above setting is as a zero-sum game where the
 consumers are uncertain about each other's future risk-levels and are thus
 willing to pay a price for the knowledge that the other individual would
 always have a favourable risk-aversion (higher or lower) with respect to
 oneself.
 Status consumption is constituted in how the two consumer exchange the
 information about their-risk aversion levels with each other.

The other option is to consider a two-dimensional reference point vector
 which consists of the wealth-reference and the reference 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 (security of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 of the other consumer).
 This too could be extended to make the same argument about the relevance
 of status and security.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:utility_final"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the consumer uses the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota(\Delta A_{T},\alpha_{T})$
\end_inset

 which adjusts 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 relevant at a time point 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to the consumer in every evaluation of future wealth at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{T}$
\end_inset

 - the value of reference-point chosen at start of every 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-period and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{T}$
\end_inset

 - the differences in wealth of the consumer at the start of the 
\begin_inset Formula $t-$
\end_inset

period.
 Notice that due to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{T}$
\end_inset

 depending only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{T}$
\end_inset

, the richer consumer directly influences the poorer consumers by raising
 their mid-point reference point (i.e making the poorer consumer more risk-taking
 than she would otherwise be).
 The consumer thus optimises the expected PT utility by by considering 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{T}$
\end_inset

 for time period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as the following double stochastic integral:
\end_layout

In the gold-rush analogy, status consumption is the value of a signal that
 indicates a higher subjective likelihood of finding gold in the future,
 status consumption also provides the security of a shared belief among
 the risk-sharing consumers.
 A consumer who can let both herself and the other consumer believe that
 she is poised to find the next big mine with much higher wealth levels
 than their current fortunes would carry a higher status (regardless of
 whether she is the richer consumer or not).
 Similarly, a consumer may lose her status not simply due to direct wealth
 loss but through a disbelief in her future prospects as well.
 By ensuring that the consumers keep their risk-aversion levels close to
 each other, they attempt to ensure that their fortunes don't diverge too
 much relative to each other.
 Thus even though a signal of projected wealth may have no value by itself
 (it always requires labor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 to retrieve more gold), it carries a value to the consumer since it shifts
 one's risk-aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{T}$
\end_inset

 in the desired direction.
 We thus associate a cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(L)$
\end_inset

 with status consumption for a certain bound 
\begin_inset Formula $(L)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $|\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}|<L$
\end_inset

.
 By paying a cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(L)$
\end_inset

, therefore, the consumer guarantees that the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $|\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}|$
\end_inset

 would not become higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

The monetary value for status consumption in the framework is simply the

 in the absence of knowing the other consumer risk-aversion.

\begin_layout Standard
The above dynamics imply necessarily that the asset differences would be
 much higher than their starting point if a risk-taking consumer gets richer
 and the opportunities to gain mobility (return from the wealth process)
 dry up – thus leaving no chance for the poorer consumer to participate
 in the wealth game.
 To reduce final wealth differences and to leave the game in a state ripe
 enough until a natural process reinvigorates with more wealth, a taxation
 policy could provide an additional control to the wealth differences in
 the game.
 A taxation policy can be seen as simply a means to transfer a (linear)
 proportion of wealth differences from the richer consumer to the poor consumer.
 The tax rates remain constant throughout and their effect on the future
 income are known to the consumer.
 In the presence of risk-aversion, the above model for status consumption
 also helps us understand how taxation could influence consumer preferences
 among consumers with varying wealth levels and risk-aversion (in a rising
 and declining economy).
 The complexity of the model can be addressed with Monte Carlo simulations
 so that the stability condition is merely the point at which the consumers
 have run out of risk-taking opportunities (i.e.
 their disposable income have neared zero or costs balance the future expectatio
n of wealth changes).

[Takeaways] 
\bar default
Instead of assuming wealth-differences we also focus on how the relevance
 of the knowledge of future across social sections could influence consumption
 more than the asset difference and income.
 This offers three advantages that are of value towards the normative theory
 for status consumption.
 First, we wish to arrive at a fair value of status consumption.
 Not all status consumption is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

waste
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but is necessitated by asymmetries in future hopes not fully due to asset
 differences but probably socio-political changes that create different
 perceptions of the future.
 This allows us to under status consumption and its proposed futility in
 a wider contexts or in disparate economies (say in the developing and the
 developed world).
 Secondly, we get a more quantitative view of the effect of taxation on
 status consumption - by related it to the certainty of future wealth and
 behavioural approaches to risk.
 
\bar under
Taxation is straight money - but status consumption is risky consumption.
\bar default
Thirdly, this framework also allows an explicit way of endogenising social
 privileges in status by explaining the material impact merely subjective
 pecking orders.

Conclusions

\begin_layout Standard
[Main Conclusion] The model attempts to find the conditions in an environment
 of uncertainty that justifies status consumption ...
 .
 The model interprets the relevance of local reference points as the personal
 equilibirum of consumers.
 This takes an approach that is more general and of more descriptive relevance
 than many of the models we've explored.
 As the roots of subjective inference lie in exchangeability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RichardSubjectiveProbRealThing2004,deFinettiLaPrevision1937"
literal "false"

\end_inset

., we wish to use a model that highlights how subjective interpretation could
 relate to hierarchy and still carry an economic impact.
 As the roots of uncertainty lie in exchangeability, the very presence of
 social hierarchy can be interpreted as individuals associating a higher
 subjective probability with a certain characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - by considering individuals with the same characteristics 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exchangeable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a private sense.
 It can be argued that wealth in the economy is important not only because
 of the purchasing power but fundamentally due to the social order in the
 form of an expectation held by other participants in the economy that they
 can replicate the success of the wealthy by acting as participants in the
 economy.
 Such subjective preferences there are hardly anomalies but reflect a long-term
 security perceived by individuals that they associate with certain social
 characteristics.
 The

 significance of such preferences is an empirical concern.
