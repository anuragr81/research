A risk-perspective of status consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is developed by viewing all status-related
 consumption as perceived investments towards future mobility in consumer
 wealth.
 A prospect theory utility is used for the consumer wealth and the uncertainty
 (perceived risk) of future wealth to describe risk-sharing equilibria in
 consumers with differing degrees of risk-aversion and long-term wealth.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[RETRIAL 1] We view status consumption as consumption in excess of wealth-adjust
ed needs a risky investment towards the consumer’s perceived future.
 Using a utility under risk, we explore how varied risk-attitudes could
 result in long-term differences under rising and declining phases of economic
 growth.
 The role of taxation policies in status consumption as risky allocations
 is also discussed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The studies on conspicuous consumption have recently explored visible consumptio
n in the developing economies.
 As a specific instance of status consumption, visible consumption is assumed
 to occur through a certain type of (visible) goods that are futile for
 the consumer.
 The assumption permits the separability of demand for visible goods from
 non-visible goods in the empirically analyses - where the separation between
 visible and non-visible goods is arrived at with independent surveys.
 Instead of using an approach that relies on such a survey of visible items
 we review what status consumption would mean in the context of wealth differenc
es and social stratification - whose effects may not be captured by a simple
 selection of visible items in a developing economy.
 In thus restating status consumption, we bank upon the first explorations
 in status consumption where it has been identified as a way for the consumer
 to offset the existing wealth or income differences

\begin_layout Standard
[IT IS NOT PROSPECT THEORY BEING USED ] Instead of assuming that much of
 status consumption occurs through visible commodities (clothing, shoes,
 jewelry etc.), we use a framework of demand under risk - where an uncertainty
 is associated with the promotion of one's social rank.
 By elaborating a utility function comprising both of wealth differences
 and the risks associated with future wealth, we attempt to answer if a
 separating equilibrium can exist between two consumers with differing degrees
 of risk-aversion who are known to have a prospect theory (PT) behavior
 as they observe a common stochastic process with diminishing rewards for
 risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, we consider an environment where non-durable consumption
 is both an expense and a potential risky position for a future jump in
 social ranking.
 In such an environment, the end goal of the consumer would be to simply
 maximise her wealth under the observed risk.
 As an example, education is an expense where less expenditure is guaranteed
 to disadvantage the individual - both because of how her value in the employmen
t market and how it shuts (or creates) opportunities for future rises in
 her income.
 The utility for education to the consumer therefore comprises both as value
 in the market after a future education and the probability of achieving
 success.
 
\bar under
[REPHRASE] If we observe only such expenses 
\bar default
i.e.
 those which affect savings and increase the probability of wealth transition,
 then we can view status consumption as a risky investment in the framework.
 Viewing status consumption as risky lottery in a scheme where less-riskier
 choices such as education or residence, we incorporate the insights from
 PT in the formulation of status consumption as a risky choice in consumption
 
\bar under
[WHY DO WE NEED TO INCORPORATE PT]?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a simple model of choice under uncertainty that we use, income occurs
 only directly through increases in wealth.
 As reference points are key to a PT formulation, we consider a scenario
 where two consumers compete for wealth differences relative to a common
 reference point.
 The conditions for such a game to have a incentive for both the rational
 consumers (rich and poor) under PT - necessitate the diminishing returns
 from taking too much risk (and disadvantages from taking too little risk).
 The use of PT also allows us to incorporate loss-aversion in consumer choice.
 The solution of the model is used to argue whether the presence of of risk-shar
ing in growing economies that are segmented by social class could have implicati
ons for status consumption.
 We emphasise that the presence of risk-sharing across socio-economic classes
 could be as important as wealth differences - and that status consumption
 ought to be seen in the context of both.
 While the appeal for visible consumption is assumed to generally universal,
 we hope that such a framework would help us decisively explore factors
 that determine if the consumer populations in two disparate economies may
 engage in an entirely different pattern of status consumption.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods
 or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order
 to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

\begin_layout Standard
The advancements in game theory and statistics from the last century - particula
rly the theory of decision under risk - can explain some of the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour that Veblen had observed in the late
 19th century (see von Neumann-Morgenstern

 The effect that social conditions have on human behaviour is still an area
 of research (see Strauss
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"

\end_inset

 for a summary), but it is possible within the remit of the modern behavioural
 economics to view status consumption - i.e.
 the disproportionate spending on goods that only have a status (or visible)
 appeal - as an instance of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour.
 The two threads in the literature on status consumption which we have surveyed
 - first related to the behavioural approaches to life-cycle model and second
 related to the significance of social characteristics in visible consumption
 - could thus both be linked with such a formulation of status.
 We discuss the need for status for two competing consumers who observe
 an exogenous stochastic rate of growth.
 Using the intertemporal substitution framework, we then explore how loss-aversi
on and risk-seeking behaviours influence the consumers' balance between
 the non-durable and durable consumption.

 who seek a descriptive model for mental accounting (factors such as willpower)
 to explain observed trends in consumption.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice - where
 the consumer is subservient to her optimised plan for life-time savings
 and consumption - the representative consumer in a behavioural model is
 subject to overeating, overspending, accumulating items she doesn't need
 or acquiring habits she cannot afford (see Muellbauer

 If two consumers are to compete each other over assets, they subject themselves
 to anticipatory risk as well - theory that has been developed (see Loewesntein

 The argument - often attributed to Veblen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (additively) from the utility for non-visible consumption (we refer to
 this assumption as the futility assumption henceforth).

 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the

 In the presence of uncertainty with wealth, the consumer's place in the
 status order can be viewed as the long-term security of the consumer from
 extreme fluctuations in her (higher) wealth.
 This is the sense in which status is usually interpreted in the studies
 in health and sociological sciences - which often track status as a vector
 of income, education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 A demand equation for status goods that considers status as a mere demographic
 vector - however - ignores the dynamic nature of status and the demand
 for bandwagon items which also influence the consumer's perception of status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status, being a social psychological concern, is observed only at the level
 of a social unit (individual or a reference group).
 So while a researcher observing a population of consumers may interpret
 status as the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk associated with the transition
 to the highest band of net-worth in the long-term - the consumer necessarily
 has a subjective view of her status.
 This subjective view of status is influenced by local factors that may
 be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

averaged out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at higher levels - what status means at the consumer's level may in fact
 even disagree with what status means at a higher level view of a society.
 This is because the consumer's view of status would respond to the socio-politi
cal conditions that she perceives from within a particular social unit (family,
 community, ethnicity or region) than to the observed variables that are
 standardised over a larger area.
 The sense of status consumption is therefore necessarily localised at the
 consumer's social reference level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is only from a certain ontological point of view, that a high-status
 individual could be seen as someone who - in the long-term - has either
 or both of high income and a high (inter-generational) probability to move
 towards the high income group (stability).
 We may call this the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of wealth transition (one may consider a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{ij}\}$
\end_inset

 representing the transition from wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 - which the researcher observes).
 A low-status individual - similarly - is someone who has either or both
 of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 Concerned with the long-term effect of such factors to the asset ownership
 and stability of income, while a researcher could assume that all consumers
 observe the same probability of transition to higher state of income, the
 consumer at local levels would in fact be motivated by the particular short-ter
m concerns with respect to the social unit that shape her view of status
 of others and her own self-image.
 The uncertainty of wealth transition is observed at multiple levels in
 this subjective formulation of probability.
 The probability of material wealth transition that a consumer associates
 with the future is fundamentally subjective - even though it is determined
 in the long-term by the factors related to social or regional identity.
 For the purposes of this discussion, we consider this latter sense as the
 consumer's 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability of wealth transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the subjective uncertainty is a mere restatement of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 in context of status and consumer decision.
 The consumer's assumed
\shape italic
 subjective 
\shape default
probability is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as her
 occupation, education, social or familial background, personality types
 etc.
 and is subject to change over her lifetime.
 As consumption is usually myopic, such a view would influence consumption
 at all times.
 This while the notion of status influences the risk-seeking behaviour of
 the consumer at local levels, the growth in the income and wealth of the
 consumer are constrained with long-term economic conditions (represented
 with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability).
 The long-term ownership of assets observed over time as the sense of consumer's
 wealth which reconciles the respective subjective probability functions
 of all the consumers.
 Such a reconciliation is possible only because in the long-term the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probabilities must converge.
 This is because the subjective behaviour of the consumer would be eventually
 revealed to the external worlds (other participants).
 This is similar to how the consumer choices are revealed in an anticipatory
 equilibrium (see Koszegi 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 and Leahy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CaplinLeahyAnticipatory2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the non-durable consumption of the consumers would be associated
 with their view in the short-term, what matters in the long-term is whether
 they have achieved a higher state of wealth (and thus status) or not.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider three consumers with different
 occupations in a small economy - an academic, a sportsperson and an investor
 - who all share the share the same reference point (by assumption) for
 wealth.
 They would all estimate the probability of doubling their wealth in the
 lifetime so that they may retire on the successful achievement of their
 goal.
 Given the nature of the profession, it is likely that the sportsperson
 overestimates the probability of her success until the middle of her career
 - after which the probability she associates to the success of doubling
 her wealth (if she hasn't already) would decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus a risk-seeking behaviour would be associated with a sportsperson much
 the way a risk-averse behaviour is associated with the academic who may
 be well aware of the limited probability of a windfall in the short-term.
 On the other hand, an investor may obtain a definite gain over a fixed
 term and have a risk-profile that lies somewhere in between that of the
 sportsperson and the academic.
 While the long-term decisions of the sportsperson may still be determined
 by the knowledge of expected income, a sportsperson would be characterised
 by a belief in an unlikely probability of success in the near-term in a
 way that is different from how an academic or an investor would foresee
 her future possible wealth transition.
 If we can assume that the three consumers have the same basic needs, it
 is unlikely that the consumption of the three individuals would be independent
 of how they view the transition probability of their monetary wealth in
 the near term.
 Still in the long-term it is only their success in monetary terms that
 would track their status (assuming that exceptional performance in every
 profession is satisfactorily rewarded in monetary terms).
 To state whether a risk-seeking consumer spends more or less on non-durable
 consumption we attempt to understand the consumer's goal in the intertemporal
 setting (where status consumption may appear to be less beneficial than
 saving for assets)(see Lowenstein for a discounting function
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 If the long-term assets can be considered as part of the wealth that can

 are influenced by the acquired wealth) are sensitive to the degree of risk-aver

The fulfilment of basic consumer needs itself carries no influence on status.
 Thus if we were to compare the consumption of a risk-seeking consumers

This is further elaborated with aniticipatory emotions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-durable consumption serves two purposes - first it is tied with the
 level of consumer's needs - which in turn may depend on her wealth level.
 The part of non-durable consumption that is not associated the encapsulates
 a view of the future perception of her wealth.
 This allows us to view the consumer utility as a combination of - the latter
 being associate with the subjective probability.
 For example, those who hope to enhance their social network or get ahead
 of others through signaling are likely to believe in a higher likelihood
 of their promotion to a higher status.
 A higher probability for the state promotion perceived by a risk-seeking
 consumer would amount to a a higher (subjective) weight for the same observed
 probability.
 Similarly, the perceived (weighted) probability of loss of one's status
 would be higher (e.g.
 that of the threat of immigration to one's personal wealth) than the

# The subjective probabilities are not unrelated to the information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, it is worthwhile to speak of the economic processes that
 are implied by an interplay of the two levels of uncertainties that we
 use to relate risk-aversion with consumption.
 One way to view the two uncertainties is as a delay or barriers in the
 flow of information related to risks in the consumer markets.
 When it comes to risks to the future wealth, the firms and institutions
 are often better equipped and more responsive than the individuals or small
 communities.
 The differences in subjective uncertainties and observed uncertainties
 matter only because of the differences in how information is consumed at
 different levels of societal organisation (e.g.
 at the level of consumption and at the level where incomes are distributed).
 Such a presence of barriers to information also indicates a limit to the
 free-market assumption of an autonomous consumer fully capable of addressing
 her true needs (see a discussion in Hirsch

 sections of a society and their desire for mobility can drive the consumption

 But the implicit assumption in the free market view of an exchange between
 the rich and poor sections driving economic progress is that the consumer
 has full information of the risks and incentives related to her wealth
 (i.e.
 the economy functions in a way that these risks are known to the consumer).
 If barriers to the flow of information or the strength of institutions
 both undergo severe changes, this exchange may become less or more feasible
 (see Hirsch

) - a phenomenon likely to occur in the economies undergoing structural
 changes (such as rapid industrialisation, higher advertising effects or
 increased centralisation of markets).
 So long as one may admit that the information about socio-economic changes
 is consumed at different speeds and extent amongst the consumers than firms
 then it must follow that the two consider the information of risks differently.
 The consumption in the short-term would thus always be influenced by asymmetrie
s in the observation of risk i.e.
 a perceived uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the different levels of uncertainty to make any empirical sense, the
 subjective views of the consumer must be rationalised with the observed
 economic variables in the long run.
 This is achieved with the revelation of the consumer's subjective behaviour.
 As the resources in an economy evolve as they are influenced by the actions
 taken on beliefs rather than beliefs themselves, the consumer beliefs in
 the long-run, would reflect the changes in long-term assets by letting
 the risk-averse behaviours balance the risk-seeking behaviours participate
 in the same economy.
 Therefore we reconcile the consumers' subjective probability functions
 with an observed trajectory of wealth over a sufficiently long-period (
 this is implied with the properties of a probability weighting function
 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is illustrative for the purposes of this rationalisation of subjective
 probabilities to compare our approach with the permanent income hypothesis
 (PIH) in the intertemporal setting.
 Recall that the fundamental claim of PIH is that income has a transitory
 and a permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional
 to the permanent component
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancellation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 Unlike PIH however, we do not use the assumption of the independence (zero-corr
elation) between the transitory component and the permanent component -
 a condition far stronger than what is required to rationalise the subjective
 views.
 Instead of PIH's zero-correlation assumption, therefore, we have a reconciliati
on of the subjective probabilities with the observed probability in a stochastic
 process - which represents the evolution of wealth over time.
 Since there is little more than the net asset worth of the individual and
 the personal characteristics (such as social class) that are passed over
 as inheritance to the progeny, the observed probability is contributed
 to by only the assets transferred between generations in the long-run.
 On the other hand, the subjective probability of success through social
 interactions and the high quality consumption associated with it need not
 matter in the long-term - since the path to net asset worth may completely
 ignore the non-durable consumption habits of the past - except for what
 translates into the possession of long-term wealth
\bar under
.
 If we can assume a certain exogenous long-term wealth process therefore
 the subjective behaviour of the consumer could be tracked as expenditure
 above wealth-dependent needs.
 
\bar default
Unlike with a permanent income approach, therefore, the two uncertainties
 which we have outlined are not expected to be independent of each other
 but are reconciled by the transfer and ownership of long-term assets in
 the economy.
 The key difference in our approach - in comparison to PIH - is that we
 view risk not merely as dispersion in income amongst socio-economic classes
 (gauged with a simple variance in past income) but as part of more general
 dispersion in quality of consumption and wealth owing to social hierarchy
 in consumer choice.

 Arguing that the consumer “invests” with status consumption towards a future
 wealth position, the problem of measuring status consumption becomes equivalent
 to understanding how the consumer's loss aversion for wealth and risk-seeking
 behaviour towards future gains could influence her investments towards
 future wealth.
 The consumer perception of risk and future wealth is thus formulated as
 a lottery scheme enumerating choices of chosen risk and value for the PT
 utility.
 The resulting formulation with utility under risk also allows us to endogenise
 the role of demographic characteristics which influence consumption through
 perception of risk (i.e.
 the weighted probability function).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This view of status consumption as simply excess non-durable consumption
 above needs may appear incongruous with how conspicuous consumption is
 seen in the public discourse i.e.
 as a phenomenon that only-serves-the-rich.
 A conspicuous item is commonly viewed as one that can be used both to distance
 oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those above oneself,
 but there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst the rich
 than its utility to the middle classes.
 If one could admit a definition of status consumption as a means to distinguish
 oneself from one's own reference group and agree that everyone does belong
 to a particular reference group, then it follows that everyone can benefit
 from status consumption (i.e.
 a probabilistic improvement of the consumer's perceived status can be achieved
 with status consumption).
 Further, if the long-term consumption is defined as assets that stay the
 same over many generations (so that all else is considered non-durable)
 then a focus on non-durable consumption sufficiently captures the sense
 of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of significant wealth differences, another reason to object
 to the view of status consumption as a consumption exclusive to the rich
 is that the utility to the rich from status consumption might be quite
 little given that the rich consumer already has enough to distance herself
 from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich ignores the advantage of status consumption to those who are neither
 extremely rich nor extremely poor.
 It may also rule out the conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't
 have anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to
 leave anyone behind).
 With a general view of conscpicuous consumption, one could argue that even
 the poorest may want to indicate that they are not the poorest - much the
 way richest may want it to be known to the others that they are indeed
 the richest

 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 may in fact be needed by both the rich and the poor.

 getting poorer and try to become the richest at all times.

By considering the asset hierarchies and the competition, we consider to
 varied opportunities between social groups.
 We believe that the differences in classes and occupations are not merely
 of wealth - but of future perceptions and realisations of wealth changes
 (i.e.
 both special and general probabilities).
 Karelis talks about this.
 There is another complication to the model that we consider.
 It is that the extreme differences are not sustainable if the consumers
 have to survive.
 This is because compassion and conflict also exist aside with competition.
 The qualities of compassion may co-exist with qualities of segregation
 - the rich and poor both may want an exchange where the rich can be compassiona
te and the poor needy but respectful and optimistic (see Karelis).
 The consumption itself has qualities of segregation in the sense that it
 creates needs that won't be fulfilled in the poorer group- so the segregation
 stabilises.

JUST INTUITIVELY, we should also be clear about why risk-seeking and risk-averse

 high probability) - the poor risk-seeking class and vs high-alpha (overvalue
 high-probability - assuming it to be certain and undervaluing low-probability)
 - the rich class (not necessarily risk-averse).
 These are characteristics are more likely to depend on social factors other
 than the starting point of wealth differences - which matter less when
 the needs have been addressed (see other chapter where we discuss about
 extreme wealth differences).
 Risk preferences are more sticky (stable) and related to occupation and
 structures.
 Status consumption is for the more risk-seeking types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
==
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, our approach to status consumption is similar in many ways to
 the one adopted in many recent studies on visible consumption - as it views
 a consumer's net utility from status consumption as a combination of private
 utility (subjective) and public utility (observed through rise in wealth).
 Where it differs fundamentally is in its treatment of uncertainty - establishin
g a relationship between the extreme wealth differences and the upside risk
 with consumption.
 Formulating status consumption as uncertainty associated with the future
 states of wealth and the utility from status consumption as a probabilistic
 private utility, we use prospect theory (PT) to understand a competition
 for status.
 A key difference from the approach taken in much of the literature on visible
 consumption is therefore that the status utility from such consumption
 is not futile in a material sense - a luxury watch may be futile for private
 use by itself (when compared to its cheaper alternatives that offer the
 same functionality i.e.
 that of telling the current time) but if an aspiring businessman uses his
 knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business, then
 the futile consumption may probabilistically translate into a material
 advantage.
 The promise of social mobility is indeed the core appeal of status consumption.
 Items like luxury watches are in fact important only because the rich flock
 around them 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indeed if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile - a non-materialist sense that our model is not concerned with.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We thus argue that the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may
 offer is important to the consumer as it acts as a means of connecting
 the rich with the not-so rich in the long-term.
 Further, the consumption of status item is driven by a small chance of
 success - a probability which the risk-seeking (risk-averse) consumer is
 likely to overestimate (underestimate).
 In the long-term one must reconcile the subjective probabilities with an
 observed wealth process - as only a few of the purchasers of luxury watches
 would improve their self-image and enhance their social networks to achieve
 material wealth - others would remain mere purchasers.

[NO DISCOUNTING, NO GROWTH] A typical intertemporal model of substitution
 between savings and consumption relies on observed income, savings, an
 interest rate of growth as well as depreciation and/or discounting factors.
 Following this approach, if consumption could be split into certain and
 uncertain parts, the two could have been discounted at different rates
 - an approach similar to what is followed in literature (see for example
 Cagetti
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 where discounting is associated education and other demographic variables).
 The reason we refrain from assuming a depreciation (or a discount factor)
 and a growth-rate for wealth is simply that the latter assume too much
 about the consumer expectations for future wealth whose relationship with
 consumption we wish to understand.
 The ideas of depreciation and interest-rate are in fact based on some elaborate
 arguments on consumer impatience and opportunity from the last century
 and before - the concepts that have since been revised (see Fisher

\begin_layout Standard
[TWO CONSUMER MODEL] The model considers a competition of status between
 two consumers that have different levels of starting wealth but otherwise
 similar except in the level of risk they're willing two takes.
 While the competition for status is one of relative wealth (assets), the
 evaluation of future risks does affect their intertemporal choice.
 In a given period of the intertemporal model, the consumer can either spend
 a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 or save towards the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we assume no natural depreciation, a reduction in wealth is only
 through direct expenditure - which in turns consists only of consumption
 or investment (apart from a cost of owning assets - if any).
 Contrasting with a growth and depreciation approach, the wealthier of the
 two consumers in the model does not silently earn interest on income -
 but has to compete with others who are acquiring new wealth by investing
 into newer areas.
 Competing with others while guarding one's wealthier status, the consumer
 has no choice but to bet on uncertain pursuits in order for her to grow
 her wealth

 It follows that the process must depend on an attribute common to both

 This better represents the finiteness of resources where the rewards for

 The reward to risk would therefore decline or rise only with the

 It is assumed that both the consumers are aware of the finiteness of resources

When the consumers are in an environment where returns to risk rise as the

 In the real world, this may correspond to new opportunities where crowding

 Since the real world is a long-term cyclical process of unpredictable crests
 and troughs, the process of returns-to-risks decays or rises with both
 time and effort as the two consumers may be in regimes of rise or decline
 (where opportunities expand or contract respectively).
 Here, we assume that while the consumer may be aware of being in in regime
 of rise or decline, the have neither control nor foresight of when the
 regimes could switch.
 In that sense, the decision of the consumers is always myopic.

In terms of an analogy for such a wealth process, consider a gold-rush economy
 with two consumers where more digging increases the chances of getting

 Let's assume that the consumers are dynasties - and the life-cycle effects
 are to be ignored.
 Here, searching for mining opportunities is comparable to finding new wealth
 in an economy - where luck only favours the prepared and the hard-working.
 The random process of wealth thus does not favour a particular consumer

 Further, it is also implied that if a consumer makes no new investments
 (in search for more goldmines) the competing consumers might find more
 wealth leading to her relative poverty.
 Indeed this can be true but only as long there are gold mines in the area.
 Competing consumers all know of the finiteness of gold resources at all
 times but they don't make any judgments about when the last gold mine would

 While the natural process is indeed meant to be fair, the perceptions arising

 The aim of the model is to specify the need for status consumption within
 the framework of uncertainty with future wealth.
 Our notion of status has not changed - and it can be interpreted in the
 model (and in the gold-rush analogy) as a consumer with high net-worth
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and with a high likelihood of staying rich.
 Both risk and value matter in this sense of status.
 Also The consumption towards only status only occurs in presence of an
 apriori belief in the influence of status.
 One cannot assume that consumers would purchase status items if they didn't
 believe they would get something out of it in the long-term.
 Thus status consumption is inherent in the future projection of wealth.
 Of the individuals 1 and 2, for example, 1 could be a of higher status
 if she is expected to have a higher likelihood of wealth projected by herself.
 Whether the other consumer 2 also projects the consumer 1 to have a higher
 wealth or not depends on how the two exchange the information about each
 other.
 This is where status consumption comes into play.
 The value the status consumption carries to the consumer is then straightforwar
d - as it's merely the average loss incurred by the consumer when she chooses
 over the long-term in absence of having exchanged the information about
 the other consumer as part of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the gold-rush analogy, status consumption would equivalent to the any
 signal which indicates a higher subjective likelihood of finding gold in
 the future.
 A consumer who can let herself and the other consumer believe that is she
 is poised to find the next big mine would clearly carry higher status as
 long as she is already the richer consumer.
 That a wealth loss would lower her status is obvious.
 But that a disbelief in her future prospects could also be damaging to
 status.
 Status consumption provide the security of this shared belief to the richer
 consumer.
 They could benefit the poorer .
 Notice that by itself status consumption or this signal of projected wealth
 has no value (as it always requires labor

In the real world, there is an uncertainty association with the value (and
 therefore the utility) assigns to investments (consumption such as education
 and lifestyle choices) .
 In empirical term such investments are not a direct constraint imposed
 by the assets one acquires but are expected to provide an unlikely (risky)
 payoff through social or positional improvement.
 Status competitions are expected to thrive when consumers take over the
 manners of those richer than themselves (i.e.
 those with seemingly achievable differences in wealth levels) and acquire
 assets that are as good as theirs.
 To each participating consumer, status consumption provides a promise of
 better social positioning as well as an improvement in her self-image -
 realised through the relative quality in consumption when not through real
 wealth.
 Outside this perceived subjective future of one’s wealth, status consumption
 has in fact no significance.
 Status consumption only results because of what consumer belief is of status
 value.
 In the stochastic setting that we have just outlined, the status consumption
 can only arise from the factor that influence how consumer projects her
 total wealth - This affects not her past or current acquisitions and income
 but also the risky-attitude.
 The best way to to use in the model is a gain/loss utility..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All consumption that isn’t realised into material asset gains over a long
 period of time – is of a subjective value to the consumer.
 The uncertainty in wealth is modelled with a “natural” stochastic process
 that rewards the consumers consumption with a certain probability.
 While this natural process does not distinguish between the consumers,
 the consumer decisions are shaped by their attitudes to risk.
 The model therefore attempts to understand how wealth differences could
 develop when consumers differ in risk-attitudes while observing a common
 stochastic process of wealth changes.
 The consumer’s subjectivity to this “natural” process of income / wealth
 is implied by the weights she assigns to be various probabilities of wealth
 transition.

Status consumption in the presence of such a risky wealth process implies
 that the premium which consumers pay to participate in the game of status
 can work only as long as a probability of finding gold is non-zero.
 There signaling would stop when there growth opportunities have died and
 the states must wait either for a redistribution to start or the finding
 rates to rise again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To formalise the stochastic setting, assume a process that scales up the
 probability of income gain from the risky investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 so that an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is rewarded to the consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a random variable observed in the economy.
 Here, the diminishing returns for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 are only through combined 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}(t)+\psi_{2}(t)$
\end_inset

).
 In the gold-rush analogy, digging more mines cannot infinitely increase
 one's wealth at a non-decreasing rate and therefore it does not pay off
 to put infinite sized bets on 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 We assume 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a Bernoulli trial providing an uncertain payoff.
  If we can assume a certain rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 at which the consumption depletes the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 As we'll later see, the consumer might run out income in a wealth competition
 much before the wealth opportunities dry up
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Due to this, the introduction of credit for a consumer once her disposable
 income dries out is not different from starting with a different wealth.
 In other words, providing a credit line to a consumer amounts to starting
 the evolution of wealth with a different (lower or higher) initial income
 for the two consumers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Such a drying up of one's disposable income from which risky positions
 would be further exacerbated if we introduce an asset costs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to the costs which the owned assets bear in the real-world)
 so that the assets would decline to zero in if there is no return from
 the investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 .
 It follows that no one would forgo their needs to take risk since the needs
 of the consumer are meant to grow as her wealth levels rise (even at a
 faster rate for higher levels of wealth - when considering the costs of
 labour, upkeep and maintenance etc.).
 Exhaustion of disposable income would stagnate the consumer's prospsects
 and there there may be a justfication of a redistribution from the richer
 consumers that would ensue in an extremely unequal setting (too much difference
 in values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$

 For example, if we use a CRRA utilty, then

 The measure of risk-aversion

LOTTERY FORMULATION
\series default
] We view the consumer's intertemporal choice as a simple lottery scheme.
 Since staying in an elite non-durable consumption club offers only a probabilis
tic benefit, we represent the consumer's choice as one amognst many lotteries.
 The practical examples of such expenditure could be a private club memberships
 or an expertise in conspicuous items (watches, cars etc.) which might eventually
 get the consumer in the rich club - over generations if not immediately
 - albeit with a probability lower than those with a higher starting wealth.
 The various lotteries available to the consumer could range from a secure
 cash savings to a balanced strategy of spending towards education in the
 hope for income rise over years or a bet on an expensive club membership
 in a hope for relevant social connections.
 Note the consumer's own risk-profile always influences the selection of
 a particular lottery.
 In other words, the same observed probability may be considered too risky
 or not risky enough for consumers with different degrees of risk-aversion
 (a feature that is modeled with the probability weighting function

 As the consumer's investments (i.e.
 consumption which is indistinguishable from needs) are hoped to increase
 the asset in some way, the expectation of growth in one's assets is embedded
 in the expenditure one makes.
 Anything that is not expended contributes to the saving towards wealth
 for the consumer.
 Over time the wealth can either decline significantly or grow in value
 due to the strategy adopted by the consumer.

Using prospect theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 we can now elaborate a utility function that evaluates the various lotteries
 for a consumer.
 Any given lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L$

 is seen as a sequence of payoffs 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $u(L)=\sum_{i}w(p_{i})\upsilon(x_{i})$

 (
\begin_inset Formula $w(p)$
\end_inset

 is the probability weighting function and 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(x)$
\end_inset

 is the payoff-utility function for the consumer).
 If we assign probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 to the various options 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 distributed with a known distribution function to the consumer, we can
 assess the relative importance of the options to the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising again that since we're considering utility from
 relative non-durable consumption, the needs of the consumer have no role
 to play in the utility as needs are meant to be common across both the
 consumers by definition.
 Another simplifiying assumption we make is that the consumers in the model
 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dynasties
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which observe a risky growth of long-term (inter-generational) wealth.
 The effect of family size and of life-cycle are therefore ignored in the
 model.
 To consider a long-term equilibrium we consider extreme wealth differences
 are not sustainable in a society and necessitate an income redistribution
 (e.g.
 taxation) (see Karelis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KarelisPoverty2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Given that the status of an individual comprises both of wealth and consumption
 on status goods, the key question we wish to answer with the model is whether
 the risk-averse consumers may settle for less status consumption when competing
 with those having higher wealth possession or not.
 In other words, are separating equilibria likely when payoffs-from risk
 at lower investments differ a lot from payoff-from-risk at lower investments.
 That can be answered only if we have a justification for status consumption.

Using PT allows us to incorporate the desired feature where not every consumer
 has same response to the same

 to differentiate the risk-seeking behaviour from the risk-averse behaviour.
 Also since we let the consumption and investments

 need to worry about the combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 It's like having an infinite well or the infinite sky with lesser chances

 Assuming that such a distribution is known we could have a situation when

) is therefore shared between the two consumers with different risk-profiles.
 The conclusions of the model could help us refine how redistribution policies
 such as taxation might allow an equilibrium for risk-seeking and risk-averse
 individuals to exist.
 This is relevant for status consumption since the risk-sharing across groups
 segmented by social strata, occupation or class - would imply that status
 consumption is not necessarily important when the class differences are
 strong.
 Indeed an income-sharing arrangement does influence status consumption
 through the risk-sharing as well.
 This is the refinement that we had sought for understanding how wealth
 differences affect status consumption.

[HOW IS THIS RELATED with risk perception] A desirable feature of the above
 framework is that it also endogenises social characteristics vector as
 the consumer's notion of subjectivity.
 The roots of subjective inference lie in exchangeability

 Despite carrying the same

 significance, the very presence of social hierarchy means that the individuals
 would associate a higher subjective probability with a certain characteristics

 Such preferences are hardly anomalies but reflect a long-term security
 perceived by individuals that they associate with characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 Modeling subective probability is therefore a natural first step to incorporati
ng social characteristics in the intertemporal.
 It is also implied that to consider an empirical case for the model with
 more than two consumers, the risk-equilibria should be sought for groups
 segmented by the

[CYCLE IN ECONOMY] As such, the inheritable wealth would decline in value
 when it's not invested in any growing economy.
 In a declining economy (consider depletion of gold in our example), even
 though wealth may depreciate slower it would still keep the consumer's
 relative advantage to others and the consumers would continue to form an
 expectation of increased future wealth just the same.
 It can be argued that wealth in the economy is important not only because
 of the purchasing power but fundamentally due to the social order in the
 form of an expectation held by other participants in the economy that they
 can replicate the success of the wealthy by acting as participants in the
 economy

Model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of status consumption, the influence is that risk would not be
 taken.
 We’re using that split in the context of PT – where choosing 
\backslash
psi is likely choosing a risk – choosing no risk is to choose a definite
 decline or status-quo.
 The utility is provided both by A and psi – but we assume a separation
 of A and psi using the PT-like utility – so that u(A,psi) is simply value
 of A under risk as a function of psi.
 The next complication is the stochastic reference point – due to the various
 states the competitor may be in.
 [Difference in speed] The difference in stochastic speeds is the key issue
 in the model.
 Consumer decisions are myopic.
 If we were to do 3-period analysis we can assume that consumer’s don’t
 know the 3rd period – there is no extension possible without formalising
 the long-term evolution of p.
 Our model is similar to Koszegi, but different because we look towards
 status consumption- which is gain loss only after subject to needs – level.
 [NASH] Shalev 2000 show that pure-strategy Nash equilibria are always myopic
 loss-aversion equilibria.
 Also see how loss-aversion breaks demand-law (Koszegi-Rabin) the same there
 is a break in the price of relative quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[MYOPIA] Time-horizons for consumer decision are a key feature of the model.
 The consumers are assumed to be myopic in making decisions towards a risky
 allocation as they have no way of predicting the decline or rise in p and
 act upon the current value of p.
 More particularly, the consumer decision at time t assumes that p stays
 the same in the near future (whereas the consumer’s wealth might grow unexpecte
dly with the probability p).
 The dynamics of the model are so that p declines much slower than the consumers
 would scale their allocation to upside or downside risks.
 With respect to the returns they their efforts (allocation), the consumer
 do know the cost of owning assets i.e.
 how much their costs of living as well as taxation which rise if they own
 accumulate more assets (wealth).
 [REWARD FOR RISK] The program assumes A_{t+1} = A_{t} + R*W*psi – i.e.
 the payoff scales up with “effort” or the allocation.
 The natural process therefore doesn’t favour the rich over the poor but
 just rewards participants based on the total amount of money spent.
 This is a basic set up - the behaviour of the consumer in response to a
 stochastic process interests us more than how well this process represents
 the real economy.
 We wish to quantitatively explain the effect of taxation and asset-cost
 structures on status consumption among consumers with different by risk-seeking
 levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[RISK-ATTITUDES and STATUS CONSUMPTION] We consider two types of consumers
 – based on the weighted function.
 The low-alpha consumer is one who overvalues low – probability and takes
 high probability as certain.
 The other user ignores low-probability events (as if they didn’t exist)
 and overvalues high-probability events – treating them almost certain.
 Evidently, the low-alpha individual is far more likely to engage in status
 consumption than the high-alpha individual as the latter may remain circumspect
 about taking chances in small probability social mobility bets – and consider
 tax-income certain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Equations]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[MECHANICS] The goal of the model is to highlight the concerns of relative
 growth in income/wealth in an environment where risk-attitudes are fixed
 due to occupational and social structures as is the starting wealth difference.
 By choosing to keep her asset account the same and not participate in a
 risky allocation, a consumer essentially gives up the hope of closing the
 wealth gap.
 The extent to which the wealth differences matter to the consumer – are
 implied with a mid-point reference to her utility.
 If the consumer is (relatively) poor, a loss aversion would make her desperate
 to move away from being poor and become more likely to overvalue small
 risks (than in a situation where she is relatively rich) – as the tendencies
 of loss aversion kick in under relative poverty (with respect to a certain
 point of reference).
 Similarly, the richer consumer would be less reluctant to taking risks
 (than when she is relatively poorer).
 The stochastic dynamics imply that the richer consumer may encourage the
 poorer consumer by raising her mid-point reference point (and making the
 poorer consumer more risk-taking than she otherwise would be).
 Status consumption – as this risky allocation – must rise and fall with
 risk-preferences as well.
 The consumer moving towards relative poverty might therefore increase status
 consumption even though moving together towards poverty would always reduce
 status consumption.
 We use the trajectory of risky consumption to explain how a given taxation
 policy and asset cost structure may characterise status consumption in
 an economy.
 [Stability: TAXES and ASSET-COSTS] The above dynamics would imply that
 asset differences would be much higher than their starting points if a
 risk-taking consumer gets richer and the opportunities to gain mobility
 (return from the wealth process) dry up – leaving no chance for the poorer
 consumer to participate in the wealth game.
 To reduce final wealth differences and to leave the game in a state ripe
 enough until a natural process reinvigorates with more wealth, a taxation
 rate provides an additional control to the wealth differences in the wealth
 game.
 Such taxation pressures would increase or decrease with asset differences
 in the final states.
 In quantitative terms, taxation is assumed simply as a transfer proportional
 to the wealth differences from the richer consumer to the poor consumer.
 The tax rates remain constant throughout and their effect on the future
 income are known to the consumer (i.e.
 the tax rate serve as an input in the utility function).
 We use this model to understand how taxation would influence status consumption
 in a rising and declining economy.
 The stability of the model is merely the point where the consumers have
 run out of risk-taking opportunities – as their disposable income would
 approach near zero as the wealth opportunities dry out – or reaches a level
 where expected rise in income equals 0 (or the costs of assets in a non-zero
 asset costs model).
 In other word, the equilibrium state of the model is arrived at when costs
 balance the future expectation of income (wealth changes).
 Since our natural process is independent of time (driven only by the effort
 put together by the participating consumers), we don’t impose any timing
 constraints in the equilibrium.
 We prefer the Monte Carlo Simulation approach for flexibility it offers
 for the utility functions.
 In an environment of growth – where the probability of success increases
 with more effort, the growth is modelled as exponential in the beginning
 and stabilises at a specified probability.
 Similarly, in an environment of declining growth the probability would
 stabilise at a lower value.
 The equilibria that implied by these environments are discussed in subsequent
 sections.
 While we don’t consider the environment of a high chance of success (high
 p), notice in the probability the consumer with lower-alpha – who can be
 seen as risk-seeking at low probabilities - becomes risk-averse as she
 is circumspect about high probability whereas the high alpha consumer –
 who is risk-averse at low probabilities which she ignore – would appear
 risk-seeking as she always takes high probability to be granted.
 [Classes not implemented]: The real world is full of lacunae where consumers
 linger by limiting their needs.
 Above model implements this only partly by allowing consumers to take extreme
 risks.
 A more real-world scenario might consider multiple references points that
 maintain common-relative distances from each other – such a set up might
 represent the observed stratification in societies.
 More specifically, the consumers observing different reference points would
 observe – more complicated than when a single reference point that drives
 risk-attitude and asset differences to explain all observed social differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assumption 1 All social differences are represented by asset differences
 and risk-attitudes (alpha value).
 Assumption 2 The characteristics of the consumer are stationary.
 This means that the consumer characteristics don’t change because of evolution.
 Assumption 3 The consumers don’t observe long-term changes in p.
 Assumption 4 High-alpha consumer is less likely to engage in status consumption.

Switching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being risk-seeking provide higher relative wealth when the return for risk
 is high enough and the other consumer makes lesser effort.
 On the other hand, it pays off to be risk-averse p is too low.
 Therefore the consumer would switch to being risk-averse only if she is
 confident that p is not enough for the other consumer to close the wealth
 gap.
 Let’s say that the consumer works based on the expected time until when
 the other consumer would close the wealth gap – an expected value that
 would decrease as the p goes up or the other consumer becomes more risk-seeking.
 The poor consumer has no option to switch to being risk-averse except when
 the finding rate is too low (and being risk-seeking would hurt) and/or
 when there is taxation.
 Otherwise, extreme loss aversion would mean that she would take whatever
 risk there is to take.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[COST OF SWITCHING] It is tempting to argue the market for status consumption
 is deliberately created by the rich to engage the relatively poor in futile
 consumption – but we need to understand if there is any gain from switching
 or adjusting one’s risk-aversion alpha (Also, one must refrain from determining
 the definition of switching by the goals of switching).
 Fundamentally, switching is merely “increasing or decreasing” of one’s
 risk-seeking for a certain cost (if it was free, the consumer would already
 have it – the only reason it must appear in the model is that it also costs
 something).
 The consumer gain from risk-seeking in a high-p environment – so in an
 environment of declining p, staying risk-averse might pay off more.
 [ No Signaling ] This is not so much about signal to others or inferring
 a certain image from others – which seems to provide utility – but selfish
 agents who want to maximise (risk-aversion – which is purportedly modified
 by status consumptions is does not indicate anything to anybody else except
 oneself).
 This risk-seeking merely a stronger belief in a more prosperous future
 (or a nearer future) - a self-confidence that translates into higher risk-seeki
ng.
 If switching to risk-seeking in a high p (or rising in time T) environment
 does benefit the consumer, just how much is this increase in risk-seeking
 worth? Would the consumer rather invest in the risky stock and hope for
 winning over time – or would she rather spend on this confidence-booster
 instead? This should be explained by the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[TRIGGER of the SWITCH] For there to be a cost , we also need to understand
 the place of the switch in the dynamics.
 Given that the consumer gains more in sufficiently near term by risk-seeking,
 at what point does the poor or rich consumer decide that she needs to be
 more risk-seeking or less? More particularly, if the two consumers are
 competing, how does one know that she is has too little or too high aversion
 or propensity for risk.
 The trigger can’t be the asset differences between them – which are already
 accounted for in the reference point.
 Status consumption is of only subjective value in the model – so the idea
 extreme differences in wealth (i.e.
 a certain level of distance from reference point) discourages status consumptio
n does not make sense.
 One needs to be more specific about the dynamics – either by deciding how
 expected time in the long-run decides psi and alpha i.e.
 dynamics control the alpha more generally.
 One idea is that past values are projected onto the future – i.e.
 the consumers becomes risk-seeking when they see incomes rising- whether
 those who assets are declining or not also become risk-averse is less intuitive
 and require some E_T(A)or discounting based-logic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With dynamics, specified we should be able to specify the ultimate price
 someone is willing to pay for status consumption i.e.
 what does status consumption can give at most to the consumer.
 This is probably the most important question in the context of status consumpti
on.
 In the real-world, what is the price someone is willing to pay for being
 rich (given that they may not know what being rich entails – i.e.
 the poor isn’t aware of the true risk of the wealth i.e.
 the risk-aversion level of the consumer – so she can only take risk-aversion
 or risk-seeking).
 If one were to play the Bayesian (signaling)game, the consumers have all
 information for each other except the level of risk-aversion the rich or
 the poor may have.
 These are revealed only when wealth levels cross.
 We can take inspiration from the fact that – human company in the real-world
 makes others like themselves and hence a risk-averse consumer may make
 someone else more risk-averse (as the risk-seeking makes others more risk-seeki
ng).

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[NOW WHERE DOES LDC-DC COMPARISON COME FROM?] A key feature of the model
 is that it allows us to compare status consumption in a developed economy
 with that in a developing economy.
 From the point of view of the consumer's perception of risk - which the
 model incorporates - the most relevant difference between the developing
 countries and the developed countries is that of the strength of welfare
 institutions.
 In a developed economy, the state institutions intervene when market forces
 aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertakings or to distribut
e items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world - often failing to provide incentives to the private enterprise
 for distribution of public goods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 This has implications for status consumption.
 Consider basic education - which may be of status importance in the developing
 economy in a way that it isn't in the developed economy.
 This is primarily because the distribution of education (and other similar
 assets that may be public goods) is state-assisted in a developed country
 and the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny is lowered.
 Thus, the extent to which education may eventually matter towards status
 in the developed economy depends on how consumers set themselves apart
 in the social order based on other means of signaling status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), the expected growth
 from education is higher (observed probability).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[CAVEAT] We believe that the selection of a distribution is best left for
 the empirical data to dictate - particularly since the choice of risk is
 hardly one-dimensional in any real-life scenario.
 At any point, a consumer takes multiple risks by distributing her consumption
 across multiple commodities.
 In a developing economy, basic education may be a high-risk / high-reward
 expenditure if it is sparingly available, but it may be fairly low-risk
 low-reward expenditure in a developed country with state-supported education.
 The expected upside risks with selection of residential neighborhood may
 similarly be fairly low-risk low-reward in densely populated areas but
 low-risk high-reward in rural areas.
 The task to represent all risks the consumers takes in a given economy
 as a one-dimensional random variable is one that may require critical assumptio
ns.

\begin_layout Standard
[NOBODY WANTS TO ENDOGENISE - STRIKE IT] Relating inter-generational mobility
 with status consumption allows us to endogenise the role of social characterist
ics in the population as well.
 In the presence of social segregation or extreme wealth differences, the
 formulation can help answer whether the visible consumption identified
 through surveys can sufficiently capture the concern for status consumption
 or not.
 The uncertainty-based framework can also be used to understand the net
 impact of taxation on the  indirect risk-sharing - which is implied with
 the presence of long-term wealth-differences.

\begin_layout Standard
A possible criticism of the approach may be our assumption that the basic
 consumer needs are always met for the consumers.
 This however could be easily addressed by constraining the choice for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 in the stochastic model - by enforcing the risk-aversion of those whose
 basic needs are not met (forcing them to address basic needs and add very

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraint of observed risk (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

) being the same for all consumers could be in relieved a future extension
 of the model - since the intergenerational mobility in a real economy tends
 to vary across regions.
 The regional variations would imply necessarily that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 for one consumer be different from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 It could also be argued that the players in an economy can also influence
 the known risks of each other (see the discussion on information barriers
 and delay in Section
