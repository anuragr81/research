A risk-perspective of status consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is developed by viewing all status-related
 consumption as perceived investments towards future mobility in consumer
 wealth.
 A framework where an economic value of status consumption is presented
 with model of anticipatory emotions as the basis for theory of utility
 under risk.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[RETRIAL 1] We view status consumption as consumption in excess of wealth-adjust
ed needs a risky investment towards the consumer’s perceived future.
 Using a utility under risk, we explore how varied risk-attitudes could
 result in long-term differences under rising and declining phases of economic
 growth.
 The role of taxation policies in status consumption as risky allocations
 is also discussed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The studies on conspicuous consumption have recently explored visible consumptio
n in the developing economies.
 As a specific instance of status consumption, visible consumption is assumed
 to occur through a certain type of (visible) goods that are futile for
 the consumer.
 The assumption permits the separability of demand for visible goods from
 non-visible goods in the empirically analyses - where the separation between
 visible and non-visible goods is arrived at with independent surveys.
 Instead of using an approach that relies on such a survey of visible items
 we review what status consumption would mean in the context of wealth differenc
es and social stratification - whose effects may not be captured by a simple
 selection of visible items in a developing economy.
 In thus restating status consumption, we bank upon the first explorations
 in status consumption where it has been identified as a way for the consumer
 to offset the existing wealth or income differences

\begin_layout Standard
[IT IS NOT PROSPECT THEORY BEING USED ] Instead of assuming that much of
 status consumption occurs through visible commodities (clothing, shoes,
 jewelry etc.), we use a framework of demand under risk - where an uncertainty
 is associated with the promotion of one's social rank.
 By elaborating a utility function comprising both of wealth differences
 and the risks associated with future wealth, we attempt to answer if a
 separating equilibrium can exist between two consumers with differing degrees
 of risk-aversion who are known to have a prospect theory (PT) behavior
 as they observe a common stochastic process with diminishing rewards for
 risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, we consider an environment where non-durable consumption
 is both an expense and a potential risky position for a future jump in
 social ranking.
 In such an environment, the end goal of the consumer would be to simply
 maximise her wealth under the observed risk.
 As an example, education is an expense where less expenditure is guaranteed
 to disadvantage the individual - both because of how her value in the employmen
t market and how it shuts (or creates) opportunities for future rises in
 her income.
 The utility for education to the consumer therefore comprises both as value
 in the market after a future education and the probability of achieving
 success.
 
\bar under
[REPHRASE] If we observe only such expenses 
\bar default
i.e.
 those which affect savings and increase the probability of wealth transition,
 then we can view status consumption as a risky investment in the framework.
 Viewing status consumption as risky lottery in a scheme where less-riskier
 choices such as education or residence, we incorporate the insights from
 PT in the formulation of status consumption as a risky choice in consumption
 
\bar under
[WHY DO WE NEED TO INCORPORATE PT]?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a simple model of choice under uncertainty that we use, income occurs
 only directly through increases in wealth.
 As reference points are key to a PT formulation, we consider a scenario
 where two consumers compete for wealth differences relative to a common
 reference point.
 The conditions for such a game to have a incentive for both the rational
 consumers (rich and poor) under PT - necessitate the diminishing returns
 from taking too much risk (and disadvantages from taking too little risk).
 The use of PT also allows us to incorporate loss-aversion in consumer choice.
 The solution of the model is used to argue whether the presence of of risk-shar
ing in growing economies that are segmented by social class could have implicati
ons for status consumption.
 We emphasise that the presence of risk-sharing across socio-economic classes
 could be as important as wealth differences - and that status consumption
 ought to be seen in the context of both.
 While the appeal for visible consumption is assumed to generally universal,
 we hope that such a framework would help us decisively explore factors
 that determine if the consumer populations in two disparate economies may
 engage in an entirely different pattern of status consumption.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods
 or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order
 to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure
 of superfluities.
 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

\begin_layout Standard
The advancements in game theory and statistics from the last century - particula
rly the theory of decision under risk - can explain some of the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour that Veblen had observed in the late
 19th century (see von Neumann-Morgenstern

 The effect that social conditions have on human behaviour is still an area
 of research (see Strauss
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a summary), but it is possible within the remit of the modern behavioural
 economics to view status consumption - i.e.
 the disproportionate spending on goods that only have a status (or visible)
 appeal - as an instance of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour.
 The two threads in the literature on status consumption which we have surveyed
 - first related to the behavioural approaches to life-cycle model and second
 related to the significance of social characteristics in visible consumption
 - could thus both be linked with such a formulation of status.
 We discuss the need for status for two competing consumers who observe
 an exogenous stochastic rate of growth.
 Using the intertemporal substitution framework, we then explore how loss-aversi
on and risk-seeking behaviours influence the consumers' balance between
 the non-durable and durable consumption.

 who seek a descriptive model for mental accounting (factors such as willpower)
 to explain observed trends in consumption.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice - where
 the consumer is subservient to her optimised plan for life-time savings
 and consumption - the representative consumer in a behavioural model is
 subject to overeating, overspending, accumulating items she doesn't need
 or acquiring habits she cannot afford (see Muellbauer

 If two consumers are to compete each other over assets, they subject themselves
 to anticipatory risk as well - theory that has been developed (see Loewesntein
 for a summary of anomalies and theories).

The second set of literature observes the demand on visible items across

 A key assumption made by such studies is that conspicuous consumption brings

 The argument - often attributed to Veblen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 (additively) from the utility for non-visible consumption (we refer to
 this assumption as the futility assumption henceforth).

 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the

 In the presence of uncertainty with wealth, the consumer's place in the
 status order can be viewed as the long-term security of the consumer from
 extreme fluctuations in her (higher) wealth.
 This is the sense in which status is usually interpreted in the studies
 in health and sociological sciences - which often track status as a vector
 of income, education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 A demand equation for status goods that considers status as a mere demographic
 vector - however - ignores the dynamic nature of status and the demand
 for bandwagon items which also influence the consumer's perception of status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status, being a social psychological concern, is observed only at the level
 of a social unit (individual or a reference group).
 So while a researcher observing a population of consumers may interpret
 status as the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk associated with the transition
 to the highest band of net-worth in the long-term - the consumer necessarily
 has a subjective view of her status.
 This subjective view of status is influenced by local factors that may
 be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

averaged out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at higher levels - what status means at the consumer's level may in fact
 even disagree with what status means at a higher level view of a society.
 This is because the consumer's view of status would respond to the socio-politi
cal conditions that she perceives from within a particular social unit (family,
 community, ethnicity or region) than to the observed variables that are
 standardised over a larger area.
 The sense of status consumption is therefore necessarily localised at the
 consumer's social reference level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is only from a certain ontological point of view, that a high-status
 individual could be seen as someone who - in the long-term - has either
 or both of high income and a high (inter-generational) probability to move
 towards the high income group (stability).
 We may call this the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of wealth transition (one may consider a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{ij}\}$
\end_inset

 representing the transition from wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 - which the researcher observes).
 A low-status individual - similarly - is someone who has either or both
 of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 Concerned with the long-term effect of such factors to the asset ownership
 and stability of income, while a researcher could assume that all consumers
 observe the same probability of transition to higher state of income, the
 consumer at local levels would in fact be motivated by the particular short-ter
m concerns with respect to the social unit that shape her view of status
 of others and her own self-image.
 The uncertainty of wealth transition is observed at multiple levels in
 this subjective formulation of probability.
 The probability of material wealth transition that a consumer associates
 with the future is fundamentally subjective - even though it is determined
 in the long-term by the factors related to social or regional identity.
 For the purposes of this discussion, we consider this latter sense as the
 consumer's 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probability of wealth transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the subjective uncertainty is a mere restatement of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in context of status and consumer decision.
 The consumer's assumed
\shape italic
 subjective 
\shape default
probability is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as her
 occupation, education, social or familial background, personality types
 etc.
 and is subject to change over her lifetime.
 As consumption is usually myopic, such a view would influence consumption
 at all times.
 This while the notion of status influences the risk-seeking behaviour of
 the consumer at local levels, the growth in the income and wealth of the
 consumer are constrained with long-term economic conditions (represented
 with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability).
 The long-term ownership of assets observed over time as the sense of consumer's
 wealth which reconciles the respective subjective probability functions
 of all the consumers.
 Such a reconciliation is possible only because in the long-term the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
subjective
\shape default
 probabilities must converge.
 This is because the subjective behaviour of the consumer would be eventually
 revealed to the external worlds (other participants).
 This is similar to how the consumer choices are revealed in an anticipatory
 equilibrium (see Koszegi 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 and Leahy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CaplinLeahyAnticipatory2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the non-durable consumption of the consumers would be associated
 with their view in the short-term, what matters in the long-term is whether
 they have achieved a higher state of wealth (and thus status) or not.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider three consumers with different
 occupations in a small economy - an academic, a sportsperson and an investor
 - who all share the share the same reference point (by assumption) for
 wealth.
 They would all estimate the probability of doubling their wealth in the
 lifetime so that they may retire on the successful achievement of their
 goal.
 Given the nature of the profession, it is likely that the sportsperson
 overestimates the probability of her success until the middle of her career
 - after which the probability she associates to the success of doubling
 her wealth (if she hasn't already) would decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus a risk-seeking behaviour would be associated with a sportsperson much
 the way a risk-averse behaviour is associated with the academic who may
 be well aware of the limited probability of a windfall in the short-term.
 On the other hand, an investor may obtain a definite gain over a fixed
 term and have a risk-profile that lies somewhere in between that of the
 sportsperson and the academic.
 While the long-term decisions of the sportsperson may still be determined
 by the knowledge of expected income, a sportsperson would be characterised
 by a belief in an unlikely probability of success in the near-term in a
 way that is different from how an academic or an investor would foresee
 her future possible wealth transition.
 If we can assume that the three consumers have the same basic needs, it
 is unlikely that the consumption of the three individuals would be independent
 of how they view the transition probability of their monetary wealth in
 the near term.
 Still in the long-term it is only their success in monetary terms that
 would track their status (assuming that exceptional performance in every
 profession is satisfactorily rewarded in monetary terms).
 To state whether a risk-seeking consumer spends more or less on non-durable
 consumption we attempt to understand the consumer's goal in the intertemporal
 setting (where status consumption may appear to be less beneficial than
 saving for assets)(see Lowenstein for a discounting function
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

The fulfilment of basic consumer needs itself carries no influence on status.
 Thus if we were to compare the consumption of a risk-seeking consumers

This is further elaborated with aniticipatory emotions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-durable consumption serves two purposes - first it is tied with the
 level of consumer's needs - which in turn may depend on her wealth level.
 The part of non-durable consumption that is not associated the encapsulates
 a view of the future perception of her wealth.
 This allows us to view the consumer utility as a combination of - the latter
 being associate with the subjective probability.
 For example, those who hope to enhance their social network or get ahead
 of others through signaling are likely to believe in a higher likelihood
 of their promotion to a higher status.
 A higher probability for the state promotion perceived by a risk-seeking
 consumer would amount to a a higher (subjective) weight for the same observed
 probability.
 Similarly, the perceived (weighted) probability of loss of one's status
 would be higher (e.g.
 that of the threat of immigration to one's personal wealth) than the

# The subjective probabilities are not unrelated to the information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, it is worthwhile to speak of the economic processes that
 are implied by an interplay of the two levels of uncertainties that we
 use to relate risk-aversion with consumption.
 One way to view the two uncertainties is as a delay or barriers in the
 flow of information related to risks in the consumer markets.
 When it comes to risks to the future wealth, the firms and institutions
 are often better equipped and more responsive than the individuals or small
 communities.
 The differences in subjective uncertainties and observed uncertainties
 matter only because of the differences in how information is consumed at
 different levels of societal organisation (e.g.
 at the level of consumption and at the level where incomes are distributed).
 Such a presence of barriers to information also indicates a limit to the
 free-market assumption of an autonomous consumer fully capable of addressing
 her true needs (see a discussion in Hirsch

 sections of a society and their desire for mobility can drive the consumption

).
 But the implicit assumption in the free market view of an exchange between
 the rich and poor sections driving economic progress is that the consumer
 has full information of the risks and incentives related to her wealth
 (i.e.
 the economy functions in a way that these risks are known to the consumer).
 If barriers to the flow of information or the strength of institutions
 both undergo severe changes, this exchange may become less or more feasible
 (see Hirsch

) - a phenomenon likely to occur in the economies undergoing structural
 changes (such as rapid industrialisation, higher advertising effects or
 increased centralisation of markets).
 So long as one may admit that the information about socio-economic changes
 is consumed at different speeds and extent amongst the consumers than firms
 then it must follow that the two consider the information of risks differently.
 The consumption in the short-term would thus always be influenced by asymmetrie
s in the observation of risk i.e.
 a perceived uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the different levels of uncertainty to make any empirical sense, the
 subjective views of the consumer must be rationalised with the observed
 economic variables in the long run.
 This is achieved with the revelation of the consumer's subjective behaviour.
 As the resources in an economy evolve as they are influenced by the actions
 taken on beliefs rather than beliefs themselves, the consumer beliefs in
 the long-run, would reflect the changes in long-term assets by letting
 the risk-averse behaviours balance the risk-seeking behaviours participate
 in the same economy.
 Therefore we reconcile the consumers' subjective probability functions
 with an observed trajectory of wealth over a sufficiently long-period (
 this is implied with the properties of a probability weighting function
 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is illustrative for the purposes of this rationalisation of subjective
 probabilities to compare our approach with the permanent income hypothesis
 (PIH) in the intertemporal setting.
 Recall that the fundamental claim of PIH is that income has a transitory
 and a permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional
 to the permanent component
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components
\end_layout

\end_inset

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancellation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 Unlike PIH however, we do not use the assumption of the independence (zero-corr
elation) between the transitory component and the permanent component -
 a condition far stronger than what is required to rationalise the subjective
 views.
 Instead of PIH's zero-correlation assumption, therefore, we have a reconciliati
on of the subjective probabilities with the observed probability in a stochastic
 process - which represents the evolution of wealth over time.
 Since there is little more than the net asset worth of the individual and
 the personal characteristics (such as social class) that are passed over
 as inheritance to the progeny, the observed probability is contributed
 to by only the assets transferred between generations in the long-run.
 On the other hand, the subjective probability of success through social
 interactions and the high quality consumption associated with it need not
 matter in the long-term - since the path to net asset worth may completely
 ignore the non-durable consumption habits of the past - except for what
 translates into the possession of long-term wealth
\bar under
.
 If we can assume a certain exogenous long-term wealth process therefore
 the subjective behaviour of the consumer could be tracked as expenditure
 above wealth-dependent needs.
 
\bar default
Unlike with a permanent income approach, therefore, the two uncertainties
 which we have outlined are not expected to be independent of each other
 but are reconciled by the transfer and ownership of long-term assets in
 the economy.
 The key difference in our approach - in comparison to PIH - is that we
 view risk not merely as dispersion in income amongst socio-economic classes
 (gauged with a simple variance in past income) but as part of more general
 dispersion in quality of consumption and wealth owing to social hierarchy
 in consumer choice.
 Consequently, we do not explicitly ignore the role of

 if the consumer is meant to always achieve the goal of improving her wealth

 If conspicuous consumption were truly futile, then there would be no way
 for the rational consumer to derive any utility from status-related consumption.
 The explicit subjective uncertainty - represented with a probability weighting

 Arguing that the consumer “invests” with status consumption towards a future
 wealth position, the problem of measuring status consumption becomes equivalent
 to understanding how the consumer's loss aversion for wealth and risk-seeking
 behaviour towards future gains could influence her investments towards
 future wealth.
 The consumer perception of risk and future wealth is thus formulated as
 a lottery scheme enumerating choices of chosen risk and value for the PT
 utility.
 The resulting formulation with utility under risk also allows us to endogenise
 the role of demographic characteristics which influence consumption through
 perception of risk (i.e.
 the weighted probability function).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This view of status consumption as simply excess non-durable consumption
 above needs may appear incongruous with how conspicuous consumption is
 seen in the public discourse i.e.
 as a phenomenon that only-serves-the-rich.
 A conspicuous item is commonly viewed as one that can be used both to distance
 oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those above oneself,
 but there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst the rich
 than its utility to the middle classes.
 If one could admit a definition of status consumption as a means to distinguish
 oneself from one's own reference group and agree that everyone does belong
 to a particular reference group, then it follows that everyone can benefit
 from status consumption (i.e.
 a probabilistic improvement of the consumer's perceived status can be achieved
 with status consumption).
 Further, if the long-term consumption is defined as assets that stay the
 same over many generations (so that all else is considered non-durable)
 then a focus on non-durable consumption sufficiently captures the sense
 of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of significant wealth differences, another reason to object
 to the view of status consumption as a consumption exclusive to the rich
 is that the utility to the rich from status consumption might be quite
 little given that the rich consumer already has enough to distance herself
 from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich ignores the advantage of status consumption to those who are neither
 extremely rich nor extremely poor.
 It may also rule out the conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't
 have anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to
 leave anyone behind).
 With a general view of conscpicuous consumption, one could argue that even
 the poorest may want to indicate that they are not the poorest - much the
 way richest may want it to be known to the others that they are indeed
 the richest

 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 may in fact be needed by both the rich and the poor.

 getting poorer and try to become the richest at all times.

By considering the asset hierarchies and the competition, we consider to
 varied opportunities between social groups.
 We believe that the differences in classes and occupations are not merely
 of wealth - but of future perceptions and realisations of wealth changes
 (i.e.
 both special and general probabilities).
 Karelis talks about this.
 There is another complication to the model that we consider.
 It is that the extreme differences are not sustainable if the consumers
 have to survive.
 This is because compassion and conflict also exist aside with competition.
 The qualities of compassion may co-exist with qualities of segregation
 - the rich and poor both may want an exchange where the rich can be compassiona
te and the poor needy but respectful and optimistic (see Karelis).
 The consumption itself has qualities of segregation in the sense that it
 creates needs that won't be fulfilled in the poorer group- so the segregation
 stabilises.

JUST INTUITIVELY, we should also be clear about why risk-seeking and risk-averse

 high probability) - the poor risk-seeking class and vs high-alpha (overvalue
 high-probability - assuming it to be certain and undervaluing low-probability)
 - the rich class (not necessarily risk-averse).
 These are characteristics are more likely to depend on social factors other
 than the starting point of wealth differences - which matter less when
 the needs have been addressed (see other chapter where we discuss about
 extreme wealth differences).
 Risk preferences are more sticky (stable) and related to occupation and
 structures.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up, our approach to status consumption is similar in many ways to
 the one adopted in many recent studies on visible consumption - as it views
 a consumer's net utility from status consumption as a combination of private
 utility (subjective) and public utility (observed through rise in wealth).
 Where it differs fundamentally is in its treatment of uncertainty - establishin
g a relationship between the extreme wealth differences and the upside risk
 with consumption.
 Formulating status consumption as uncertainty associated with the future
 states of wealth and the utility from status consumption as a probabilistic
 private utility, we use prospect theory (PT) to understand a competition
 for status.
 A key difference from the approach taken in much of the literature on visible
 consumption is therefore that the status utility from such consumption
 is not futile in a material sense - a luxury watch may be futile for private
 use by itself (when compared to its cheaper alternatives that offer the
 same functionality i.e.
 that of telling the current time) but if an aspiring businessman uses his
 knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business, then
 the futile consumption may probabilistically translate into a material
 advantage.
 The promise of social mobility is indeed the core appeal of status consumption.
 Items like luxury watches are in fact important only because the rich flock
 around them 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Indeed if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile - a non-materialist sense that our model is not concerned with.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We thus argue that the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may
 offer is important to the consumer as it acts as a means of connecting
 the rich with the not-so rich in the long-term.
 Further, the consumption of status item is driven by a small chance of
 success - a probability which the risk-seeking (risk-averse) consumer is
 likely to overestimate (underestimate).
 In the long-term one must reconcile the subjective probabilities with an
 observed wealth process - as only a few of the purchasers of luxury watches
 would improve their self-image and enhance their social networks to achieve
 material wealth - others would remain mere purchasers.

A savings or growth rate and a depreciation rate are often used in the discounti
ng intertemporal model of a typical savings and consumption substitution
 problem.
 We refrain from this approach due to the inherent assumptions they make
 about the consumer behaviour.
 The arguments for impatience among consumers and opportunities in nature
 from the past centuries - that the ideas of depreciation and growth-rates
 rely upon - have in fact undergone significant revisions (see Fisher

 Thus instead of using a model for discounting where certain and uncertain
 parts of consumption may be discounted at different rates (see for example
 Cagetti
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CagettiWealth2003"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 where discounting rates are associated education and other demographic
 variables) , we view the competition for status between two consumers in
 a stochastic setting where the consumers differ both in their starting
 wealth and risk-aversion levels.
 We believe that the subjective and observed uncertainties which both determine
 the consumer's behaviour in the stochastic framework better represent the
 needs for status than a model where depreciation or growth for wealth are
 known to the consumer (see Shefrin-Thaler
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this stochastic framework, the two consumers compete for relative advantage
 in wealth (assets).
 While the relative advantage in wealth does constitute status, the evaluation
 of risks associated with future wealth also affects their own evaluation
 of status and influence the intertemporal choice.
 In a given period, therefore, the consumer can either spend a certain amount
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a risky position or save towards the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we assume no natural depreciation of wealth is assumed, a reduction
 in wealth is only possible through direct expenditure - which in turns
 constitutes only of consumption (as part of a cost of owning assets 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(A)$
\end_inset

 for assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 Contrasting with a growth and depreciation approach, the wealthier of the
 two consumers in the model does not silently earn interest on income -
 but instead competes with the other(s) who could acquire new wealth by
 investing (
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

) into newer areas.
 To further one's wealth, the richer consumer has no choice but to bet on
 uncertain pursuits in order to grow her wealth as she competes with the
 poorer consumer while guarding her current (wealthier) status

 Since the subjective risk the consumer is willing to take towards her future

 However, this is not to say we may identify a risk-seeking or risk-averse
 archetypes of consumers that is more likely to spend on status consumption.
 Such a claim would carry the same error that was made in the earlier depreciati
on-growth based theories.
 A consumer who is risk-seeking in one area could in fact be risk-averse
 in some other area.
 The utility of the stochastic model is only in pointing that expenditure
 towards status consumption is subject to the dynamics of uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Uncertainty in future wealth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the properties of a discrete stochastic process for consumer
 wealth with the first (observed) uncertainty.
 The first property of such a process is its detachment from consumer perception
s.
 A process for wealth that pays off for risky investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is meant to represent the externalities in income differences that are
 unrelated with the relative social positioning of two consumers.
 Thus the risk-rewarding process is one that does not favor the rich consumer
 over the poor consumer.
 The process is unaware of whether an investment (effort) 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 was made by the consumer 1 or consumer 2.
 Instead of the income or wealth of the consumer, the process must depend
 on a resource or attribute that is independent of the characteristics of
 the consumer.
 We allow this risk-returns process to depend explicitly on the past efforts
 made by either of the consumers.
 This is similar to the finiteness constraints of resources in an economy
 where the rewards for risks.
 The finiteness is assumed known to the participating consumers in the economy
 and therefore both the consumers make decisions knowing that i) an infinite
 effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 does not provide infinite wealth and ii) the opportunities would eventually
 dry up regardless of who puts up a higher effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 .
 However, due to the uncertainty in the process of wealth, the consumers
 don't know exactly when the opportunities would dry and can only make a
 decision based on their estimate - subject to the second (subjective) uncertain
ty.
 The consumer's choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is therefore myopic with respect to the long-term changes in the wealth
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus for investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}(t)$

 by the two consumers in a period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 of reward for effort at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would depend on the past values 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k<t}(\psi_{1}(k)+\psi_{2}(k))$
\end_inset

 .
 The second property of such a process is due to boundedness of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

.
 For an equilibrium between the consumers with different risk-aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 (or a strategy for future values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 must be bounded with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The boundedness condition does not mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 must decline to 0 for there to be an equilibrium - only that the payoff
 from risk-taking cannot indefinitely increase with marginal effort.
 A steady state would be achieved if the returns to risk rose with effort
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (or if 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 evolved as part of another stochastic process) just the same.
 Note also that since the process for wealth is not subject to the competitions
 amongst the consumers, its rises and declines are not predictable by the
 myopic consumers.
 So while the consumers may be aware of being in a regime of rise or decline
 of returns with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

, they have neither control nor foresight of when the regimes could end
 or switch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real world, a rising 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 may correspond to situations where where crowding effects create more opportuni
ties for wealth.
 Similarly, decline in 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 represents situations where resources may be subject to an eventual depletion
 (e.g.
 land, forests, natural resources etc.).
 To explain the mechanics of this process and the risk-perception of consumers,
 let's consider an analogy of two-consumer gold-rush economy where more
 digging efforts increase the chances of obtaining higher wealth for either
 of the consumer.
 We ignore the life-cycle effects by assuming that consumers are dynasties.
 The search for mining opportunities is the only way of finding new wealth
 in two-consumer economy.
 Since luck clearly favours the hard-working in this gold-rush economy,
 the random process of wealth thus does not favour either consumer as it
 rewards anyone with effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 (which may decline or rise without the knowledge of the consumers).
 The randomness in the wealth process means that while the consumers are
 aware of the finiteness of gold deposits, they can only guess when the
 last gold-mine would be found.
 Further they are myopic in the sense that their efforts change often times
 before the goldmines would eventually deplete.
 While the consumers may know of the finiteness of gold resources at all
 times, they can only adjust their projections based on the declining returns
 from efforts (corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

) rather than influencing the process of wealth in any way.
 Further, no inherent depreciation for wealth means that an immense wealth
 could deplete quickly with a high rate of consumption (corresponding to
 costs of assets acquired 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(A)$
\end_inset

 or the effort 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this analogy of a gold-rush economy, status consumption could appear
 futile when all the wealth is tied to more mining.
 But since superficial attachments are all what it takes to spur status
 competitions, one only needs the participants to attach a value to their
 beliefs of projected wealth for status to relevant in the economy.
 Status consumption could thus serve a purpose in this model if the consumer's
 knowledge of each others' subjective evaluation of the future wealth isn't
 complete and changeable.
 In other words, if the wealth process (e.g.
 the set of gold mines in our analogy) was believed to be as fair as the
 flip of a coin, then there would be no inference of status and no investment
 towards achieving it.
 But if the perceptions arising out of wealth differences do not exhibit
 a fairness or symmetry of information among the consumers and if risk-aversion
 levels influence one's long-term growth in wealth, then a market for perception
s is unavoidable.

ion levels (e.g.
 buy protection against it falling or rising to an undesired level), then
 a market for status consumption is implied.
 As a market of experiences, status goods provide either an expectation
 of projected wealth or the knowledge of the expectation to the consumer
 - thereby either boosting her self-image or controlling her long-term risk-aver
sion.

 To formalise the stochastic setting for the consumer expectation, we first
 assume that wealth process scales up the probability of income gain from
 the risky investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 so that an income 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is rewarded to the consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 .
 Here,
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a random variable observed in the economy and the diminishing returns
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\psi)$
\end_inset

 are only through combined 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}(t)+\psi_{2}(t)$
\end_inset

).
 In the gold-rush analogy, digging more mines cannot infinitely increase
 one's wealth at a non-decreasing rate and therefore it does not pay off
 to put infinite sized bets on 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In the Monte Carlo simulations we use to study consumer behaviour with
 a PT-like utility, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 as Bernoulli trials.
  Assuming a scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 that controls the size of payoff, the two consumers could be said to observe
 a common process of wealth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
A_{t+1}-A_{t} & =-\psi+R\sigma(\psi)X_{t}\label{eq:Bernoulli_dynamics}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summing over, one could write:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
A_{T} & =A_{0}-\psi T+R\sigma(\psi)\sum_{t=1}^{T}X_{t}

Assuming that both consumer have the same time horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in mind, they would choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 so that they each have non-zero wealth until time-horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The long-term horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be long enough for the consumers to fall back upon sheer
 luck after it.
 Since consumer choices are in response to random process, either consumer
 could run out wealth much before the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 stabilises

The introduction of credit for a consumer once her disposable income dries
 out is not different from starting with a different wealth.
 In other words, providing a credit line to a consumer amounts to starting
 the evolution of wealth with a different (lower or higher) initial income
 for the two consumers.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Such a depletion of one's disposable income which risky investments are
 paid out from would be further exacerbated if we introduce an asset costs
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 (corresponding to the costs which the owned assets bear in the real-world).
 In fact the wealth is guaranteed to decline to zero eventually if there
 is no return from the investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 goes close to 0) 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The needs of the consumer (adjusted for wealth as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(A)$
\end_inset

) do not - by definition - offer any status advantage to either of the consumers.
 The cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(A)$
\end_inset

 also implies that no one forgoes their needs to take risk since the needs
 of the consumer are meant to grow as her wealth levels rise (due to costs
 of labour, upkeep and maintenance etc.)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Exhaustion of disposable income could also justify a redistribution from
 the richer consumers that would ensue in an extremely unequal setting (i.e.
 if difference in values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 is too much).
 Such a redistribution would influence both the equilibrium conditions and
 the expectations of future-risk aversion.
 Considering both asset costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 and a taxation rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, we can write.

Utility Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our interpretation of status is not different from the conventional view
 as the combination of (high) net-worth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 of an individual and the high likelihood of her staying rich in the long-term.
 The model only interprets the sense of status in a stochastic setting where
 both risk and value bring utility to the participating consumers.
 More particularly, both reference-point for wealth and the loss-aversion
 to it matter to the consumer's view of relative wealth.
 Such utility function cannot therefore depend only on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a given period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (and projections from future times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau>t$
\end_inset

), but also the investment 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the consumer sets in response to perception of future risk with projected
 value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 The approaches where only value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 or utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{t+1})$
\end_inset

 is optimised by the consumer are thus rejected in favour of an approach
 where both probability of a certain wealth level and the wealth level itself
 are considered
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To see the limitations of such an approach, consider where 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{t+1})$
\end_inset

 under a few risk-aversion parameters (see Sharpe 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for example).
 Here, a risk neutral consumer is one chooses a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{CE}$
\end_inset

 with uncertainty imposed by 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t\in[1,T]}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{CE}))=u(A_{CE})$

 The consumer who chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E($

\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T}))>E(u(A_{CE}))$
\end_inset

 is considered risk-seeking and the consumer who selects 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))<E(u(A_{CE}))$
\end_inset

 would be considered risk-averse.
 With a CRRA utility for example, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A)=\frac{A^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E(u(A_{T}))$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 leading to 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 being maximised when 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 is maximised i.e.

 The measure of risk-aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 in the CRRA function is essentially a measure of the curvature of a value
 function.
 What this means in the stochastic setting is that if every consumer optimises
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{T})$
\end_inset

 then consumer has no reason to deviate from the maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A_{T})$

 There is very little descriptive significance for such theories in the

 A desirable property of the dynamics in Equation

 is that the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 under a perceived uncertainty is controlled only through consumption (or
 investments 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 if costs of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are fixed) by the consumer.
 As wealth declines only through consumption (risk) and the consumption
 (risk taken) is fully under control of the consumer, the decision of an
 optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\psi^{*}$
\end_inset

s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\psi)$
\end_inset

 is minimised) depends both on the time-horizons considered by the consumer
 and the probability weight function 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\alpha}(p)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have noted before, the consumers have no way of predicting the decline
 or rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 in the long-term and they are assumed to act upon the current value of
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

 in making decisions towards the risky allocation 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)$
\end_inset

.
 The cost of owning assets 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(A)$
\end_inset

 and rates of taxation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 are held constant in the consumer's projections.
 Further, in the absence of an exchange of information, the consumers can
 make no assumption about how risk-averse the consumer may be in the long-term.
 A possible exchange that would help a consumer decide a strategy towards
 choosing her own 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 would be discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Dynamic-Reference-Points"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 but in the absence of such a exchange, we can view the consumer's intertemporal
 choice as a simple lottery scheme - so that a future projected values 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau>t}$
\end_inset

 is weighted with a probability weighting function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SanjitDhamiBehavioural2016,KarmakarSWU1978"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Thus the set of possible 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to a set of lotteries evaluated by the consumer based on
 her own risk-aversion level 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 - which defines the probability weighting function.
 In a real-world example, the various lotteries available to the consumer
 could range from a secure cash savings to a balanced strategy of spending
 towards education in the hope for income rise over years or a bet on an
 expensive club membership in a hope for relevant social connections - all
 with varying levels of risk so that a consumer's own risk-preference always
 influences the selection of a particular lottery.
 The Equations

[Risk-aversion levels matter for a common reference] In an environment where
 rates of success rise, a wealthy risk-seeker would be in a better situation
 than if she were risk-averse.
 Similarly, with declining rates of success, the richer risk-averse consumer
 would become richer while poorer risk-seeker becomes poorer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[2-dimensional-reference-level] If we assume that a consumer might want
 to change make up her own mind about the future, then she would evaluate
 her long-term expectations and indicate that through status consumption.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 cannot be changed as frequently as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and is therefore sticky in the sense.
 If the consumer could adjust her risk-aversion levels like 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 in a long period (in a more realistic example occupational choices or education
 are some long-term choices that would influence the consumer's long-term
 perceptions of risk and the reference level), one's risk-aversion level
 becomes a part of consumer choice.
 In terms of the anticipatory model proposed by Koszegi, this is akin to
 a consumer choosing her own reference point.
 By making a long-term choice on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, the consumer is effectively choosing a reference point relative to which
 her expectations for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 would be formed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the consumer is free to choose long-term reference level, then she could

's variation with 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(\Delta A,p)$
\end_inset

 If we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 depends only on

 One consequence of

 more risk-taking than she otherwise would be).
  Wealth-differences are more visible than risk perceptions - but that's
 not how status consumption matters in the model.
 That's where status consumption - a statement of power - ensures that the
 the consumer would dominate the other person's alpha - either by giving
 it higher confidence or reluctance.

[power of status consumption] The status consumption is a market of experiences.
 Persuasion is a power in this subjective plane.
 Through acquiring habits, taste and identity - which provide a security
 to the consumer (pulling her up when she is falling in an unfavourable
 direction) - a consumer who is risk-averse towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 (i.e.

would make someone else more risk-averse (?) 
\bar default
because the other person would acquire their tastes believeing that their
 lucks are associated with the level of risk-aversion (similarly the risk-seekin
g makes others more risk-seeking).
 The poor can benefit from knowing of the true risks of being wealthy and
 might want to indicate their interest or disinterest in wealth (with consumptio
n - that marks status within their own reference).
 While status consumption is always tied to one's own reference level, it
 always represents a long-term protective (imaginary) asset (hope-against-hope)
 to create a favourable risk-aversion level in untoward circumstances.
 Status consumption costs something.
 By investing in it, the risk-averse loser lowers her alpha (bandwagon)
 and the risk-seeking loser increases her alpha (snob).
 It doesn't influence the other but only improves oneself.
 Status consumption is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which offers good habits to the loser (if she is already a loser) it makes
 sense - but even when somebody is a winner it offers a protection - for
 the long-term.
 The status consumption can thus provide the consumer a security that is
 not part of natural process - by reassuring the consumer that the other
 consumer would not put herself in an environment too far away from her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Two period model] The consumer not want to be too risk-averse in an environment
 where being risk-seeking awards more (by being on a bandwagon) and she
 would avoid being risk-seeking in an environment where being risk-averse
 might make oneself better off (using snob consumption).
 Status consumption offers a protection to the consumer by letting her know
 that she has a favourable risk-level.
 The knowledge that the other individual would always a risk-aversion higher
 or lower than oneself is of value to the consumer in a zero-sum game.
 The consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

 emotions framework proposed by Koszegi
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoszegiAnticipationPersonalEqlb2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to understand how the consumer may choose status consumption.
 Due to the value the consumer attaches to risky investments (e.g.
 on education and lifestyle), the consumer must make a choice by assuming
 a certain behaviour by the other consumer.
 This is how she chooses a certain function 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(\Delta A,p)$
\end_inset

.
 Being risk-seeking provide higher relative wealth when the return for risk
 is high enough and the other consumer makes lesser effort.
 On the other hand, it pays off to be risk-averse if 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is too low.
 Therefore the consumer would switch to being risk-averse only if she is
 confident that p is not enough for the other consumer to close the wealth
 gap.
 Let’s say that the consumer works based on the expected time until when
 the other consumer would close the wealth gap – an expected value that
 would decrease as the p goes up or the other consumer becomes more risk-seeking.
 The poor consumer has no option to switch to being risk-averse except when
 the finding rate is too low (and being risk-seeking would hurt) and/or
 when there is taxation.
 Otherwise, extreme loss aversion would mean that she would take whatever
 risk there is to take.
 Given that the consumer gains more in sufficiently near term by risk-seeking,
 the consumer would only know in the long-term period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 that she needs to be more risk-seeking or less.
 She finds that she has too little or too high aversion or propensity for
 risk only after realising a loss at time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The expected values at times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<T$

[Value of Status Consumption]

Even outside the two consumer model, the market for status consumption is
 essentially a market of experiences and these are experiences are used
 to connect individuals of varied risk and wealth configurations.
 Status consumption is used to distill away those with less wealth or with
 unfavourable risk-attitudes.

 A fair value of private club memberships or an expertise in conspicuous
 items (watches, cars etc.) which may eventually get the consumer in the

A monetary value for status consumption in the framework is simply the average
 loss incurred by her when she make her choice on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 (over a given time-horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

) in the absence of the knowledge of the other consumer risk-aversion.
 In the gold-rush analogy, status consumption would be equivalent to a signal
 that indicates a higher subjective likelihood of finding gold in the future
 for both the consumers.
 A consumer who can let both herself and the other consumer believe that
 is she is poised to find the next big mine with much higher wealth levels
 than their current fortunes would carry a higher status (regardless of
 whether she is the richer consumer or not).
 Equivalently, a consumer may lose her status not simply due to direct wealth
 loss but through a disbelief in her future prospects alone.
 Status consumption provides the security of a shared belief to either of
 consumers and thus even though as a signal of projected wealth it may have
 no value by itself (it always requires labor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 to retrieve more gold), it may carry a value to the consumer since it improves
 one's risk-seeking behaviour in the desired direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Stability: TAXES and ASSET-COSTS] The above dynamics would imply that asset
 differences would be much higher than their starting points if a risk-taking
 consumer gets richer and the opportunities to gain mobility (return from
 the wealth process) dry up – leaving no chance for the poorer consumer
 to participate in the wealth game.
 To reduce final wealth differences and to leave the game in a state ripe
 enough until a natural process reinvigorates with more wealth, a taxation
 rate provides an additional control to the wealth differences in the wealth
 game.
 Such taxation pressures would increase or decrease with asset differences
 in the final states.
 We view the taxation policy simply as a means to transfer a proportion
 of wealth differences from the richer consumer to the poor consumer.
 The tax rates remain constant throughout and their effect on the future
 income are known to the consumer.
 The above model to understand how taxation would influence status consumption
 in a rising and declining economy.
 The stability of the model is merely the point where the consumers have
 run out of risk-taking opportunities – as their disposable income would
 approach near zero as the wealth opportunities dry out – or reaches a level
 where expected rise in income equals 0 (or the costs of assets in a non-zero
 asset costs model).
 In other word, the equilibrium state of the model is arrived at when costs
 balance the future expectation of income (wealth changes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Takeaways] Instead of assuming wealth-differences we also focus on how
 the relevance of the knowledge of future across social sections could influence
 consumption more than the asset difference and income.This offers three
 advantages that are of value towards the normative theory for status consumptio
n.
 First, we can interpret a true value of status consumption.
 Whether the consumer perceptions are out of touch with reality or not is
 a quantiative measure of how futile status consumption might relatively
 in disparate economies - say in the developing and the developed world.
 Secondly, we understand quantitatively what how taxation could cause the
 create pressures on status consumption under rising and declining regimes
 - which is particularly appealing since the latter are of less importance
 in subjective.
 The model allows us to do that because we assume that uncertainties at
 long-term are usually controlled by more.
 Thirdly, social privileges also matter in this model as someone who can
 always ensure

Conclusions

\begin_layout Standard
[Main Conclusion] The model interprets the relevance of local reference
 points as the personal equilibirum of consumers.

 than many of the models we've used.The roots of subjective inference lie

 Despite carrying the same

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 significance, the very presence of social hierarchy means that the individuals
 would associate a higher subjective probability with a certain characteristics
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - by considering individuals with the same characteristics 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a private sense.
 Such preferences are hardly anomalies but reflect a long-term security
 perceived by individuals that they associate with characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 A desirable feature of the above framework is that it also endogenises
 social characteristics vector as the consumer's notion of subjectivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[CYCLES IN ECONOMY] As such, the inheritable wealth would decline in value
 when it's not invested in any growing economy.
 In a declining economy (consider depletion of gold in our example), even
 though wealth may depreciate slower it would still keep the consumer's
 relative advantage to others and the consumers would continue to form an
 expectation of increased future wealth just the same.
 It can be argued that wealth in the economy is important not only because
 of the purchasing power but fundamentally due to the social order in the
 form of an expectation held by other participants in the economy that they
 can replicate the success of the wealthy by acting as participants in the
 economy 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the presence of social stratification, such expectations would be segmented
 across social groups.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The nature of the distribution would thus be independent of the state of
 the economy.
 For example, the model may allow us to compare status consumption in a
 developed economy with that in a developing economy.
 From the point of view of the consumer's perception of risk - which the
 model incorporates - the most relevant difference between the developing
 countries and the developed countries is that of the strength of welfare
 institutions.
 In a developed economy, the state institutions intervene when market forces
 aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertakings or to distribut
e items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world - often failing to provide incentives to the private enterprise
 for distribution of public goods.
 The differences that the levels of uncertainty at local levels cause could
 explain the varied context of status consumption.
 When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 This has implications for status consumption.
 Consider basic education - which may be of status importance in the developing
 economy in a way that it isn't in the developed economy.
 This is primarily because the distribution of education (and other similar
 assets that may be public goods) is state-assisted in a developed country
 and the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny is lowered.
 Thus, the extent to which education may eventually matter towards status
 in the developed economy depends on how consumers set themselves apart
 in the social order based on other means of signaling status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), the expected growth
 from education is higher (observed probability).
