\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is derived based on the framework for intertempor
al consumption choice.
 Status is endogenised as states of financial stability and included as
 part of the consumer's utility in a model where the consumer balances her
 needs for quality in the present with the potential of higher status (state)
 through savings for assets in the future.
 Theoretical and numerical solutions are discussed before estimation of
 the model from the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata (years 2010, 2012
 and 2014).
 Possible refinements of the model for decision under uncertainty are discussed.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a conventional analysis of demand, one uses the prices and quantities
 observed of the items to understand the relative importance of commodities
 with respect to each other.
 The demand for individual goods is often aggregated into commodities to
 compare the demand with its past values or values in a different population
 - thus providing a sense of quality for a particular commodity.
 Viewing status consumption as an instance of high-quality consumption,
 if one were to use the measures of quality from the demand literature to
 measure status-related consumption, a detailed set of market prices of
 the goods within every commodity would be needed.
 The data on market prices is hardly available at local levels in most consumer
 surveys - compelling us to use the so-called hedonic approach - arguing
 that the characteristics of the commodity are what consumers evaluate in
 forms of price.
 While demand literature often uses market characteristics or shadow prices
 for such analyses of quality for a particular commodity, the studies on
 conspicuous consumption tend to explore a specific instance of status consumpti
on instead.
 Here, conspicuous consumption is expected to occur through a certain type
 of (visible) goods that are meant to be futile for the general needs of
 the consumer.
 This assumption allows us to use to the separability of demand for visible
 goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to extend the concept of visible consumption in the developing
 economies, we use the framework of demand analysis arguing that the framework
 could explain status consumption in a more general context.
 While such a model might not benefit from the tractability that the models
 for visible consumption benefit from, the estimates of wealth of the consumer
 (e.g.
 asset ownership in consumer data), if available, may allow us to observe
 how quality across commodities is consumed with respect to the wealth of
 the consumer.
 A general sense of status consumption - as we argue - must come from a
 combination of higher quality across commodities and a stable ownership
 of wealth or assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To elaborate the model, we enhance the framework for intertemporal consumer
 choice by adding long-term incentives and near-term demand for quality.
 In what could be seen as an attempt to refine the permanent income approach
 (which vigorously ignores all non-monetary wealth), we model the consumption
 on quality as sensitive to the perception of how (subjectively) probable
 a future state of financial security is to a consumer.
 In doing so, we use the assets (durable items) owned as an indicator of
 wealth (also because the data available on income may be poor in economies
 with a significant informal sector) and the high quality commodities as
 the consumer's attempt to improve one's perceived status.
 Arguing that consumption is myopic and depends on the perception of status
 in a near-term while savings are cumulative in an intertemporal model for
 consumer choice, we let the representative consumer in the model optimise
 utility inclusive of status - which is obtained by owned assets (including
 skills and characteristics that are acquired over multiple generations)
 and the quality of consumption.
 Arguing that the signalling benefit a consumer derives from consumption
 - in any sense - must come out of either high-priced non-durable consumption
 or long-term durable consumption, we view the signaling as the utility
 obtained from the consumption of quality and owned assets over time.
 Taking an approach different from the PIH, we consider how types of non-monetar
y wealth may matter towards the perception of risk (monetary or non-monetary)
 and attempt to relate the substitution between saving for assets and consumptio
n of quality in the life-time of the consumer to the long-term growth in
 the consumer's material wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key variables that the econometric analyses are concerned with are i)
 the extent to which the consumers maintain their habits of purchasing quality
 ii) the extent to which they choose to save for future assets rather than
 to overspend on higher quality in the current time period (measured simply
 as the distance - in monetary terms - from the cost of basic needs) and
 lastly iii) a measure of basic needs themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consideration of the cost of assets available to the consumer is of particular
 interest if we wish to compare status-related consumption in two economies
 with disparate levels of economic development (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy).
 The distribution of assets - which may vary significantly in a developing
 economy from the distribution in a developed economy - provide us a way
 to compare the contexts of status consumption in the two economies.
 For a set of assets (long-term durable goods) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

 ordered by increasing cost, the difference in successive costs i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta d_{j}=d_{j}-d_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}\in\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}<d_{j}\forall(i<j)$
\end_inset

 may be much higher relative to the cost of quality consumption in one economy
 relative to that in the other.
 These may have disparate effects on consumer choice in the two economies
 as the costlier long-term assets may discourage savings for the future
 (the consumer may give up hopes of acquiring assets if she is to remain
 in a low income group relative to asset costs) and the perceptions of high
 mobility may encourage the consumer to overspend on quality in the short-term
 (matching one's consumption to one's perceived status).
 As assets have a more definite impact on the consumer's secure long-term
 growth (assets being a stronger indicator the stability of her income),
 in equilibrium, the consumer would balance the more uncertain perception
 of her status with the more certain expected value of savings in her lifetime.
 Thus if income is assumed to follow a process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer spending on her needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is known, then observing the proportion of consumer's spending on quality
 (which also determines the savings rate for durable goods in the intertemporal
 settings due to the total income constraint) with respect to the measures
 of wealth can help us comment on the contexts of status consumption in
 the two economies.
 This we believe is key to understanding status consumption across economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the specification of an intertemporal model for status consumption, we
 relate the spending on quality and on assets to two different uncertainties.
 The probability associated with the first uncertainty is due to the subjective
 view of the consumer of her own future states of wealth.
 The probability functions corresponding to the consumer's perceptions that
 match their expenditures on quality (i.e.
 the first uncertainty) are fundamentally guesses and may be subject to
 socio-political conditions more rather the long-term economic concerns.
 The subjective probabilities of the consumer however need to be coherent
 with the economy's long-term growth which is associated with the second
 uncertainty in the model.
 In a limited context of the current chapter, we provide a non-stochastic
 model defining the parameters in the Euler Equation for asset growth that
 are controlled by the consumer.
 In the basic model we provide in the chapter, an exogenous non- stochastic
 process for income is specified\SpecialChar endofsentence
 The econometric methods are then derived
 based on the intertemporal model extended for quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, we attempt to view status-related consumption in a conventional
 model for consumer demand - using the availability of asset costs in an
 economy and a definition of quality.
 We justify an interpretation of status consumption from quality and assets
 based on the assertion that for a rational consumer to spend on status
 consumption, she must see some status utility from consumption in the long-term
 or the short-term.
 As the goal of separating oneself from others through consumption (when
 all else fails) is effectively to minimise one's own perceived risk (if
 not the actual risk) of departure from the high-income group, status consumptio
n is likely to exist for every consumer in an economy where social stratificatio
n exists - thus generalising our model for status consumption across all
 consumers.
 Based on this model for status, we can argue that the consumer's focus
 on consumption may be more pronounced in societies undergoing economic
 upheavals (e.g.
 introduction to global markets, industrialisation), where the poorer social
 identities may try to cross previously imposed barriers through consumption
 (through a bandwagon effect) while those with richer social identities
 attempt to guard their status through consumption (a snob effect).
 To compare the status consumption in any two countries using our model,
 we seek econometric methods relying on parameters measuring consumer behaviour
 that are invariant with respect to the macroeconomic differences in the
 two respective economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the discussions related to the specification of a model, we have made
 a conscious attempt to not take an ideological stance on whether status
 consumption is wasteful or a necessary artifact of the belief in social
 mobility.
 Thus instead of claiming whether status shows the consumers' long-termism
 or their short-termism, ours is merely an attempt to endogenise the role
 that social identities, long-term asset ownership and other types of wealth
 may play in consumption - particularly since we wish to seek a framework
 general enough to be used to test the existence of status consumption in
 the developing countries.
 The econometric methods that we have developed, interpret quality as the
 distance of expensive nondurable consumption from the minimum cost of needs
 and use the model assumption that any status value in the short-run can
 only be achieved through relative quality of consumption.
 The two primary goals that we wish to accomplish with the particular model
 for status consumption - are i) to test whether the preference for quality
 increases with rise in income and urbanisation (indicated by the expansion
 of consumer basket) and ii) to see if preferences for quality change across
 populations segregated through levels of development, economic strata or
 social identities within an economy.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advancements of the last century in game theory and statistics have
 made us revisit many of Veblen's observations in more precise and quantitative
 terms - allowing us to interpret his early observations on the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour with a framework for decision under
 risk.
 An understanding of the effect that human behaviour and social conditions
 have on a macroscopic level may still be far from complete
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"

\end_inset

, but the framework for decision under risk could be used to understand
 status-related consumption.
 There are two threads in the literature that we find promising in this
 regard.
 The first is that of habit formation amongst consumers and the second on
 the relevance of social identities in visible consumption.
 We believe that a framework of decision under risk should allow us to link
 the two threads in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature from behavioural economics, marketing research and development
 economics all seem to concur on the tendencies of habit formation in consumer
 behaviour.
 The measurement of changes in habits and quality has a long tradition in
 neoclassical economics (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment of the problem).
 Of particular interest is the model for myopia amongst consumers described
 by Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who notes the significance of lagged consumption on aggregate consumption.
 The life-cycle model used by Muellbauer has been of considerable importance
 in more recent studies on consumption where a rational utility-optimising
 consumer balances between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned savings over her life-time i.e.
 in an intertemporal substitution setting (a problem often treated equivalent
 to the classical utility maximising consumption problem).
 Improving upon the classical approach where the consumer is subservient
 to her optimised plan for life-time savings and consumption, a few behavioural
 approaches (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for example) have sought descriptive models for mental accounting and factors
 such as willpower to better understand the development of habits in consumers.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice, the
 representative consumer in such models is subject to overeating, overspending,
 accumulating items she doesn't need or acquiring habits she cannot afford.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thread of literature on consumption that is more empirical in nature
 has observed how social identities play a role in status-signalling.
 Empirical studies in both the developed world and the developing countries
 find social group identities relevant to status-related consumption (see

 We believe that a behavioural model - if used with justified reference
 points (see Markowitz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MarkowitzUtil1952"

\end_inset

) for status-related consumption - should connect the two threads and provide
 a better understanding of conspicuous consumption with the theory of decision-m
aking under risk.

A general approach that can help incorporate social order in consumption

 With a framework of social ranking and signaling therewith, Robert Frank

 for example, finds that signaling needs become more important amongst the
 lower economic strata when they are huddled in the overpopulated suburban

 present evidence that the conspicuous consumption for consumers in S Africa
 is relative to lower or similar income-groups (rather than relative to
 higher income groups) .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the instances of status consumption under several cultural contexts
 seem to have a common theme of expenditure on signaling items - there may
 be a need to tread with caution when looking at demand of items in the
 developing countries that are considered conspicuous in the developed countries.
 This is because the relative wealth differences may be more relevant for
 status differences in the developing countries.
 The wealth differences being much larger and the industrial development
 much more concentrated in a developing country, the glaringly visible and
 sufficiently local (dense) wealth differences may have far more weight
 than the limited range of status items that a rational consumer may purchase
 (see Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for criticism of a 
\shape italic
belle epoque 
\shape default
view of status consumption).
 On the other hand, rapid industrialisation and a transformation of consumer
 markets in many developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as Asia
 may result in both a narrowing of income differences (or expansion of industria
l sector) and the introduction of items for status-related consumption significa
nt enough to make Veblen's ostensibly dated insights on status relevant
 in the context of the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sociological studies have long indicated the role that industrial goods
 and income rises play in addressing of status needs by the consumers (see
 Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 , Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 ).
 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SrinivasSanskritization"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 noted an instance of Veblen's pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 (referred to as 
\shape italic
Sanskritization
\shape default
) as the erstwhile lower classes emulated the habits of higher social classes
 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, the habits of the upper economic classes were similarly
 observed to have expanded to the middle and lower classes in the decades
 after the second world war.
 In the post-feudal societies all over the world where consumer markets
 have developed, a new working class seems to have replaced the feudal or
 colonial order of the century before - attempting to emulate the former's
 behaviour.
 Still, while this setting is not unrelated to the one that Veblen had described
 in his treatise on conscpicuous consumption, there are many ways in which
 the context of the sub-Saharan African context is different from the American
 gilded age.
 One may find therefore that the status consumption in the developing countries
 in large part is merely an indication of wealth (see Khamis et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ZahraIndia"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The questions in the consumer survey (which is how a researcher may obtain
 the list of visible items) may need to be adjusted to include items that
 may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A model of the particular conditions of the post-war developments that would
 consider the much higher levels of industrialisation and population growth
 since the last century - is probably key to understanding how the consumption
 is fundamentally different in our times.
 A model reflecting such conditions that has been of significant interest
 in the development economics literature is the Harris Todaro model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GollinLRF,HarrisTodaro1970"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 - which focuses on the urban and rural interactions in the developing countries
 while relating income differences with the consumer's uncertainty.
 The represenative consumer in the model (a worker/farmer) is meant to maximise
 her income and reduce the risk associated with it as she is faced with
 the choice of migration to the urban areas.
 To include relative income and wealth concerns in order to incorporate
 status-related consumption, one could enhance the model by refining the
 migration incentives including goals of consumption with associated uncertainti
es.
 After all, a flight to urban areas may not be merely an escape from despondent
 circumstances but also serve as an entry to the expanded urban consumption
 basket and a (perceived) promise of social mobility - incentives that are
 of importance in any group behaviour.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approaches considering peer effects - more particularly seeking a reference
 point for consumption - have also been of interest in the literature on
 developing economics.
 One example is the Indian food budget squeeze (where per capita calorie
 intake seems to have declined as per capita income has increased) - which
 Sen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sen2005Calories,DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 has attributed to the rise in the poverty-level for consumption of non-food
 items.
 More recently, Chai et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 have used peer-effects approach to inspect the consumption on signaling
 items.
 In Sen view or in a general model considering long-term choices (e.g.
 migration, ownership of a house etc.) with the relative consumption of quality,
 a reference point separating basic needs from luxury or high-quality consumptio
n becomes a necessity.
 One issue with the task of setting such a reference point is that the consumpti
on microdata where such a reference point should be set is generally far
 coarser and sparser than the data from a lab experiment (where setting
 a reference point separating risk-seeking behaviours from risk-averse behaviour
s is relatively easier)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is not to say that a behavioural experiment cannot emulate the conditions
 faced by a consumer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Another issue in the surveys from the developing economies that is of a
 more serious concern is that the income data itself may be of poor quality
 - owing to the presence of a large informal sector and the significance
 of barter arrangements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the developed economies where income inequalities are less of a concern
 and data on income is generally more reliable, it is often possible to
 separate the bare necessities from the luxuries to identify status consumption.
 Focusing on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption in the regions of erstwhile East and West Germany after the
 economic liberalisation at the end of cold war, for example, Friehe et
 al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrieheGermany"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 have explored if prolonged measures of income equality can influence conspicuou
s consumption asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes.
 To develop a model with the effects of income and wealth differences in
 a more general setting however (e.g.
 that of a developing economy), one needs a clear definition of what constitutes
 the needs of the consumer and her consumption for status.
 Without a clear separation between needs and quality (or luxury) that is
 also general enough to be used across cultural contexts, the macroeconomic
 factors, issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) may appear so intertwined
 with the needs of the consumer that a robust measure of status consumption
 can never be justified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the literature we have surveyed, the methods to standardise the macroeconomic
s inputs (welfare, growth, savings rate) and human needs have appeared far
 more rigorous than a definition of status-related consumption that is also
 general enough to be applied across various cultural contexts.
 The conspicuous consumption studies often make varied assumptions about
 what to include as part of conspicuous consumption and what not to.
 Some studies, for example, include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in the status-related items while others don't.
 In some cases, studies employ a consumer basket identified from a different
 economy on the basis of items being of conspicuous value by common knowledge.
 Except when a survey is used to identify 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 consumption, the contents of the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 tend to have items that are just commonly understood to have some signaling
 value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visibility surveys (see Heffetz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

) often provide the means to get around the problem of the dependence of
 classification of status items on a particular cultural context.
 The survey approach to classification of status items also lends itself
 to tractable models e.g.
 those provided by Ireland

 With an assumption that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the
 regular sense - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for
 visible consumption may be considered separable (additively) from the utility
 for non-visible consumption (we refer to this assumption as the futility
 assumption henceworth) .
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 Despite this much desirable tractability of visible consumption (see Ireland

 fundamental mechanisms for status consumption.
 The latter approach allows us to include wealth differences and the quality
 in an intertemporal setting - where the competing behaviours of snob and
 bandwagon items are put under an uncertainty perceived by the consumer

This uncertainty-based view of status considers status as one of the types
 of wealth that have an influence on whether the consumer chooses to consume
 in the short-term or invest for long-term purchases.
 Broadly speaking, status can be viewed as the consumer's long-term security
 from extreme income fluctuations.
 The idea of status as the consumer's long-term stability of income is aligned
 with how status is measured in the literature from health and sociological
 sciences - which often track status with a vector of income, education
 and occupation (see Michelson et al.

 for a few examples).
 While this approach allows us to consider long-term effects of stratification,
 it cannot be ruled out that status is a social psychological concern associated
 with an individual or a social unit (a reference group) and is always shaped
 by the observer.
 While a researcher can measure the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual
 - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk or 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability associated with the transition to the highest band of net-worth
 in the long-term, the consumer may have a particular subjective view of
 her status different from the view of the researcher.
 This is equivalent to saying that the consumer may consider uncertainties
 in income as well as the socio-political conditions that she directly perceives
 from within a particular social unit - family, community, town, ethnicity,
 region or country.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the point of view of the researcher interested in the long-term growth,
 a high-status individual is someone who has either or both of high income
 and a high (inter-generational) 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability to move towards the high income group (stability).
 Similarly, a low-status individual is someone who has either or both of
 low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 The researcher's view of status implicitly assumes that all consumers observe
 the same probability of transition to higher state of income.
 While the researcher is concerned with the long-term effect of such factors
 to the asset ownership and stability of income, the consumer may be motivated
 by particular short-term concerns with respect to the social unit that
 also influence her view of status.
 In other words, the consumer's subjective view of her wealth defines a
 subjective probability of the transition of her material wealth.

While this subjective view of her status is itself subject to change over
 her lifetime and is driven by an indeterminate number of factors such as
 her occupation, social or familial background, personality etc, such a
 view is likely to influnence consumption.
 Unlike the subjective probability which influences the consumption by the
 consumer, the growth in the income and wealth of the consumer are constrained
 with economic conditions.
 So even though a consumer may never determine her long-term wealth matrix,
 she has a certain view which is more accurate for the near term.
 
\end_layout

Consider three consumers with different occupations - an academic, a sportsman
 and an investor - who all estimate the probability of doubling wealth their
 in their lifetime.
 The sportsman is likely to overestimate the probability of her wealth until
 the middle of her lifetime - after which the probability.
 He long-term decisions would be determined by what sportsman in general
 do - but in the short-term she is to believe in an unrealistic possibility
 of success.
 Contrast this to the academic.
 They all manage risk in their own ways - with the sportsman taking more
 risk of assets overall.
 Their consumption, as a function of the their age is very much dependent
 on the perceived probability of success (because of the decisions they
 have to make in the economy - how?).

Since we view long-term assets as items that can be passed on to generations,
 the short-term concerns of the consumer in the model comprise only of needs
 and quality.
 Seen as the distance from the cost of needs, quality can be considered
 hedonic (i.e.
 it may correspond to a particular set of characteristics of the product
 which the consumer evaluates) or it may simply be seen as the habit of
 the consumer

 In either case, if there is any status related utility to be derived from
 non-durable consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from quality
 (which is defined as distance from needs) and would be determined by the
 short-term concerns of the consumer.
 This is because a consumer with a habit of high-quality in consumption
 (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment of needs) would 
\shape italic

have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfilment of consumer needs itself carries no such influence on status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can therefore introduce two uncertainties in the model - the first associated
 with the long-term growth of wealth and the second with a short-term gain
 - permitting the consumer to deviate from the long-term rational plan that
 she would enter into based on the long-term economic variables (which the
 researcher may be interested in).
 The disproportionate expenditure on visible goods by those perceived to
 have lower status - can be viewed in the model as the consumer's high

 Similarly, the perceived threat of immigration to one's personal wealth

 The view of the researcher is essentially a view of long-term growth of
 the consumer whereas the short-term views of the consumer that push the
 consumer away from her basic needs are influenced by short-term concerns
 and perceived self-image.
 The two uncertainties are what allow the the representative consumer in
 the model to deviate from a long-term plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we further elaborate our subjective probability view of status, it
 is worth noting the two uncertainties have particular implications in the
 context of status consumption.
 That a consumer may not view the true probability of her long-term growth
 or mobility may appear in conflict with the free-market view which considers
 the autonomous consumer fully capable of addressing her true needs (i.e.
 the view that needs are simply subjective preferences
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Indeed the core of Adam Smith's arguments had been that the differences
 in purchasing power between sections of a society as well as their desire
 for mobility can drive consumption and economy.
 The free-market view of economic progress essentially relies on letting
 this exchange between the rich and poor sections thrive
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In terms of our model, this amounts to the 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability being the same as the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of social mobility - a condition that we refer to as the parity
 condition.
 The parity condition would imply that the households optimise expenditure
 based on future income expectations that they develop based on the observations
 of past mobility.
 Therefore, a lower status (i.e.
 lower asset possession or lower education) would encourage the consumer
 to save for high-cost assets or invest in characteristics that enhance
 her success and rather than indicating status through high quality in certain
 categories (e.g.
 luxury items) that are meant to accompany high-status.
 If the parity conditions is not met, on the other hand, the consumers would
 not view the true observed probability of their mobility and their wants
 (which they estimate through a perceived probability ) would not achieve
 their true needs.
 The latter non-parity condition is indeed what the literature on conspicuous
 consumption and the descriptive economic theories from behavioural economics
 would find (see Blanden-Machin

\shape default
 on the measurement of social mobility based on the life-cycle transition
 in the identified income and occupation groups).
 In the very long run, there may not be a conflict between the two perspectives
 as the demand for non-durable consumption beyond needs should not matter
 towards accumulation of wealth beyond a few generations.
 In terms of the two uncertainties we have described, the parity condition
 is not necessary for a long-term equilibrium involving the second uncertainty.
 Further, the fundamental changes in an economy such as rapid industrialisation,
 advertising effects, centralisation of markets or their expansion can cause
 the difference between two uncertainties to narrow or expand.

It is worth comparing our approach - at this point - with the permanent
 income hypothesis
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The fundamental claim of the PIH is that income has a transitory and a
 permanent component where the consumption is directly proportional to the
 permanent component
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The observed income of an individual (household) is the sum of transitory
 and permanent income components

 - so that the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with
 her income - requiring her to maintain buffer stocks for her needs.
 Like in PIH, we also rely on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancellation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of short-term fluctuations in the long-run and recognise the role of inheritanc
e (which PIH views as an increase in the permanent income).
 But Friedman's assumption of the independence (zero-correlation) between
 the transitory component and the permanent component - is a condition much
 stronger than what we may require.
 While Friedman's empirical analysis observes the dispersion in income amongst
 social classes (gauged with a simple variance in past income), we are also
 interested in the dispersion in quality and wealth owing to social hierarchy.
 Unlike PIH, therefore, we do not explicitly ignore the role of

While relative income hypothesis (see Duesenberry 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Duesenberry1949"

) could be incorporated in PIH, the latter does not explain why low-income
 does not always encourage high saving (i.e.
 the significance of status consumption).
 One could say more generally that a rational consumer predicting future
 incomes based on the past incomes, has no reason to engage in any status
 related consumption (neither in short-term nor in long-term).
 This is how our two-uncertainties approach fundamentally differs from a
 conventional approach.
 We attach an uncertainty to the advantage that one receives from status
 consumption - for if there is indeed nothing to be gained by status-related
 consumption (the assumption of conspicuous consumption being essentially
 futile), then there is no way for the rational consumer to derive any utility
 from status-related consumption.
 The subjective uncertainty attached with the consumption is explicit and
 detached from the process of economic growth - allowing the consumer to
 deviate from her long-term plans.
 Unlike in PIH, the uncertainties associated with the short-term preferences
 and the long-term preferences are not independent of each other.
 Even though no consumer may truly know the probability of change in states
 of wealth, the consumer can estimate this probability around a long-term
 process.
 The two uncertainties are thus related with an exogenous income process
 (the details of the process are discussed in Section

 who argue that there should be no overeating and overspending if the consumers
 were rational.
 In the context of status consumption which we are concerned with, the mere
 existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there is some utility
 to be derived by spending what is not rationally advantageous to the consumer
 in the long-term.
 The models of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Focusing on quality and assets rather than visibility, our approach therefore
 does not diminish the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption but only aspires to include it in a wider concern for status
 and growth in income.
 By means of an analogy, let's consider a market for cars where status is
 signalled through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption might tell us that the consumers
 pay more attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would also want to see i) the constraints on occupation
 and income that exist in the respective areas and ii) the price differences
 in the cars being sold in the market.
 In the context of status consumption, while it may be true that individuals
 spend more on their outward appearances (despite controlling for everything
 else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not all what the
 expectation of status consumption over time may comprise of (see the Figure

 for the terminology around status consumption).
 As argued before, the status consumption is more than visible consumption.
 Therefore, not all high quality consumption is visible.
 In particular, some higher quality non-durable consumption (such as using
 electricity in a developing country) may not be visible in nature but must
 accompany higher durable consumption that may in turn be visible (electrical
 equipment etc.).
 Similarly, while a visible item is effectively a high-quality item in our
 framework, not all visible consumption qualifies as high quality consumption
 either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visible consumption can be explained with our framework using the ownership
 of assets or long-term wealth are considered.
 If the consumer preferences for needs across different commodity groups
 and the assets she acquires have been factored in, visibility expressed
 through non-durable consumption (i.e.
 visible consumption) can viewed as part of the preference order for quality
 across the groups.
 More particularly, as prices of commodities change or new goods are introduced,
 the consumer may adjust her quality of non-durable consumption (once her
 needs are met) based on a preference order over the commodity groups.
 For example, a consumer may consider quality for transport more important
 than quality in food (or vice versa).
 In terms of our framework therefore, the commodities such as food would
 be less visible than household or entertainment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term needs does
 not view status consumption as futile but relates it with an expectation
 of social mobility - which the consumer considers after fulfilment of basic
 needs and which is influenced both with long-term possessions and non-durable
 consumption.
 The relevance of a social-identity to status is modeled through an expectation
 of high status through a history of past asset ownership, incomes/occupations
 (a criterion that makes the consumer raise her expectations through association
 with the identity).

Status as utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A property of utility function from where much of the model should follow
 is that status - defined as a subjective perception of the stable high
 net-worth - is constituted in the consumer's long-term utility.
 If not, the model's representative consumer would have no reason to engage
 in status-related consumption in any form.
 That the consumer may deviate from her long-term plans introduces an explicit
 uncertainty in the model - since a consumer has limited knowledge of the
 future states of her wealth.
 At the same time, the growth of her income process - which is influenced
 by characteristics of the economy - is associated with an uncertainty different
 from the consumer's subjective uncertainty - thereby allowing the representativ
e consumer in the model to assign a higher probability to landing in a state
 of higher status than what is known through more deterministic trends of
 income to a someone observing the long-term growth in consumer wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the market's point of view, one could say that the consumer's risk-seekin
g behaviour for lower payoffs relative to higher payoffs (and risk-aversion
 for higher payoffs compared to lower) given a choice between saving and
 quality is likely to be known to the firms in the market - that may transform
 the consumer's perceived probability of promotion of her status/net-worth
 through consumption.
 Thus, even though the assets may be a surer way to achieve status i.e.
 indicate wealth and achieve security - they would require more will-power
 and patience to accumulate whereas quality may appear relatively more affordabl
e and accessible through market.
 For example, a low-income individual may be less likely to buy a luxury
 car in the market but may still be willing to compromise on other needs
 if a rental luxury car is made available and advertised aggressively through
 marketing campaigns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a
 consumer can achieve higher-status state in the model not only by the acquisiti
on of assets (which is assisted with higher income) but also by the less
 definite increase of chances of status promotion through 
\bar under
social interactions 
\bar default
(requiring higher quality relative consumption).
 The consumer's subjective which drives such consumption is not necessarily
 an inaccurate view of the physical probability of the inter-generational
 social mobility but in fact a a perception of risk that she may share with
 others in her reference group.
 In the long-term, the wealth (status or assets) the consumer acquires would
 eventually be aligned with the income process while her short-term view
 would have addressed the demand for needs and quality through non-durable
 consumption.
 Thus the role of non-durable consumption is two-fold in the model - first,
 it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer and second, it also matches
 the consumer's (subjective) perception of her own trajectory of status
 promotion through high-quality consumption.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity in
 the present and a less definite perceived likelihood of improving social
 networks (than that from long-term assets) to the consumer.
 Notice that we treat any expenditure above the basic needs as an expenditure
 on quality - regardless of what characteristics carrying quality are being
 priced in the market
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenImplicitHedonic1974,DeatonEconConsumer"

 We also argue that assets themselves would bring some quality constraints
 - thus segregating ways in which quality is consumed between those own
 assets and those who don't.

Recall that we have associated

 The first uncertainty, i.e.
 likelihood of quality influencing the future states of wealth are merely
 estimates of the consumer.
 While short-term requirements of the consumers are subject to the perception

\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability , the second uncertainty i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability derived from the consumer's long term trajectory must be aligned
 with the income process through intergenerational transfers and economy
 developments.
 Conceptually, this is not so different from how transitory components of
 income are expected to cancel out in the permanent income approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 What we have introduced is the separation of consumer's uncertainty about
 the process of wealth transformation (an uncertainty that results in deviation
 from needs as high quality consumption) from the uncertainty in the income
 process - while tracking the two with different variables in the econometric
 analyses.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"

\end_inset

, the purpose of considering two levels of uncertainty is to allow the represent
ative consumer to deviate from her long-term plans (which are themselves
 assumed to be exogenous in the model and contribute to the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 uncertainty).
 The two uncertainties in the model are a consequence of i) status bringing
 some utility to the consumer and ii) the permitted deviation from the consumer'
s long-term plans influenced by possession of assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth clarifying that treating quality in non-durable status-related
 consumption as a deviation from long-term plans and needs is not the same
 as viewing conspicuous consumption as the consumer's error in judgment.
 By tracking consumer's deviation from her needs and equating consumption
 of quality with 
\shape italic
perceived
\shape default
 probability, we do not make any descriptive claims about the consumer's
 belief.
 Since consumption is myopic while savings are cumulative, the association
 of a felicity from quality with the perceived probability of status promotion
 is for us only a way to differentiate the more certain probabilities of
 the income process from those that contribute to the deviation from fulfillment
 of basic needs in the short-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also worth emphasising that conspicuous consumption should not appear
 trivialised when viewed as mere higher-quality consumption.
 We find that a lot of appeal for conspicuous consumption in the public
 discourse is formed due to it being presented as a phenomenon that only-serves-
the-rich.
 Even though a conspicuous item is seen as an item that is used both to
 distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself, there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst
 the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 A view that considers conspicuous consumption a way to distinguish oneself
 from one's own reference group and the reference wealth level through consumpti
on would need to admit a more general definition of status consumption that
 considers the effect of the distance from fulfilment of basic needs on
 the the consumer's signaling.
 If we can agree that the signaling behaviour can be exhibited by everyone
 and cause a direct (albeit probabilistic) improvement of the consumer's
 perceived status, then an increase in her consumption corresponding to
 her perceived status is justified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason to object to the view of status consumption as a consumption
 exclusive to the rich is that the utility to the rich from status consumption
 might be quite little given the rich consumer may already have enough to
 distance herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have
 anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave
 anyone behind) - but we argue that even the poorest may want to indicate
 that they are not the poorest (much the way richest may want it to be known
 to the others that they are indeed the richest)

.
 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 is needed for everybody - as everyone in the middle (those who are neither
 the richest nor the poorest) must also try to avoid getting poorer and
 try to become the richest at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The claim that perceived status is matched with consumption is akin to claiming
 that there is a probabilistic private utility to be derived from conspicuous
 consumption.
 A luxury watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared to
 its cheaper alternatives with same functionality), but if an aspiring businessm
an uses his knowledge of luxury watches to find new clients for her business,
 then the futile consumption can translate into a material advantage.
 The perception of status - however unrealistic - can influence one's wealth
 if everyone in one's reference group also acts in accordance to the perception.
 It may be apt to consider conspicuous consumption futile but only in a
 sense that is different from what a modeler would be concerned with.
 Items like luxury watches are important only because the rich flock around
 them.
 Thus if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
 However, the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may offer is
 important as it acts as a means of connecting the rich with the not-so
 rich.
 A belief in social mobility is therefore key to status consumption - which
 as part of high-quality consumption - offers an advantage to the representative
 consumer that is driven by a small chance of success - a probability which
 the consumer is likely to overestimate or underestimate.
 In the example of luxury watches, we know that only a few of the purchasers
 of luxury watches would improve their self-image and enhance their social
 networks - others would remain mere purchasers.
 As explained before, we are not concerned with how many of the businessmen
 actually believe that conspicuous consumption would help them (i.e.
 we do not attempt to describe their beliefs) - as we are only interested
 in how many buyers of luxury watches actually achieve success over the
 long term.
 Their purchase of luxury watches would indicate their perceived probability
 of success while the rises in their incomes would indicate the observed
 probability where the characteristics other than luxury watch ownership
 may dominate.

\begin_layout Standard
In the operationalisation of the model, the long-term assets as well as
 the exogenous income process are what reconcile the two uncertainties.
 The items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 are considered long-term assets while those that cannot be passed are considere
d short-term.
 The observed probability is contributed to by the assets transferred between
 generations in the long-run as there is little more than the net asset
 worth of the individual - whose probability is determined by factors more
 tangible than perception i.e.
 factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.
 - that are passed over as inheritance.
 The subjective probability of success through social interactions and high
 quality consumption associated with it need not matter in the long-term
 as the path to net asset worth may completely ignore the non-durable consumptio
n habits of the past.
 Unlike with a permanent income approach the two uncertainties are thus
 not expected to be independent of each other but are reconciled by transfer
 and ownership of long-term assets in the economy.

Needs, consumption and wealth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having associated quality with less certain perception of social connections
 and ownership of long-term assets with more certain parameters of growth
 income, we now turn to how a consumer may achieve both in the context of
 needs and prices.
 Our view of non-durable status-related consumption is essentially that
 of non-necessary consumption - and thus empirically, it must rely on a
 sound definition of needs - which provide the reference point for quality
 in the model.
 That there must be the idea of universal needs is itself a contentious
 issue.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs can supersede
 her subjective interests (wants).
 We lean towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need
 of the consumer without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts should be standardised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Health and autonomy may be fairly abstract ideas when the context of consumption
 is not limited to food and employment.
 When considering quality in food, for example, this seems a relatively
 easy task as we may just consider the cost of the cheapest option for proteins,
 carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area.
 For contexts other than food, however, what constitutes basic needs is
 less trivial.
 For example, what constitutes a basic house or a basic set of furniture
 would require some justification based on a cultural or geographic context.
 Standardising needs in terms of the quantity of non-durable consumption
 poses another issue - since the non-durable consumption may depend on the
 long-term assets that the consumer possesses.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and thus a high non-durable consumption
 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical assets would not have
 the respective non-durable consumption).
 To get around the issue, one may therefore consider needs at the asset
 level rather than at the level of non-durable consumption.
 In other words, to answer the question whether electricity is a need or
 not one must answer whether possession of the electrical equipment is a
 need or not.
 One the level of basic needs in a population of consumers is established,
 the cost of needs of the consumer are driven the local price of the needs
 and a certain personal characteristics (e.g.
 residence in an expensive region).
 It may make sense therefore to attach a quality requirement (constraint)
 to the level of asset ownership the consumer achieves or to the long-term
 characteristic she possesses.
 This is in more detail in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that status is not considered a need using this
 approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the asset
 level she achieves while the her basic needs are independent of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption - whether for the researcher
 or the consumer - is derived by both assets and quality (across all commodities
) - driven by wealth and income of the consumer (rather than high-class
 or low-class needs of the consumer).
 As an example, the difference between the status of a rich and that of
 a poor family in our model is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 the family combined with a demand for quality for education (with a higher
 price for higher quality).
 It may thus be possible to proxy the needs of the family simply by number
 of members in the family (adjusted by their age).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference point of needs is crucial to our view of quality as it is
 simply a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 If the quality of consumption calculated in such a manner is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\rho,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of assets owned 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 education, occupation) of the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 By the definition of needs, the consumer cannot compromise on needs to
 address quality or asset accumulation - therefore can is omitted from the
 utility function.
 Since consumption changes with the perceptions of wealth, the dependence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\rho$
\end_inset

 can give some structure to the utility.
 For example, while a consumer may want to improve quality instead of saving
 for an asset, the quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may not be improved beyond a certain point until more assets are purchased.
 For example, in the household category, high prices of housing may encourage
 the consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus improve 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) but she may improve the quality instead of buying a bigger house only
 until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 Here, the consumption of quality moves together with assets that the consumer
 acquires.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dependence also has implications on the additivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(A,\rho,\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The limited substitution between assets and non-durable consumption allows
 us to express the utility function as 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon=f(A)+g(\rho)+m(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 As the consumer matches her consumption with the perceived wealth and certain
 high quality non-durable consumption is available only when associated
 with a corresponding asset or a long-term characteristic (such as education,
 housing, identity, region owing to segregation, trade barriers etc.), higher
 quality choices would accompany higher-quality assets.
 The substitution between low-quality asset and high-quality non-durable
 consumption being limited due to co-movement of expensive non-durable consumpti
on with expensive asset ownership also means that the quality differences
 in the assets can be ignored.
 A high-quality asset is merely a more expensive asset in the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(A,\rho,\nu)$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider how price derivatives may enter the utility and consumer
 decision.
 Without price changes, the consumption of quality would change only when
 individuals acquire long-term durable goods or give up hopes of acquiring
 costlier assets (possibly due to other needs).
 As the consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality, a rise in
 quality must come either from an increase in income or from an undercut
 in savings.
 Similarly, if needs stay the same, a drop in quality must be due to purchase
 of assets or a drop in income.
 Empirically, the prices are attached with a commodity rather than overall
 quality.
 So, to consider price changes, one must consider the price of needs as
 well as the price of quality across the various commodities.
 Therefore, faced with change in prices, a consumer may prefer quality in
 one commodity over another (i.e.
 a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport to food or
 vice versa) as she addresses her needs and long-term assets requirements.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider a middle-income family that
 moves to a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants
 are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place.
 One way to view this change in the consumer's circumstances is to observe
 that the price of entertainment services are lower for the consumer in
 the new neighborhoods.
 Assuming the needs of the family (indicated by the number of family members)
 haven't changed, the consumption would either shift to saving for a better
 car or improve quality in some other category (better jewelry, better schooling
 for kids etc.) The sensitivity of consumption with respect to price thus
 comprises of sensitivity with respect to basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\eta_{t}}$
\end_inset

as well as a sensitivity with respect to quality for each commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\nu_{t}}$
\end_inset

.

Comparing Status consumption across economies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The separate of uncertainty in the income process from that of consumer's
 perception of wealth is also useful in a comparison of two economies that
 are disparate in macroeconomic terms - e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy.
 If we may set 
\shape italic
a priori
\shape default
 inputs to the uncertainty in income growth (i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability) to compare the two economies, we may be able to separate the
 effects of supply issues from the demand for status in the respective economies.
 When comparing a developed economy with a developing economy, the strength
 of welfare institutions is of a particular significance.
 One would find that in the developed economy the state institutions intervene
 when market forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertaki
ngs or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distributio
n of public goods.
 When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 The uncertainty in observed probability can capture this difference as
 we compare developed economy with a developing economy and help separate
 the consumer demand from the disparate economic preconditions

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate why the uncertainty of an income process may be important
 for measures of status consumption, consider the status imparted through
 education - whose quality may vary in the market.
 As a consequence of the difference in expectation of growth, education
 may carry more status-value in the developing world than it would in the
 developed world - simply because the distribution of education (and other
 similar assets that may be public goods) are state-assisted in a developed
 country so that the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny
 is lowered.
 Thus, the extent to which education may eventually matter towards status
 in the developed economy depends on how consumers set themselves apart
 in the social order based on other determinants of status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), a consumer would
 associate higher risk with the expected growth in education (which can
 be modeled with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability in the income process).
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support in a developing country.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions thus determines the expectation of accumulation
 of public goods (such as family education level) as how much education
 may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect of the strength of
 institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets that may provide
 the expanded consumption choices to the consumer.
 The two uncertainties in the model allow us to perform such comparisons
 by parametrising the disparate conditions as 
\shape italic

 probability 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If one chooses to ignore the modeling of a parameter for strength of welfare
 institutions altogether (due to the belief that the demand for conspicuous
 consumption eventually benefits the society as a whole as the money is
 reinvested for the benefit of the poor in exchange for their services),
 it would still be instructive to parametrise the efficacy of institutions
 that would collect the money obtained from the rich on conspicuous items
 and fund employment and other opportunities.

 More specifically, if we consider a dynamic process for

to 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\rho,A,\nu)$

Model Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the properties of the utility function discussed so far, we now discuss
 the evolution of the three observed variables in the model.
 These are the needs of the consumer, the assets owned and the income of
 the consumer.
 We also observe the consumption within certain categories (which for in
 the current chapter are food, energy, transport and household) that are
 then related with observed variables with the quality control that the
 consumer exercises.
 These variables are assimilated in the Euler equations corresponding to
 the intertemporal substitution setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current chapter we consider a non-stochastic model that is calibrated
 to the LSMS data from Tanzania to explain the choice for quality in a typical
 developing economy.
 While the non-stochastic nature of the model does not permit us to differentiat
e between the uncertainty in one's income from that of the long-term uncertainty
 that is set by social class or education from, the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 can be explicitly separated from the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a non-stochastic approach.
 Much the way the two uncertainties allow a consumer to deviate from her
 long-term plans and spend on quality in the short-term, the non-stochastic
 model can use a cost-function associated with the owned assets and personal
 characteristics which may discourage the consumer from acquiring assets
 as savings and consumption are limited by the total income constraint.
 The cost-function thus also serves as the non-stochastic means to allow
 the consumer to match the quality in consumption with her perceived status.

\begin_layout Subsubsection

Needs of the consumer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have hinted in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:nonstochproblem"

\end_inset

, our notion of quality is dependent on what we consider as needs rather
 than the characteristics of items (see Rosen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenImplicitHedonic1974"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a summary of hedonic approaches).
 We define needs as the standard requirements not meeting which would lead
 to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory argued for by Doyal
 and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, the counter-argument
 would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the consumer incurred
 by not having other nutrients is definite thus ruling out a starch diet
 fulfilling the set of dietary needs.
 However, such a theory of needs is a normative concern (rather than descriptive
) - as a consumer may not always want her needs.
 Such a model for needs cannot represent a situation where consumers forgo
 a certain need to compromise on their health or autonomy in favour of some
 other wants.
 This makes the task to ensure that the needs are indeed just a minimum
 necessary set for health and autonomy to the individual extremely important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the minimum requirements for commodities such as food, clothing,
 housing and employment and calculate the costs associated with them in
 the local context (at a district level in the Tanzanian data - for example).
 The cost of the basic requirements per head 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 thus calculated are then multiplied with the number of family members 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 to obtain the cost of needs of the household (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}\cdot\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Relying only on total costs associated with a commodity (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality cannot differentia
te between the consumption of a higher quantity and of a higher quality.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 for a commodity priced 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$
\end_inset

, then our quality metric for the consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

).
 However, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity are
 available in the region or not, it may be possible to draw conclusions
 about overconsumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
The uncertainty associated with how 
\bar default
a consumer's needs would evolve until the end of her lifetime is very little
 to begin with.
 So in a non-stochastic setting, one can assume that the consumer knows
 the path of her needs over the lifetime.
 We can choose to model the needs associated with the household as unit
 that lives forever (dynasty) or as a household individual with a finite
 lifetime 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Regardless, the evolution of needs as the number of living family members
 at a certain period ought to be aligned with the population trends in the
 economy.
 In the particular context of a developing country, we find that the expected
 path of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t,T)$
\end_inset

 is influenced with a high population growth rate and prevalence of a joint-fami
ly structure.
 The functional form 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t,T)=\mathbbm{1}_{t<T}\mu te^{-\kappa t^{2}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $t$

 household is used to elicit

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the income process in the model is to separate the factors affecting
 economic growth from the factors that influence the consumption of quality.
 The separation of this income process is critical to our notion of status-relat
ed consumption (considered as part of the distance from needs) - which we
 argue is driven not simply by the expectations of income but also with
 the longer-term beliefs related to success due to class, educational level,
 occupation (
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 as costs function cover the effect of education - what constraints doe
 education bring - is a segregation influenced by education and occupation
 evident in the econometric methods arising from a model where 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 is merely costs due to assets
\series default
)? In other words, the behavioural perspective on types of wealth implies
 that the consumers' saving for assets is influenced not simply by income
 or its volatility alone (as implied by the permanent income approach) but
 also through longer-term notions of wealth which are measurable with personal
 characteristics such as education as well as the long-term assets
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We attach no uncertainty to the growth of income in this non-stochastic
 model.
 Thus the growth rate would remain the same forever and is known by the
 consumer.
 In the stochastic model, on the other hand, one could let the consumer
 maintain two uncertainties - the first being in how her annual income unfolds
 in her future years and the second before how she becomes part of a stable
 high-consumption club through means other than income growth.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus while the exogenous income process may be dependent on education or
 occupation levels, the effect that long-term characteristics have on consumptio
n may be direct either through constraints or the stability that the characteris
tics bring.
 As the effects of these on consumption are modeled explicitly, what we
 need to represent with an income process is only the expectation of the
 monetary growth i.e.
 a reflection of the steady growth in the economy on to the consumer's budget.
 For the treatment of the Tanzanian data with the non-stochastic model discussed
 in the current chapter, we have assumed a simple process of income so that
 the income grows at a steady rate 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 every year i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}=i_{0}k^{t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the starting income, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the time period and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the rate of growth per period.
 Here, the past values of 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 do not influence the current and future values of (or influence them only
 through long-term characteristics characteristics such as education).
 We make two further simplifying assumptions in the process.
 First, a zero interest rate environment (which is easy to introduce if
 considered necessary) is assumed.
 Second, due to the minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing
 countries, we assume a negligible credit in the market.
 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only asset available in the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Change in asset ownership over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wealth of a consumer - coinciding with the notion of her ontological
 status - is represented in the model with a combination of accumulated
 assets and the personal characteristics (education, occupation or social
 identity).
 The asset ownership is modeled with an an asset account - whose value is
 reflected in the total cost of assets inclusive of cash assets that the
 consumer owns.
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase assets and the actual purchase
 of assets.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
 Also since we are concerned with the near-term purchases in the current
 model, no depreciation in the asset values is assumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all assets in
 the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success to preferences
 being the same for everybody) that provides furniture, housing and all
 amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every asset and service - offered as a life-long subscription - can be
 purchased by giving an amount to this company.
 We also assume that at the of the lifetime of a consumer, her personal
 wealth would either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so
 that the asset account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth
 of someone else in the economy.
 Consequently, while all individuals in the population are assumed to be
 the same as our representative consumer in terms of the preferences for
 needs over quality, they differ in the the starting amount of their asset
 accounts as well as the trends of their salaries, the trajectory of their
 needs and their long-term quality habits.
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and a steady growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, she would after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working her salary is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}k^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the total income she has earned is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{\tau}i_{j}=\frac{i_{0}k}{k-1}(k^{\tau}-1)$
\end_inset

.
 At a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased assets from a portion of her income and decided
 that she does not want more assets for the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, her life circumstances might have changed (she may need
 a bigger house or want a more expensive house) thus needing more assets
 urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

) as a multiplier of the cost of needs - the higher its value the higher
 is the distance from the basic needs consumption and lower is the future
 growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 One could also introduce some inertia for quality in the model by considering
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{w}$
\end_inset

 a long-term habit of the consumer that remains the same over the period
 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 Other than this parameter, the consumption depends both on needs and the
 long-term choices of the consumer (which are encapsulated by the asset
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 the consumer has accumulated in the past and the the personal characteristics
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 she possesses).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now elaborate that certain non-durable costs are imposed by the assets
 one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.).
 These costs mean that either that avoiding the respective expenses is not
 an option for the consumer or that some certain long-term choices or characteri
stics (e.g.
 not having a house or living in a region that doesn't have electricity
 available) would limit the choice to avail quality through non-durable
 consumption.
 For example, a homeowner is required to maintain her own house the way
 someone who doesn't own the house has to pay the rent.
 As some costs are incurred due to the assets that the consumer acquires,
 a distance from the basic needs (which are themselves imposed only by health
 and autonomy requirements) could be introduced as the consumer acquires
 more assets.
 Such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

enhanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 needs of the consumer as she acquires assets necessitate a parameter in
 the model that is different from the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and separates how much the consumer choice is related to her long-term
 standing influenced by 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 from how much quality is demanded in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 We denote this former constraint with the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 - which along with the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 selected by the consumer contributes to the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 effectively adjusts the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 with the costs incurred due to asset ownership (e.g.
 of maintenance fees or rent in the housing example).
 The non-stochastic Euler equations for this model are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\eta_{t}=\eta(t,T)\nonumber \\
A_{t+1}=A_{t}+(i_{t+1}-c_{t+1})\nonumber \\

c_{t+1}=\nu_{t}\eta_{t}p(A_{t},\rho)\label{eq:nonstoch}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 represents the consumer needs at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the value of asset account in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (comprising of cash reserved for assets as well as the total value of assets
 owned), 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are the static household characteristics (educational level, religious
 or social identity etc.), 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the income obtained in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 the consumption in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The cost of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 represents the minimal per-head quality that a household has to maintain
 given her personal characteristics and owned assets is scaled with the
 needs of the consumer.
 A desirable feature of this specification is that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can also be approximated outside of the demand framework allowing us to
 view peer effects solely in the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Another way to interpret the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 is viewing how a consumer matches her consumption with the assets she owns
 and the long-term characteristics she acquires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more specific form of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 for a given commodity depends both on the prices of the different quality
 variants of the commodity and how sparsely the variants are distributed
 across the population.
 The cost incurred due to assets i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can be directly estimated from the data.
 Consider, for example, the cost of housing.
 When the consumer owns a house, this would be the mortgage fee or maintenance
 fees but when the consumer does not own a house the constraint becomes
 the rent.

It is worth clarifying that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 itself cannot be a part of utility.
 The model needs to represent benefit derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 into consumption - which is what the consumer benefits from.
 So except for status purpose, education cannot give utility to the consumer.
 In the stochastic environment, this would affect 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 but in a non-stochastic model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 does not influence consumption directly.
 The only obvious way to do this is to let consumer have a rebate on educational
 expenses.
 High asset ownership gives income as well.
 That does not seem to be supported in the model.
 This is because high assets are meant to achieve a state desirable in itself.
 But it worth adding explicit security to assets.

 and view the quality control
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 as a proportion of income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 The Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 can thus be reformulated as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

For the dynamic optimisation problem of maximising 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{T}u(c_{i},A_{i},\eta_{i})$
\end_inset

, we also impose the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}\ge c_{t}$
\end_inset

 to ensure that the consumer does not exercise the choice to sell assets
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 in order to consume.
 The constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}\ge c_{t}$
\end_inset

 along with the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\ge1$
\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\nu\le\frac{1}{mA_{t}^{a}\eta_{t}}$
\end_inset

.
 If the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is to be the same throughout the 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 periods, the constraint implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $m,a$
\end_inset

 must be chosen so that 
\begin_inset Formula $mA_{t}^{a}\eta_{t}\le1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le t\le T$
\end_inset

 In the equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the value 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 represents the consumption in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 and thus the consumption in the first year (
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

) is part of the initial condition - as is the value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 .
 Given the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 - for which the consumption is 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 and assets ownership are 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t-1},c_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t-1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 so that the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha log(A_{t})+\beta log(c_{t})+(1-\alpha-\beta)log(\eta_{t})$
\end_inset

 is maximised.
 Since the consumer does not exercise any choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

, we can focus on 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta log(c_{t})=\beta log(\nu mA_{t-1}^{a}i_{t-1}\eta_{t-1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha log(A_{t})=\alpha log(A_{t-1}+i_{t-1}(k-\nu mA_{t-1}^{a}\eta_{t-1}))$
\end_inset

 A 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 that maximises 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{t}=\beta log(\nu mA_{t-1}^{a}i_{t-1}\eta_{t-1})+\alpha log(A_{t-1}+i_{t-1}(k-\nu mA_{t-1}^{a}\eta_{t-1}))$

 would satisfy the first-order condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U_{t}}{\partial\nu}=0$

 Thus, the optimal solution for would be at time

Another way to solve a non-stochastic intertemporal problem is by drawing
 an equivalence between total wealth with total outlay in the classical
 consumer choice problem before using similar econometric methods.
 Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\beta ln(x)+\gamma ln(p)+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 commonly used in estimation derived effectively from 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x\Rightarrow log(w_{i})=log(p_{i})+log(g(x,p))-log(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Here, with 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,p)$
\end_inset

 as the Marshallian demand function, using the double-logarithmic model
 (which is a mere restatement of existence of elasticities through total
 differentiation), we have 
\begin_inset Formula $log(g(x,p))=\alpha_{i}+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}log(x)+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p)}log(p)$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $log(w_{i})=\alpha_{i}+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}-1)log(x)+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{i})}+1)log(p_{i})+\sum_{j\ne i}\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{j})}log(p_{j})$
\end_inset

.
 The adding up restriction is more difficult to impose on this form rather
 than the slightly modified : 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{i}log(x)+\gamma_{i}log(p_{i})$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 An estimation of demand elasticities of consumption can be performed using
 parallel - arguments using the total wealth constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

.
 In such a formulation, the constraint for the consumer can be stated as
 the total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\delta_{i}(A_{T}+\sum c_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 are the assets accumulated over the period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and the discount factors can be chosen as
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{i}=\frac{1}{1+i}$
\end_inset

 (this holds even if one assumes that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 is 0 at the end by the consumer spending everything as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{T}$
\end_inset

 at the end of period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 Equivalent to the case of income constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}=x$
\end_inset

 for the maximisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\textbf{q})$
\end_inset

, the wealth constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is meant to be known to the representative consumer i.e.
 the consumer chooses a plan for 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i},A_{i}$
\end_inset

 knowing what her total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and future expectations of prices are.
 The demand function would be 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=g(W,p)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the price of consumption.

The obvious limitation of the non-stochastic approach is the independence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 from the degree of uncertainty in the model parameters.
 Therefore, the non-stochastic model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

 disregards the beliefs in social mobility that may motivate increases risky
 behaviour to the consumer.
 As the only way for a consumer to reach a higher status in the non-stochastic
 model is through accumulation of assets i.e.
 growth in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (or change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

), she is likely to settle for low range 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (and consequently have low-status) if she wants to keep 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 low and high 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 Therefore by diminishing the role of social mobility, the model over-emphasizes
 the role that the starting value of

 plays towards gaining status through 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

Needs are related to consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 through their cost in the particular locality where the household is located.
 Given the categories of consumption in Tanzania i.e.
 food, household, energy and transport, we calculate the cost of basic needs
 as the cost a minimal requirements in every category.
 As an example, we use the commodity sub-groups of carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables in the food category.
 The cost of this minimal basket - which is composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - are then calculated in each region and district based
 on the prices of the items recorded in the survey (which records the prices
 at the district level as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket could be a
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - as these are most often
 the cheapest items in their respective sub-group (
\begin_inset Formula ${carb,fact,protein,fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the cost of this basket thus calculated is much higher
 in the urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) when available.
 For household, the cost of the minimal house in the locality (amortised
 over the average working life) and the cost of clothing per year is used.
 For transport, we use public-transport costs and petrol consumption costs
 depending on where the consume resides and whether the consumer owns a
 car or not.

To estimate the income process, we use the reported income from primary
 occupations in the Tanzania LSMS data over the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 One limitation of the Tanzanian LSMS data is that it does not provide income
 data for every household head for which the consumption diary and assets
 are recorded.
 Another limitation of the data set is that a household that is visited
 in a particular year is less likely to be visited after more than 2 years.
 This means that while a significant number households would be common between
 2010 and 2012 as well as between 2012 and 2014, very few households that
 were visited in 2010 would be visited the third time in 2014 (in fact less
 than 100 household from the survey in 2010 seem to be visited in 2014 for
 income survey).
 Such a lack of a true panel data compels us to prepare a pseudo-panel for
 the calibration of the income process.
 The pseudo-panel we prepare is based on the similarity of the number of
 adults, the number of children, the year of birth of the adults, the occupation
 and education levels

A minor issue encountered while the preparation of the pseudo-panel related
 to the age of the household members was circumvented with an approximate
 matching of that year-of-birth values.
 The LSMS community survey appears to have recorded the year-of-birth values
 for individuals in years 2010 and 2012 but the age variable is recorded
 instead for the year 2014.
 Matching the year-of-birth values from 2012 with the YOB values inferred
 from the recorded age was made possible by allowing a tolerance for matching
 the YOB values for the preparation of the pseudo-panel.

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$

 The effect of having constraints on quality due to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is thus equivalent to addition or removal of items from the consumer basket.
 If a rural consumer who has access to only some of the items from the urban
 basket (which an urban consumer has access to), the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 she chooses is equivalent to removing some items from the urban consumer's
 basket.
 Thus the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can also be seen as a filter on the set of prices of a basket of all items
 (i.e.
 items available at a national level or at the respective top level of granulari
ty in an empirical) that returns the costs pertinent to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 Equivalently, when the consumer acquires more assets, her basket effectively
 expands as she is forced to be away from basic needs consumption cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}$

The choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is also subject to region as well.
 More variation in basket (more items within a commodity) would result in
 a higher variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 as well.
 We wish to see how different choices in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 Whether we condition on income or not is another issue.

\begin_layout Standard
The filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can be used to standardise the supply conditions for a comparison of demand
 between two disparate economies.
 In the more developed market, one expects to see rental options, availability
 of cheaper substitutes or extension of credit facilities to the consumer
 for an durable good that is too expensive for her.
 This has two effects on the consumer basket.
 First, the difference between successive asset costs in an order of assets
 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{i}=A_{i}-A_{i-1}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula ${A_{i}}={A_{1}<A_{2}<A_{3}}$
\end_inset

) would be lower in the more developed market because the market would make
 cheaper alternatives available to the consumer.
 Second, the a lot of assets can be availed without ownership in the developed
 market.
 To consider a particular example of car ownership, we would see both that
 the cars can be enjoyed with a frequent non-durable cost (rental) rather
 than through ownership and that the cars are available in a wider range
 of costs in the developed market.
 Standardsing the supply conditions in the two economies with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 would thus have a less discrete distribution of assets in the developed
 market (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 that was solved for the simulation in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 into the Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:nonstoch"

\end_inset

.
 But both the options would be susceptible to the measurement errors associated
 with the ownership and inter-generational transfer of assets- which serve
 as an input to either of these forms.
 Empirically, a long-term asset for a particular household is any good that
 has an expected lifetime long enough to be passed on to the owner's progeny.
 Based on our arguments detailed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"

\end_inset

, a good that can't be passed on isn't long-term for the purposes of the
 current model and would not cause any observable change in the expected
 social mobility.
 Such consumption (inclusive of any status consumption through quality)
 is considered non-durable for our purposes and would not serve as an input
 to the process 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 - which returns only maintenance fees, rents or running costs associated
 with the ownership of long-term assets.
 As status utility to the consumer comprises both of the non-durable consumption
 and the owned assets, the constraints such as maintenance fees or running
 costs can only contribute indirectly to status through the ownership of
 assets that impose such constraints on the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to estimate the non-durable consumption costs necessitated through
 assets (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t}.\rho)$
\end_inset

 ) with either of the above methods, we also need to consider the average
 operation for some of the assets.
 A refrigerator - which is expected to run 24 hrs a day - would have a different
 electricity requirement and hence the running costs compared to an electrical
 stove or agricultural equipment which is used less sparingly.
 On the other hand, the running costs for entertainment boats or musical
 equipment - whose running time is controlled by the user and is associated
 with leisure - are not considered part of the quality constraint.
 Other than the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, the price filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 also depends on the personal characteristics which may impose a certain
 lifestyle or habit on the consumer.
 For example, the consumers living in a remote area may have a zero consumption
 for certain commodities (
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 for a certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 These discrete effects cannot be modeled when using the approximation of
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $mA_{t}^{a}$
\end_inset

 in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, for the regression to estimate the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha/\beta$
\end_inset

, we permit the summation of qualities control variables across commodities.
 Thus, given 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 categories (e.g.
 food, energy etc.), if we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1,t}=\nu_{1}mA_{t-1}^{a}i_{t-1}\eta_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2,t}=\nu_{2}mA_{t-1}^{a}i_{t-1}\eta_{t-1}$

 It's only when we use a dynamic model for making these choices - i.e.
 whether a consumer could move to a different locality, buy a house etc.

 Since we consider

 We only consider the

 we assume that consumer purchases an asset as soon has she has accumulated

 In our case, whether the consumer saves for purchasing an asset or not

 to purchase and asset or not.
 The asset states that the consumer enters in are - the low band, the medium-low

 order we have talked about in the previous sections.

Let the utility of the consumer be 
\begin_inset Formula $U(A,\kappa,\eta)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 represents the needs of the consumer.
 A key argument here is that the tendency to expand one's needs also adds
 to the felicity (utility) of the consumer.
 That the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 should be parameters with respect to which the 
\begin_inset Formula $U(A,\kappa,\eta)$
\end_inset

 is non-decreasing, needs little explanation but the argument that utility
 also increases with respect to needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 relies on the life-cycle hypothesis - which considers how an individual
 obtains a stable income before expanding her family and sheds off assets
 acquired over the active years - enabling the further generations to replicate
 that same behaviour.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 as non-stochastic components and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 as the stochastic components imply a model where consumer makes the discrete
 choice of purchasing an asset while getting a non-stochastic utility from
 quality of consumption.
 An individual who considers two choices 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{1},\kappa_{1},\eta_{1})$

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that our notion of quality is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality of life
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in general - but simply the quality of non-durable consumption.
 The differences in quality of assets can also exist for the consumer but
 we recognise that owned assets are of less importance within certain commodity
 groups (see condition C1).
 To quantify some of these notions of life-style choices through quality
 and assets, we now outline a model for intertemporal choice that would
 be developed further in later sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a long-term direct utility that the consumer optimises such
 that it is a function of the needs, the assets she possesses and the quality
 of her non-durable consumption.
 Considering two consumers in the urban and rural areas with the assets,
 quality and needs being 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{u},\rho_{u},\eta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{r},\eta)$
\end_inset

 respectively (for simplicity, we have set 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{u}=\eta_{r}=\eta$
\end_inset

), a non-decreasing utility would mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}\Rightarrow u(A_{u},\rho_{u})>u(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

.
 It is also possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

 are not defined since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u},\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

 may not be available to the rural consumer.
 Notice that we don't consider income as an input to the long-term utility.
 This is because we assume that the utility of income is realised with the
 purchases of assets and quality.
 For the urban and the rural consumer, as an example, having a refrigerator
 or a car would be more noticeable than the income itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A non-decreasing utility also implies that for a rural consumer who does
 not possess a refrigerator to have the same utility as her urban counterpart,
 she would have to purchase a higher quality i.e.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{u},)=u(A_{r},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}>\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

.
 While a particular form of this social function 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 may help us understand how a consumer compensates for not having an asset,
 it is the relevance of such choices to the observed consumption data that
 concerns us more in an empirical analysis.
 A utility function that we desire should help us quantitatively explain
 for example - how much more furniture for a rural consumer would make her
 indifferent to owning electrical assets (and less furniture) in an urban
 area.
 It should also explain whether higher priced assets always provide a higher
 long-term utility to a consumer etc..
 With vast differences in income and wealth that exist in many of the developing
 countries, we believe such questions ought to be considered in any discussion
 on consumption of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To model the sharp (discrete) differences in life-style choices and the
 unobservable factors that create them, we introduce an uncertainty in the
 long-term utility - so that our representative consumer who has a higher
 value of owned assets has only a probabilistic higher long-term utility.
 The long-term utility in the model is incremented in a deterministic fashion
 only with the assets that can be transferred over generations (including
 education, language spoken and occupational ranks) while the immediate
 enhancements to felicity, improvement in self-image - all contribute as
 less deterministic factors to the long-term utility.
 Thus our representative consumer may not gain any long-term benefits from
 an immediate felicity and the stochastic factors other than a better self-image
 and social environment which would in turn help her in acquiring assets
 in the longer run.
 We claim that as long as an empirical distinction between quality, needs
 and assets can be made, the consumption of quality would reflect the self-image
 of the consumer - i.e.
 her expectations of a future improvement of the long-term standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an important advantage in the empirical work with the differentiation
 of assets from quality in the above fashion - particularly so if one were
 to extend the notion of long-term utility to status-related consumption.
 While the literature on conspicuous consumption often relies on Veblen's
 futility assumption for conspicuous items - treating status goods as those
 that offer no true utility - our approach may allow all items to contribute
 to status by letting every purchase of any kind improve one's relative
 position in the society.
 A good would contribute to utility by offering i) an immediate benefit
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(\eta)$
\end_inset

 ii) an expectation of self-improvement 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho)$
\end_inset

 and iii) a definite long-term improvement in wealth or security 
\begin_inset Formula $(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The researcher can associate certain items to the respective groups for
 each of these functions (
\begin_inset Formula $A,\eta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) while the model's representative consumers ought to either attain higher
 wealth (income) through long-term assets or increase the felicity and the
 expectation of stable high-income through higher non-durable consumption.
 In an equilibrium, the consumers would stay at a quality consumption level
 just equivalent to the perceived probability of promotion - as the deterministi
c part of their long-term utility is provided by owned transferable assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model above is indeed a simplistic one since it treats a population
 with more focus on quality as the one participating in more conspicuous
 consumption.
 However, we must emphasise that the above approach relies on the notions
 of quality, need and assets - ideas that vary across geographies and require
 some subjective judgment.
 It would be hardly appropriate - for example - to consider sundry electrical
 items as assets in a developed economy.
 The ability of a market to differentiate items within a commodity also
 influences a particular view of model's long-term utility (more quality
 is on offer in some markets than others).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a model for a risky long-term utility, we can now return to comparing
 the rural and the urban consumers.
 It is possible that the rural consumer not having the refrigerator believes
 that she isn't far away from having one by enhancing her social network
 and obtaining higher ranking within her own locality.
 Urban life does not need to imply a necessarily better life-style but it
 does provide an increased possibility of access to industrial goods - such
 as electrical items.
 Further, if the consumer is amongst the poor in a rural area (lower ranking
 due to assets) and consumes less quality, then she may have little to lose
 by moving to the urban area - where the assets may be lower, but the perceived
 probabilities of transition are higher due to higher population and increased
 qualities (availability of new assets).
 There is an upfront cost to pay - possibly with a loss of assets or quality
 in other areas - but it isn't reflected in the differences in cost of assets
 alone.
 Instead, an increased perceived probability (quality) also has a role to
 play in the long-term utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, if it is possible to model the acquisition of assets over
 time, an intertemporal setting could further enhance our understanding
 of how quality of expenditure changes over time - allowing us to provide
 more robust insights on how long-term utility inclusive of status is indicated
 through consumption - which we view as a combination of quality in commodities
 and acquisition of long-term assets.
 To motivate a discrete model for consumer choice, we now provide a multinomial
 logit analysis of quality against assets owned.

APPENDIX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In absence of the additivity assumption, a two-way substitution is implied
 - first, across commodities and second, across qualities variants within
 a commodity.
 Consider a two commodity-group world where prices are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{1}^{2},p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for commodity group 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{1},p_{2}^{2},p_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for commodity group 2.
 Assuming the price are in an ascending order, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{2}^{1}$
\end_inset

 are the prices of the cheapest commodity in each group.
 Assume for a moment that the consumer's income remains constant.
 Now if price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 increases and the quantities consumed of the item with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 remain the same, then for the total expenditure in group 1 (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

) to remain the same, the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 must decline (i.e.
 less of the items with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be consumed).
 If the consumer doesn't decrease the quantities consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1},q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=p_{1}^{1}q_{1}^{1}+p_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{3}q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 would increase due to rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer must adjust 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=p_{2}^{1}q_{2}^{1}+p_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{3}q_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - since her total outlay remains the same.
 It would be possible, therefore, that the consumer spends less on food
 overall - for example - to support her energy needs.
 The switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 would be the 
\series bold
first-level 
\series default
of substitution and the switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would constitute the 
\series bold
second-level 
\series default
of substitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When additivity assumption cannot be used, two assumptions can simply the
 model - first that every commodity group is either i) one where LTDG dominate
 and quality variation does not exist or ii) LTDG don't exist and quality
 variation exists.
 With that assumption, consider that the commodity group 2 is comprised
 only of elementary goods with just one price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and a set of long-term durable goods whose price is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

>>
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 (LTDG) .
 In that case, the second-level of substitution would be applicable only
 for group 1 and the second-level of substitution would be driven only by
 the savings for the long-term durable good in the group 2 (with price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 Thus, certain commodity groups being dominated by LTDG and others by ENDC
 associate the first-level of substitution with the LTDG ownership in the
 model.
 An implicit assumption here is also that acquiring LTDG is always more
 expensive than engaging in ENDC - the quality differences within ENDC always
 matter more in short-term than the quality variation within LTDG.
 For example, if several types of cars exist in the transport commodity
 group as do the limousine companies for a taxi-commute, then without the
 implicit assumption one risks ignoring the quality variation in types of
 cars.
