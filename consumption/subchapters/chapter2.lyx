\begin_layout Title
Status consumption under extreme asset differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
While status consumption is assumed to be ubiquitous, the possibility that
 extreme wealth inequalities in an economy could discourage status comparisons
 across reference groups separated by wealth has been explored less often.
 Comparing non-durable consumption in two sub-Saharan African developing
 economies, we explore the opposing effects of peer influences and extreme
 wealth differences on non-durable consumption.
 Using the LSMS data from Tanzania and Nigeria, we estimate the extent to
 which the non-durable consumption relevant for status indication may be
 segregated by asset ownership levels in the two economies.

Research goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the proposed chapter is to find out whether in an environment
 of wealth disparities, the consumers i) rule out status comparisons beyond
 their immediate reference groups (leading to status competitions that are
 essentially non-overlapping) or instead ii) substitute being in a poorer
 reference group (having less assets) with high status consumption?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assess this empirically by comparing the non-durable consumption and
 long-term assets in Tanzania and Nigeria - the two developing economies
 in sub-Saharan Africa.
 We test in particular if the consumers in richer references consumer less
 or more non-durable consumption relative to their needs.
 We also comment if in the specific context of urbanisation-related developments
, status consumption could be largely an appeal for urbanisation in the
 poorest sections of the developing economies.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%[Fundamental Needs are the same for the rich] We use the view of status
 as a context driven utility from consumption and wealth to argue also that
 the richer consumers do not have fundamentally different needs - but context-dr
iven costs of status indication.
 The reference dependent status consumption implies that there exists universal
 need of status consumption - but not that the fundamental needs themselves
 are higher for a richer consumer.
 For example, a rich neighborhood having high prices of food does not mean
 that the needs for food are costlier for the richer consumer (if that was
 true, an arbitrageur would take advantage to offer cheaper prices for food
 with the difference in prices for food explained accounted only by costs
 of transportation).
 If we can admit that consumers optimise life-style choices and goals higher
 than nutrition, then the higher costs on food are likely to be be intertwined
 with long-term choices of the consumer (which force her to be a neighborhood
 with higher food prices).
 More expenses on fundamental needs might be a consequence of availing higher
 status - rather than having different needs per se (this is explained by
 Maliath as non-transactional optimisations).

 We find two issues with the approach in the context of developing economies.
 First, in a population where the majority lives at subsistence level, the
 consumption of non-visible goods may also be indicative of status.
 Second, there may be long-term assets that both serve necessities and indicate
 status.
 While these effects are of little significance in relatively equal societies
 with strong institutions for social welfare, they are of importance in
 understanding status consumption in the developing economies where most
 consumers have few long-term assets and struggle with meeting basic needs.

 Is there even status consumption? 2.
 How does it compare relative to long-term assets] In the particular context
 of sub-Saharan African, even though the rapid economic development tempts
 one to draw parallels with Veblen's ideas of conspicuous consumption from
 the 19th century North America, the limited mobility available to the masses
 in developing economies often presents a landscape different from that
 of America's gilded age (see Ustuner et al.

 view of status consumption).
 More particularly, the options for conspicuous consumption are limited
 to a very small part of the population in the environment of nascent economic
 growth in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The two fold question is - does status consumption exists? if so - how
 does it vary dependeing on the long-term assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Our notion] Observing the consumption microdata, we find a notion of status
 consumption that is general enough to encompass the interactions and consumptio
n of the majority of consumers is more appropriately interpreted as high
 quality in overall non-durable consumption than notions of visibility.
 More specifically, we view status consumption as the expenditure on non-durable
 consumption made to overcome the role of long-term assets and demographic
 characteristics such as education, class or region associated with the
 household.
 The long-term assets are not considered the part of status consumption
 in this approach.
 The argument relies on status being shaped by two components.
 First is the stable component that stays unchanged in the short-term.
 This component includes long-established states e.g.
 education, occupation, ancestral social roles and long-term assets.
 The second component - the consumption that may offset the wide differences
 created by the first component - is what we measure as status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Removal of asset costs] To separate the two components in empirical terms,
 we classify non-durable consumption in two parts - first that is needed
 only when a certain asset or asset level is acquired by the consumer.
 The other component is one that is non dependent on having an asset.
 The assets owned by the consumers in the area where consumer resides then
 serve as her reference group.
 We're interested in finding out if neighbourhoods with high assets spend
 systematically less or more on the non-durable consumption excluding assets.
 If the assets are concentrated into a few regions, then the non-durable
 consumption may offer a clear segregation of status competition - where
 consumers in poorer regions cannot enter into a status comparison with
 the richer regions.
 However, a relatively equal distribution of long-term assets may bring
 a higher appeal for status consumption since both .
 We explore how having more assets changes changes the non-durable consumption
 - particularly the food compeonent vs non-food compeonent in a developing
 country.
 - [ the extreme differences do limit status consumption and use of long-term
 asset possessions in relation to status particularly important in developing
 economies.
 These differences we believe - should be considered in the measurement
 of status consumption in developing economies.

[Status should not be a paradox ] The notion of status most commonly used
 in literature - where it is seen as a static long-term characteristics
 of the consumer - however presents an obvious paradox with respect to consumpti
on since there cannot be any utility from status-consumption if status were
 only accumulated over a long-term.
 The admission that status is subject to change with consumption - just
 the way it is shaped by income or education - trivially resolves the paradox
 (see Michelson et al.

 where a ranking order of wealth inclusive of durable goods is altered by
 the consumer with non-durable or non-inheritable consumption.
 Thus a consumer achieves status utility through consumption with the hope
 and display of moving upwards in a ranking order that is otherwise determined
 by wealth.
 This is improved by a sense of excess consumption i.e.
 the consumption in excess of one's needs determined by the biological setup
 (number of family members, age) and the level of assets.

 Particularly in the context of a developing country, we argue that the
 status-indicating goods need not be the same as those that are considered
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed economies.
 Instead the wealth differences - the necessary context of status consumption
 - may be far too wide for the limited visible items in the developing economies
 to matter.
 Thus we view the non-durable consumption excluding the costs implied by
 a certain asset-ownership level as the measure of an excess consumption
 that result in status advantage to the consumer.
 Thus, the wealth bands are defined using the
\shape italic
 long-term possessions
\shape default
 of the consumer (the stock of durable goods possessed by consumer - inclusive
 of housing, land and other long-term assets that can be inherited) while
 the 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
non-durable consumption which help the perception of higher status are simply
 consumption in excess of needs implied by the wealth band and the other
 household characteristics (e.g.
 number of members, the ages, location etc.).
 The underlying assumption is that the fulfillment of basic needs itself
 does not offer an advantage to the consumer in a status competition - and
 therefore a consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) would have a higher status than another consumer with same needs
 who consumes less.
 This general definition we believe is necessary for a view of status consumptio

 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the

 A starch diet fulfilling the set of

- our requirements of measuring consumption in the context of status is
 met by view consumption against needs imposed by the biological needs and
 the needs imposed by having a certain level of assets (land, housing, agricultu
ral assets etc.).
 Consider the needs of lodging/home-ownership or the primary education of
 children in the area where a consumer resides.
 The costs incurred by living a particular area consists of costs that are
 associated with owned goods and the costs imposed by number of family members,
 children etc..
 Any peer effects not implied by the total asset possession of the consumer
 household influence the consumer's choice of non-durable consumption after
 removing the costs implied by having a certain level of assets.

 Here, a survey typically asks the consumers to sort or identify the items
 for consumption based on how they indicate status visually (i.e.
 by a consumer associating status to a consumer owning the particular item).
 While items associated with basic needs are sorted lower by participants,
 an implicit assumption in such questionnaires is that the consumer observes
 the entire spectrum of items available to her regardless of whether she
 may afford them or not.
 The possibility that certain reference groups may view items not

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to other groups as indicative of status or that certain items may be completely
 ruled out for some reference groups is generally not considered in such
 surveys in developed economies.
 In the context of developing countries, some authors (see Khamis et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 ) have extended the surveys by asking the participants for the relative
 income which the consumer they associate with a certain visible item.
 To address the possibility that income differences may segregate status
 competitions, we consider a generic view of non-durable consumption relative
 to long-term needs (inclusive of asset ownership) to explain how consumption
 for status may vary across the population in a developing economy.

\begin_layout Standard
While the intertemporal substitution framework has been widely used in consumer
 economics, its applications in status consumption have been limited.
 The unavailability of brand variety in the data and the often insufficient
 prices of supposed status goods restrict the applications using intertemporal
 substitution.
 The peculiar characteristic of a status item wherein it both indicates
 a rich consumer's exclusive status and creates bandwagons for the poorer
 consumer also poses a challenge - if the demand for status items is always
 set to grow for all consumers as they acquire more assets, then there is
 little substitution between savings and status consumption.
 The intertemporal approach thus seems to be of little use unless one is
 able to track the varying contexts of the consumers as they acquire more
 assets.
 In the proposed chapter, we use a particular dataset on ownership of long-term
 assets along side with the consumption diary to infer the context of status
 consumption in a developing economy.
 Using a model that assumes status to be implied by long-term durable goods
 and modified by local relative advantage in non-durable consumption, we
 examine how the demand for non-durable consumption in relative to one's
 needs varies across disparate regions in two economies in sub-Saharan Africa.

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, we view status consumption as the expenditure on non-durable
 consumption made to overcome the role of long-term assets and demographic
 characteristics such as education, class or region associated with the

 The long-term assets are not considered the part of status consumption
 in this approach.
 The argument relies on status being shaped by two components.
 First is the stable component that stays unchanged in the short-term.
 This component includes long-established states e.g.
 education, occupation, ancestral social roles and long-term assets.
 The second component - the consumption that may offset the wide differences
 created by the first component - is what we measure as status consumption.
 The differences among the consumers with different long-term assets in
 terms of the non-durable consumption plus the small non-inheritable assets
 provide us a way to measure the status consumption in the current chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we compare the non-durable consumption in the two economies and comment
 on the relative importance of status consumption, the notion of a status
 reference group is key to our understanding of the consumer's context.
 Reference groups effectively help us pin down a certain level of status
 consumption as the consumer's social need.
 They also allow us to answer if the not-so-rich spend disproportionately
 higher on status items in an economy or if the high spending on status
 goods is limited to the rich.
 Here, unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary
 emulation (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative
 - reference groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions
 where a consumer identifies her status.
 This is of critical importance since the consumer's social need for status
 is hardly as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.

In the proposed model, reference groups are interpreted as the level of

With a level of needs fixed, there are the only two ways in which a consumer
 can achieve status - either by increasing her asset ownership or improving
 her non-durable consumption excluding costs of maintaining assets.
 A consumer in a richer asset-ownership reference - who may have higher
 needs (which we assess with the asset-related costs in data) - would only
 be concerned with the level of non-durable consumption (excluding asset-mainten
ance costs) within her own reference rather than with the level in the poorer
 reference where either or both of non-durable consumption and asset-ownership
 could be lower.
 Within the asset-ownership reference, therefore, the consumers are meant
 compete only with non-durable consumption

 The choice exercised by the consumer is that of choosing a particular higher

 The issue with this appraoch is that somebody with sigificant assets may

 consumers with no assets also have needs determined by r_t - which is different

% What's not clear is the reason why we are ignoring A on the RHS.
 We're saying that individual consumption levels of non-durable consumption
 should be related to average non-durable consumption and overall assets.
 Using an XT model, one can check whether consumers respond to changes in
 asset values in the area or change in net non-durable consumption (or in
 all consumption).
 A comparison of all consumption vs all non-durable consumption in XT model
 is unnecessary because we assume a cost-structure Psi(r)- suggesting that
 asset-costs are already considered with assets.
 The theoretical justification of the averages are that they are prices
 - of needs (whether basic-food or all-food depends on the availability
 of non-foods prices and the measurement erros by mixing) of asset-maintenance.
 The substitution between asset-costs, needs and nde can be considered -
 so the averages of assets (the role of r), price of needs (average food)
 and (average nde) can then be considered.
 Without AIDS, we can just take q_nde as dependent variable and then consider
 prices (averages) as independent variables.
 Care should be taken on how this corresponds to the model stated in the
 chapter.
 The average of basic-needs + asset costs makes sense, but then we need
 to explain that r_t (price of richness) comprises both of an average needs
 (price) component and an average assets (price) component.
 This also explains that logx - which is not an average and an individual
 value - must remain as independent variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% So in summary, the only substitution we want to present is between nu
 and r_t.
 If we were to use AIDS (let's say), then the weight would be of total asset-cos
ts and nde (not needs).
 The total costs we care about is therefore also just the sum of asset_costs
 (energy, transport) and nu (food, household).
 instead of asset-cost averages we use asset-price-averages and instead
 of price of food+household - we use the total price of food+household (thats'
 the average nde).
 High assets_costs + nu .
 When use q_nde as dependent variable occupation could be used as an instrument.

Non-durable consumption excluding asset-costs

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption items in the LSMS survey are classified under four broad
 categories - food, energy, transport and household.
 Except food and household consumption, we consider the expenditure on energy
 and transport as costs of maintaining a certain level of assets (car, refrigera
tor, heater etc.).
 The classification is presented in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT

 for Nigeria.
 The reason for this treatment of asset-bearing costs (e.g.
 energy- and transport-related costs) is merely the avoidance of double-counting
 of the role of assets in status comparisons while considering non-durable
 consumption.
 Consider for example the comparison of statuses for two consumers of which
 only one owns a motorcycle.
 Here, we do not need to compare how much petrol they've purchased when
 we've already taken into account the difference in their transportation-related
 asset(s).
 As energy and transport related assets are already considered as part of
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer, the costs associated with energy and transport must be
 excluded from the notion of non-durable consumption relevant for signaling.
 Thus the only non-food relevant expenditure for status that we measure
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 excludes the costs implied by the assets owned by the consumer.
 The items over which the expenditure is aggregated to arrive at total non-durab
le consumption excluding asset-costs

 (in a given year

 This is akin to the unit-value method for prices used in the consumer demand
 literature that we use only to observe the average costs for non-durable
 consumption in the consumer's locality.
 The prices or average 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t}),p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$

 The durable goods recorded in the LSMS survey range from short-term durable
 items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such
 as land or houses.
 Of these, we are interested only in the long-term assets that can be transferre
d over generations - accumulations that encompass the notion of asset-richness.
 The assets transferred over a generation are readily verified by inspecting
 households in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit

\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Other than the 4-

 the population mass in the consumer's.
 Such a population-adjusted distance -
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta_{AB}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}$

 is the population resident with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$

- would be shorter for denser areas but larger for sparser populations (represen
ting a smaller reference for consumers despite being spread over a larger
 geographical area).
 We have not however obtained significant differences in the results with
 such a population-adjusted metric after using the census data.
 This could be both because of the coarse granularity of our reference boundarie
s (district level) and the district boundaries already being wider in the
 rural regions (with only a few exceptions such as Sumbawanga and Nkasi
 in Rukwa which we consider within the same reference on grounds of proximity
 in Euclidean distance).

 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the

 A constraint that the aggregation into

 and consumption-averages also impose is that the number of observed households
 within the reference boundary should be high enough to average out the
 idiosyncratic effects and issues related to seasonality of data-capture
 (e.g.
 less electricity needed in winter etc.).
 For this reason, we've made sure that no districts with less than 10 observatio
ns per year are included in our analyses.

\begin_layout Section
Empirical Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal of our empirical analysis is to find the extent to which
 the non-durable expenditure excluding asset costs - after accounting for
 income - is influenced by local asset-ownership levels and the local non-durabl
e consumption level in the two countries.
 If only asset-levels determine the non-durable consumption level in an
 economy, then that would imply a segregation of non-durable consumption
 based on asset-richness.
 If on the other hand, the effect of asset-richness on non-durable consumption
 is weak compared to the the local averages of non-durable consumption,
 the non-durable consumption is likely to be driven by the local levels
 of consumption.
 Likewise, when neither the local non-durable consumption averages nor the
 local asset-averages are significant for the individual's consumption after
 accounting for income, then the non-durable consumption is predominantly
 driven by the income of the individual and the different clusters of income
 and assets are spread uniformly across the regions (over which we calculated
 local averages).
 Lastly, when non-durable consumption is influenced both by local asset-averages
 and local-non-durable consumption averages in the local areas then the
 non-durable consumption patterns are clustered both according to levels
 of asset and regional costs of non-durable consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 When the needs for food quality are not met for the majority of a population,
 social interactions are likely to reveal consumers who can afford better
 food quality from those who can't.
 The attainment of higher food quality would - in other words - be visible
 enough in a poor economy and should be considered a part of non-durable
 consumption relevant for status.
 To take a specific example, when only a small part of the population has
 access to electricity (e.g.
 about 10% in Tanzania), the improvement of food quality through having
 a refrigerator is a luxury that cannot be considered as a mere basic need
 for the consumer.

We use the food and non-food budget shares to understand the role long-term
 assets on non-food non-durable consumption.
 The consumer income used in the analysis is proxied with the total per-expendit
ure including all expenses (asset costs, food, non-food expenses).
 We also see how the total food and non-food non-durable consumption values
 vary across assets.
 Here, as mentioned before, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t}),p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 are the local averages of food and non-food non-durable expenditures (excluding
 asset costs) in the area surrounding the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the local asset-ownership level in the area (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have mentioned before, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not include the cost of owning and maintaining assets since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 already includes the contribution of assets to one's status.
 As a consumer does not choose the maintenance of assets separately from
 choosing to purchase the asset, the idea that a representative consumer
 increases her non-durable consumption excluding asset costs (NDCexAC) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 by availing a higher quality or quantity than necessary makes sense only
 if we exclude the costs imposed on the consumer due to having bought certain
 assets (through maintenance, repair, fees etc.) from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The average 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 thus also excludes the cost of maintaining assets.
 The status advantage that the consumer gets from being in an asset-rich
 neighborhood is meant to be measured with both 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - with a possible substitution between the two.

While the overall poverty levels may be similar in Nigeria and Tanzania,
 the extreme differences in Tanzania (particularly between the south of
 the country and the east) are in contrast with those in Nigeria.
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 In Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) , on the other hand, the income-disparities in occupations and asset-differenc
es seem less extreme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The range of occupations available to the consumer populations in the surveys
 from Tanzania and Nigeria are varied.
 To compare the role of occupations in the two economies, we standardise
 all the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria into
 occupation ranks ranging from 0 to 3.
 The occupation ranks are essentially based on sorting the varied occupations
 in the two economies by the income of consumers in the respective countries.
 The occupation-ranks mapped from the occupation levels in Tanzania and
 Nigeria are presented in Table

In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this the sparsity of income data.
 In the LSMS data used for Nigeria and Tanzania, the income data is not
 available for the entire survey population.
 This is partly due to significant informal sectors in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 for Nigeria).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regional disparities in economic conditions and population density provide
 a particular context to status differences in the economy - as the disparity
 in services as well as amenities across the country have strong implications
 for any consumption deemed status-related.
 A key interpretation of our model for status consumption is that status
 competitions are essentially non-overlapping between two groups of consumers
 when one has both extremely low asset-levels compared to the other and
 extremely low non-durable consumption levels as well.
 In other words, a consumer cannot be in a status competition with another
 consumer when she has both lower level of asset-richness and inferior (or
 deficient) non-durable consumption as well.
 With the south of Tanzania not having nearly the same level of electricity
 consumption nor comparable durable goods associated with electricity as
 the east of Tanzania, the non-durable consumption from the consumers in
 south of Tanzania is hardly in reference to the consumers in urban east
 of Tanzania.
 We use the parametric analysis to test for this effect in Tanzania and
 Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status concerns are necessarily localised, the non-durable consumption
 for consumers in the asset poor south and west are indeed much lower.
 On the other hand, despite lower incomes in the central north, the median
 net-asset worth of the individuals in regions such as Singida and Manyara
 could match up with that of the consumers in the east coast of Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 With the average asset-values and food average costs relatively more aligned
 in the central and eastern regions, the occupational/asset differences
 and non-durable consumption are more comparable between the two regions
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In Tanzania, where we have data on subjective well-being for individuals,
 we also find that eastern regions have much higher perceptions and non-durable
 consumption excluding asset costs as well as high value of assets compared
 to central areas.
 Still, the consumers in southern regions have relatively higher reported
 satisfaction levels than the centre.
 While poverty may not influence subjective well-being so much in Tanzania,
 it cannot be ruled out that the poor are not in the same status competition
 as the rich.
 Not having a similar detail for Nigeria in the LSMS survey prevents us
 from comparing subjective well being data in the two economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the regional disparities, they appear less extreme in Nigeria even
 though the southern areas of the country seem to have more higher-paid
 occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Despite the differences in educational and occupational levels in between
 the north and south of the country, the disparity in asset ownership is
 not nearly as extreme as in Tanzania.
 The implications of this uniformity on non-durable consumption is discussed
 using a parametric approach in the Section

 rises with averages of per-head food expenditures and falls per-head non-food

[Segregation - are we observing it?] That status is shaped by both non-durable
 consumption excluding asset costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the long-term characteristics/ assets allows us to argue that extreme
 asset-differences may not be overcome with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in status competitions.
 Two further implications follow if there are no reported assets for a vast
 majority of the population - first, that the status competitions are not
 feasible between two groups if they are separated by region or social barriers
 leading to extreme asset differences.
 Second, non-durable consumption (including food) must carry status relevant
 to comparisons among consumers with no-reported assets.
 As the extreme differences in assets - be it through social or geographical
 barriers - imply differentiated social contexts, the status competitions
 among consumer groups where extreme asset differences exist must undergo
 a separation of reference groups.
 The differences in status consumption patterns implied by such a separation
 is what we have set ourselves to measure as effects of extreme asset-difference
s on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

Here, while the urban settings would always have higher assets and higher
 non-durable consumption opportunities overall, our intention in a cross-country
 comparison is to measure how extreme these differences are in the two economies.
 Asset bands provide us the needed reference-point which we use to argue
 for the presence of a segregation in competitions when asset-differences
 are wide.
 Thus, while status competition are evidently more predominant in cities
 (developing and developed economies alike), the urban-rural differences
 in assets are less extreme in the developed economies and a substitution
 between owning assets and non-durable consumption follows.
 Our model quantifies how this changes in developing economies where there
 is a significant number of households at subsistence level with very little
 asset possessions.
 The extreme differences in urban and rural areas leading to such a segmentation
 of habits must appear as a higher significance of local-level asset-possession
 on one's non-durable consumption excluding assets costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[List of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

] Therefore we compare both the non-durable consumption

\end_inset

 itself in the two countries and evaluated how extreme asset differences
 and the regional barriers causing scarcities may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the two economies.
 While a significant population in both the economies spends a larger budget
 share on food, the overall non-durable consumption is largely comparable
 for Tanzania and Nigeria.
 However, we also find that the more uniformly distributed assets in Nigeria
 imply that long-term asset ownership has a more significant role towards
 status (in Nigeria).
 More non-durable comprises of non-food component in Nigeria than in Tanzania
 and the food quality seems more segregated across rural and urban regions
 in Tanzania than in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[List of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

] The substitution between having more assets and having high non-durable
 consumption is higher in Nigeria - where the younger consumers seem to
 acquire assets over years and reduce non-durable consumption excluding
 asset-costs as they grow older and/or richer.
 In Tanzania, on the other hand, the substitution between owning assets
 and non-durable consumption is limited.
 That the needs don't scale up non-durable consumption as much in Tanzania
 suggests a squeeze on the total non-durable expenditures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[List of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

] Similarly, while the differences in non-durable consumption between medium
 occupations and low occupations is relatively less in both the economies
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is higher for highest occupations for both Nigeria and Tanzania), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is also more sensitive to asset-accumulation in Tanzania.
 The extreme differences in wealth imply a less overlapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and therefore a more segmented status competition in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Summary] Two takeaways: the effect extreme asset-differences in a developing
 economy too often come with significant differences in non-durable consumption
 as well - underpinning a separation  of demand for non-durable consumption
 above needs that may indicate status.
 We find i) that the extreme differences do limit status consumption and
 ii) that the sense of status in the developing economies is incomplete
 without the consideration of differences in long-term asset possessions.

 Interpretations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 1.
 C5 says that higher price-non-food-expenditure suppresses w_food (individuals
 would decrease w_food when there is higher non-food area - so they move
 together with the food consumption).
 higher-price-food-expenditure on the other hand increases food weight (meaning
 consumers run to food when prices are higher).
 C6 suggests that consumers run to food more easily in TNZ - thus indicating
 more non-durable consumption in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 2.
 C3 says that older households have higher food consumption.
 C7 means that bigger households tend to have lower w_food than smaller
 households.
 Younger households have less w_food - meaning more non-durable consumption
 among younger people in both countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 3.
 D5 says high-food-expenditure-regions have lower non-durable consumption
 (again because food is more important).
 D5 also says that high-non-food-expenditure regions have a positive influence
 so the consumption does move together for non-food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 4.
 D2 says that asset-differences have a -ve influence on w_nonfood.
 Richer areas suppress non-food expenditure a lot in Tanzania.
 Urban areas actually push people to food.
