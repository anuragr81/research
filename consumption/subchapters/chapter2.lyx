The participation rates for secondary and higher education remain one of
 the lowest in many sub-Saharan African economies.
 Tertiary education - in particular - has remained inaccessible to a large
 population and fails to provide adequate employment to those who do acquire
 it (see

 Not only is education is less accessible, it is also seems unable to provide
 for mobility only to those who aren't wealthy (

 The policy interest in addressing the inequalities in education motivates
 our investigation of the effects of the consumer's permanent income and
 the regional wealth inequalities on education expenditure in two representative
 sub-Saharan African economies - Tanzania and Nigeria - in the current chapter.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long-term effects of education on economic growth and the limitations
 that income inequalities pose to accessing education have been of immense
 interest to policy at least since the mid-last century (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,TilakEducationPoverty2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The interest has sparked some heated debates in the literature.
 One of the points of contention has been the relative importance of private
 wealth against that of innate ability on educational performance in schools
 - with many empirical studies reporting that socio-economic status (SES)
 may be of less importance for educational performance in poorer economies
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heynemanloxleyeffect1983"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Another point of contention has been the suggested policy focus on basic
 education rather than higher education.
 We attempt to shed some light on these issues in the context of sub-Saharan
 Africa by exploring how disparities on education expenses (obtained from
 consumption diaries in the Living Standard Measurement Study) across all
 education level may relate with household characteristics, the wealth concentra
tion in the consumer's vicinity and the extent to which education is supported
 by private or religious institutions in Tanzania and Nigeria.

\begin_layout Standard
That education influence income opportunities and future mobility is seldom
 doubted.
 However, the role of parental educational level in the access to education
 (esp higher levels of education) is also found significant in both the
 developed and developing economies.
 As human capital, education level may seem to accumulate similar to assets
 and transferred down to progeny (cite : theoretical model) - creating inequalit
ies similar to asset inequalities.
 More specifically, one finds that wealth plays a significant role in attainment
 of higher education levels in the developing economies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ObasuyiEducationInequality2019,FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc2001,MinnisNonformalEducation2006,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999,GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) with higher intergenerational wealth resulting in higher education levels.
 In the contexts of a developing economies, where industrialisation has
 been recent and is limited to relatively small urban areas, the access
 to education is sparse and is often limited to the urban areas where the
 bulk of employment opportunities for the highly educated reside.
 A segregation basde on wealth as well as urbanisation levels are commonly
 noticed (cite: Wealth Segregation).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand the effect of wealth and its concetration in urban regions,
 our empirical analysis primarily focuses on two controls - the household
 prosperity (wealth effect) and concentration of wealth in the region.
 In this cross sectional analysis, we explore total household expenditure
 on education rather than the intra-household allocation on children.
 To measure the prosperity of the household, we use first the measure of
 permanent income (total expenditure) and then the long-term durable goods
 owned by the households in the consumer's vicinity.
 The permanent income measure is calculated using the total expenditure
 of the consumer household (based on arguments from standard consumption
 theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"

 that are used in much of the literature on status consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace,KausSA,heffetz_visibility,ZahraIndia,ChaiKaus2019,FrieheGermany"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 To measure the concentration of wealth, we use the average long-term durable
 goods owned in the consumer's vicinity apart from the urban-rural indicators
 in the survey.
 The household stock of durable goods are commonly used wealth indices (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HoweHargreavesWealthIndices2008,HoweHargreavesWealthIndexComparison2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The focus on the concentration of long-term durable (i.e.
 assets including land ownership) banks upon the emphasis that sociological
 literature places on the network of occupations and social networks attached
 with assets ownership in sub-Saharan African societies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoseGhebruLandEthiopia2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Further, the inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa are attributed to inequalities
 in factor endowments (such as high land-labour ratios 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersoninequalityandvariableSAA2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) (cite: more about asset inequalities).
 For the measure of urbanisation levels, we intentionally avoid the population
 density based methods - due to problems noted in the literature with highly
 populated rural areas sub-Saharan African economies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hendersonurbanizationSAADifferent2013"

\end_inset

 (cite:).
 Instead, a district with higher number of wards that are recorded as rural
 in the survey are given a higher rural-score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other important controls used in the comparison of educational expenses
 are the education level of the household head, the access to education
 in the district and the agrarian/non-agrarian primary occupation in the
 household.
 The empirical results are used to explain how permanent income, concentration
 of wealth in urban areas in the two economies may account for disparate
 education expenditures.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that the disparities in richness and mobility may have implications
 for migration pressures in the sub-Saharan African economies as well.
 More particularly, if the costs of living and amenities are less varied
 across the economy, then a consumer may be indifferent between staying
 in a poorer area and moving to a richer area with higher relative poverty.
 This indifference changes when the areas of residence are extremely dissimilar
 in terms of opportunities - that often result in asymmetrical human capital
 investments (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corakintergenerationalmobility2004"

\end_inset

) and higher segregation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We do find some evidence of such a segregation in the poorer of the two
 economies i.e.
 Tanzania as we observe the role of permanent income and concentration of
 wealth.

While education may not be counted as the basic necessities of an individual
 in every poverty-measurement survey, it is seldom disputed that the lack
 of education contributes to the individual's poverty.
 The significance of education is summarised well by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GalbraithBeyondContentment1994"

\end_inset

 suggesting that - there is ‘‘no well educated literate population that
 is poor, [and] there is no illiterate population that is other than poor’’.
 Even the poorest individuals seem to have a strong demand for education.
 The literature for the developing economies also confirms a significant
 willingness to pay for education among the poor - 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002"

 If anything, there seems to be a compulsion to pay for education among
 the poor when education is not state-funded - 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002"

 It is not surprising thus that despite the fierce debates on public expenditure
 for education, both the human capital perspective (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

The policy discussions on the choice between provision of free basic education
 to all (at the point of use) and investments in higher education have entailed
 some of the most heated debates on education in developing economies (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanLDCOECDSchoolAchievements1980"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Those proposing the prioritisation of basic education point out that the
 role of primary and secondary education has been more important for growth
 in LDC nations than in OECD economies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "petrakisgrowtheduc2002"

\end_inset

) and that the contribution of higher educational levels should increase
 gradually as the level of development increases (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "petrakisgrowtheduc2002,PsacharopoulosFinancingEducLDC1986"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 It has also been recommended (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsacharopoulosFinancingEducLDC1986"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) that public finance should be diverted from higher education to primary
 education while letting higher education be privately funded.
 Some of the criticism (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - in particular - argues that the positive externalities from education
 are not factored into the productivity measures often used to argue against
 investments in higher education.
 That the individuals benefit culturally and physically from education -
 while reducing the costs of imparting social changes is ignored when using
 a returns-of-education approach.
 It seems that not only does formal education help workers pick up more
 skills on their own (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FullerVocationalTraining1976"

 in the labour market (see

 While the returns-to-education approach is often used to explain the impact
 of education (see

 The literature on sub-Saharan Africa offers two differing views on failures
 in education policy that have resulted in a high unemployment among graduates
 and a relatively low participation of higher education.
 On one hand, the literature suggests institutional problems and mismanagement
 in public education (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"

) that may have led to insufficient gains in economic growth from education.
 On the other hand, it is also suggested that a focus on policy that is
 further from skills needed in an informal economy has resulted in poor
 agricultural productivity (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Studies also find less signifiance of physical access - often emphasising

For the particular contexts of Nigeria and Tanzania, we note that Nigeria
 has had more investments in commodities sector (oil and petroleum) than
 Tanzania - which remains a relatively agrarian economy.
 The policy of education has also been different in the two economies -
 with Tanzania having a history of restrictions of secondary education at
 a time when other countries in the region were expanding their education
 sector (see

 in the two economies is thus subject to these developments in the two economies.

The inequalities in a typical developing economy entail both a wide geographical
 disparity in wealth and more local differences in income.
 In other words, one finds both that some regions of a developing economy
 are much poorer (richer) than others and that extreme income differences
 persist within a particular area.
 The current chapter considers if the disparities in urbanisation levels
 - measured as concentration of higher durable goods that can be transferred
 over generations - affect the educational expenses of a consumer household.

The reason why we consider durable goods transferred over generations is
 that the sense of wealth considered for urbanisation is meant to exclude
 goods consumption that enters the consumption which the educational expenses
 are a part of.
 The averages of assets are calulated at in the consumer's district (for
 smaller districts, the average over multiple districts within a 6-

 The market-value of durable goods (including land, housing) used in the
 average are directly observed in the data (see Section

In the simple econometric model considered in the chapter, the representative
 consumer balances i) increasing her consumption with ii) expenditure on
 education.
 The cross-sectional compairosn of expenseis does not consider the substitution
 with savings towards durable goods.
 Further, the non-durable consumption considered in our analysis excludes
 the expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and other non-durable consumption thus form the
 budget constraint in the consumption.
 Since the selection of educational expense in a particular area of prosperity
 depends on the number of children and the age of the children - we consider
 the role that the household-age and the household-size (number of children)
 play in the education expense.
 The household characteristics such as religion and language spoken are
 also found as relevant controls in the two economies.

Given the recent industrialisation in the sub-Saharan Africa, the dichotomy
 of agrarian and non-agrarian occupations is of particular importance to
 our analyses and is explored in the framework in two different ways.
 First, the effects of being in an agrarian occupation on educational expense
 are compared against those of local concentration of wealth.
 Second, the role of prosperity is considered separately for among the agrarian
 and non-agrarian populations in the consumer's vicinity (immediate geographical
 area

 The first interpretation is one where a simple average of the total assets
 owned by the households in the consumer's district.
 Both education rank and a factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 indicating whether the household head's occupation is agrarian or not are
 used as controls in this interpretation .
 The second interpretation is based on a factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 indicating whether the education level of the household-head is higher
 than primary school or not.
 More specifically, the second interpretation uses the prosperity within
 the educational levels implied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 is also used as the additional control in this second interpretation.
 Finally, the third interpretation is based on the average prosperity in
 the agrarian vs non-agrarian occupations (i.e.

As described earlier, we interpret urbanisation as the asset concentration
 - and measure it simple as the log-averages of the values of durable goods
 (calculated as per the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited through, we focus on durable goodsthat can be transferred over
 a generation.
 For both Tanzania and Nigeria, we therefore included items as long-term
 assets only if they are costlier than furniture - which is the cheapest
 asset to be transferred between the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets

 reported by the consumer with price

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in

 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts for the

 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards

Of the two economies, a higher percent of the GDP comes from agricultural
 production in Tanzania.
 With more reliance on non-agrarian exports, the average education levels
 seem higher in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HistEducationRanks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The role of private education is also much higher in Nigeria (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in both the economies.
 More specifically, urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents
 in Nigeria whereas they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for education rank 3 is almost double that
 of the expenditure on education rank 2 in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these costs rise by about 54%.
 The educational expenses do not seem to rise much with asset disparities
 in Nigeria - whereas they seem to be more unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartEducationbyAssetDeciles"

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing the overall distribution of assets, we see that while the overall
 poverty may appear similar in Nigeria and Tanzania, the disparity in owned
 assets is far more extreme in Tanzania (particularly between the south
 of the country and the east - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for Nigeria and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for Tanzania).
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) whereas the income-disparities in occupations and asset-differences appear
 less extreme in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The inequality in expenditure on non-durable consumption - on the other
 hand - is not as different for the two economies.
 This can be verified with the Lorenz curves for total non-durable expenditure
 and total assets in Figure

 (Nigeria) are based on the standardisation of various occupations in Tanzania
 and Nigeria.
 Since the range of occupations in the surveys from Tanzania and Nigeria
 is varied, the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria
 have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and reporting of
 occupations in the surveys from both the countries

It is not uncommon for the empirical studies to use the data on occupation
 or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) in the context of sub-Saharan Africa.
 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem
 that may be aggravated further because of large informal sectors in the
 economies.

 As described in Section

To understand the urban-rural differences, we compare the fulfillment of
 basic needs in urban vs rural areas using the fraction of consumers that
 have run out of food in the last 12 months in every district across both
 economies (either due to lack of agricultural inputs or high prices) in
 Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 These indicate a significant number of households running out of food in
 urban areas (due to high costs) - even though the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons).
 The average consumer in the urban areas for both the economies - despite
 better options for lifestyle and consumption - seems to struggle with basic
 needs.
 The estimation in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Parametric-Analysis"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 further explores if education expenses are significantly impacted by permanent
 income while quantifying the degree of urbanisation as concentration of
 long-term durable goods rather depending on the rural-urban indicator variable
 alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we undertake a more detailed view on education expenses in the Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Parametric-Analysis"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the key observation from the non-parametric view of the data is that the
 disparities in income and durable goods are more localised in Nigeria while
 they are more extreme across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the disparity in durable-goods ownership across regions is not as extreme
 as in Tanzania.
 The particular interpretation of urbanisation is used to explain the implicatio
ns of this non-uniformity on consumption and educational expenses in Section

 One such variable is the logarithm of total expenditure

 The relationship between total household expenditures and the household’s
 permanent income is comes from standard consumption theory (see

 The controls such as the household's occupational and educational statuses
 are evidently observed at the household level.
 Similarly, the factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 (indicating whether the household head is employed in agriculture related
 occupation or not), the number of children in the household

A goal of the empirical analysis is to find out if the educational expenses
 in the two economies rise more sharply as a result of higher prosperity
 consumer's locality (urbanisation level measured as concentration of long-term
 durable goods) rather the higher permanent income (measured as logairthm
 of total expenditure) and the education rank of the household.
 The empirical results also contrast the relative effects of wider and local

 suggest that an increase in 
\family typewriter
logx 
\family default
- causes a decrease in the the budget share on education 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 This may be largely due to the educational expenses forming a higher proportion
 of the total expenditure for poorer households - so we evaluate the 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 regressions (see Tables 
\begin_inset ERT

 ) which suggest that the education expenditures rise with the increase
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

.
 The higher budget share of education is not solely due to higher urban
 prices in general - since the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

 remains weak on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for both the economies (as urbanisation must also raises the prices of

The higher prosperity of districts (or urbanisation) increases educational
 budget shares in both the countries - but the increases in educational
 expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 drop with rising prosperity for Tanzania whereas they rise for Nigeria
 (see Tables

 This is true for other interpretations of the vicinity i.e.
 
\family typewriter
r_agri
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
r_educ 
\family default
as well (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"

 for definitions).
 The more prosperous regions thus maintain higher expenditures on education
 in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite private education being more important in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the access to private education is limited to the wealthier population
 in both the economies.
 As private education only accounts for a minority of the population (see
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), this seems to confirm the findings that higher education is not provided
 by private institutions in the region.
 The results also indicate a higher rise in secondary and tertiary education
 - if one looks at the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 i.e.

\family typewriter
 meanchildage
\family default
 (average age of the children) on education expenses in the two economies.
 The less surprising observation that more children increase the total expenditu
re is supported for both the economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note also that in Tanzania - with a higher disparity in asset-ownership
 and less urbanisation - the agrarian households seem to be spending higher
 on education (compare the coefficients of

) - esp considering the prosperity of households with the same educational-statu
s (
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 having higher than primary education or not).
 The education expenditure is thus higher for agrarian households in Tanzania
 after taking into account their poor educational status measured through
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 It does seem however, that the urban-rural divide is more significant for
 Tanzania.

The role of social environment is strong in both the economies.
 The role of English language seems significant in Tanzania - where the
 English-speakers spend significantly higher on education.

\begin_layout Standard
We had set ourselves to understand how urbanisation levels may segregate
 education expenses (and thus future mobility) in two economies in the sub-Sahar
an Africa that differ in the level of urbanisation and income disparities.
 The results find significant effects of urbanisation levels - intepreted
 as concentration of durable goods - on education expenses in both the economies.
 The role of permanent income does seem weaker in Nigeria - where urbanisation
 is more likely to cause difference in education expense.
 In Tanzania, on the other hand, the role of permanent income is stronger.
 While private education seems more common in Nigeria, the state-provided
 education plays the dominant role in both the economies.
 It cannot be ruled out that higher urbanisation and the rise in incomes
 as well as education expenses with an expansion of education sector could
 allow private institutions to play a larger role in secondary education
 in either of the economies.

The results highlighting the significance of language and religion share
 the observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"

\end_inset

 - who have highlighted the role of religious and colonial institutions
 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.
 Further, as the agrarian consumers maintain a higher budget share on education
 expenses in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and higher education ranks consistent
ly correspond to higher education expenses in the more developed economy
 (Nigeria), it would appear that the educational expenses remain higher
 after attainment of education by the consumers and increase in regional
 prosperity.
 This seems aligned with the cohort-study from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who suggest that the labour with skills added through education is less
 willing to stay in agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In view of the structural differences in the two economies, the separation
 of opportunities for education and mobility in Tanzania seem strong with
 agrarian occupations lagging far behind relative to the urban areas.
 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the level of urbanisation and access to
 education are generally higher with the differences in education expenditure
 brought about through regional differences and religious institutions.
 There are thus two main conclusions we arrive at using the above results.
 First, the urbanisation - considering the two economies - does appear to
 be strongly associated with higher educational expenses.
