Assets - Basic Idea 
\series default
: This basic framework can also be used to compare the long-term demand
 in developing and the developed economies.
 Since the durable goods (LTDG) have a higher upfront cost compared to the
 quality consumption, the accumulation of durable goods (LTDG) is a clearer
 indicator of the consumer's high expectation of the stability of her income
 (if not a real stability of high income).
 To standardise the LTDG options available to the consumer, we can order
 the LTDG in the respective markets based on their costs of acquisition.
 The differences in the costs of two successive LTDG in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cost-order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for LTDG present the substitutability between acquisition of durable goods
 and quality consumption to the consumer.
 A higher difference between two successive LTDG costs is likely to make
 the consumption of quality more tempting for the consumer - whereas low
 differences would make the acquisition of LTDG easier.
 The differences in successive LTDG costs are indeed a consequence of how
 advanced the markets are in an economy.
 In the developing world, we see that the markets are often too underdeveloped
 to make rental options available for an expensive durable good (LTDG) to
 the consumer, the attempts to develop new (cheaper) substitutes to reach
 to the consumer are often inadequate and there is a near absence of credit
 facilities.
 Hence, the differences between successive LTDG costs relative to average
 income is likely to be higher in the developing world than in the developed
 countries (where markets are more developed and either some credit to purchase
 LTDG or a direct rental of LTDG is made available to consumer)
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is of course - assuming that all products (at whatever cost) can be
 purchased in the developing world.
 The differences between successive LTDG costs would be significantly lower
 if if the consumer baskets are limited in the developing world through
 trade barriers etc..
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The differences in cost-order thus provide us a way to compare the consumer
 markets between the two economies â€“ and thus to compare the demands (EDNC
 vs LTDG) with respect to the differences in the respective markets.
 The criteria of comparison is planned to be used in the later chapters
 for a comparison across countries.

Considering that

, the status that a consumer derives from consumption must come out of either
 elite non-durable consumption or high-priced durable consumption.
 Thus, tracking the two over time (i.e.
 high-quality consumption and the assets owned by the consumers observed
 over time) can help us explain status consumption with the help of a model
 for intertemporal choice under uncertainty over time.
 We therefore intend to measure i) the extent to which the consumers change
 their long-term purchase habits (i.e.
 by making some discrete choices) and ii) the extent to which they choose
 to save for future stocks rather than to overspend on higher quality in
 the current time period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our wider goal is not as much to detail the nuances of status consumption
 as it is to show how status-related consumption could be viewed in a convention
al model for consumer demand.
 An interpretation of status consumption is possible, if we base ourselves
 on the assertion that for status-related consumption to exist, status must
 appear in the long-term utility for the rational consumer in a model.
 In other words, for a rational consumer to spend on status consumption,
 she must see some status utility from consumption in the long-term or the
 short-term.
 We don't attempt to explain to what extent is status a long-term concern
 vs a short-term concern for the consumer.
 Nor do we intend to take an ideological stance on whether status consumption
 is wasteful or a consequence of social mobility.
 Regardless of what items are counted within a certain definition of status
 consumption, we intend to provide tests of whether expensive nondurable
 consumption (ENDC) increases with changes towards industrialisation (as
 seems to be the case when reading Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

) or if ENDC is always used to compensate for not having as much status
 and durable goods (LTDG) as others.
 The change in ENDC with respect to price changes could provide further
 details on the structure of quality demand.
 More particularly, if we can measure the sensitivity of ENDC to price-rises,
 we can better assess whether ENDC moves together with measures of social
 mobility in the economy (i.e.
 purchase of assets or an upward movement in education and occupation for
 a member of the household) or if the different economic strata (classified
 in terms of occupation-rank or education levels) continue to spend differently
 on ENDC in face of price changes.

: Ever since elasticities were first used in demand analysis, the change
 in needs for commodity groups over time has been of interest to econometricians
 and policy makers.
 Here, both the behavioural and classical approaches seem to find some evidence
 for habit formation in the consumer panel data.
 The measurement of the effect of change in habits and quality on the consumer
 price index has had a long tradition (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment) - from within which Muellbauer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."

\end_inset

 has observed that a model for myopia amongst consumers could explain their
 preferences better.
 In more recent studies where a general setting of the intertemporal substitutio
n problem in a life-cycle context has been used, a rational utility-optimising
 consumer can balance between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned and actual savings over her life-time.
 This is the setting explored by a few behavioural approaches (see Shefrin-Thale
r 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

) that have attempted to model the rules of mental accounting used by consumers
 - in order to better understand the conditions that lead to development
 of habits.
 Such models explain the consumers' inertia of choices and allow the representat
ive consumer to be influenced by behavioural factors such as willpower rather
 than letting them become subservient to an optimised plan for life-time
 savings and consumption.
 In what may be seen as a more accurate representation of real-life consumer
 behaviour, the representative consumer in such models is subject to accumulatin
g items that she doesn't need and acquiring habits of consumption she could
 barely afford in the long-term.

 play a role in status-signalling and the way assets are accumulated over

 We note that a behavioural model can incorporate such behaviour with the
 use of reference points (see Markowitz

:A discussion of trends identified in the two threads of literature is possible
 in the context of rapidly-changing developing countries where urban industriali
sation and overpopulation create vast differences in the life-styles between
 urban and rural areas while the status competitions in the society continue
 to thrive.
 Although a detailed time-series of consumption microdata matching the respectiv
e quality in the developed world is hardly available in the developing countries
, a framework for risk preferences can be used to understand the consumer
 demand in the developing countries.
 An important economic model for urban and rural interactions is the Lewis
 model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GollinLRF"

\end_inset

 - which views urban migration as a necessary phase of development - leading
 to a competition between industrial and agricultural sectors for labour
 and food (it predicts the prices of food to rise as labour moves from agricultu
re to industry).
 The worker/farmer is meant to maximise her income and reduce the risk associate
d with it as she is faced with the choice of migration to the urban areas.
 We argue that the flight to urban areas is often not only an escape from
 despondent circumstances but also an access to expanded consumption basket
 and a chance for improbable social mobilities.
 Therefore, a model that accounts for the competition amongst the individuals
 for status or a place in a perceived social order could provide some refinement
 by adding more incentives to the migration.
 Attempts have been in the literature on to associate finer trends in consumptio
n with the interaction between introduction of industrial goods and status
 needs of the consumers.

 Sen

 has attributed this squeeze to the rise in the poverty-level for consumption
 of non-food items.
 From a behavioural economics perspective, this would amount to a change
 in the reference points for non-food consumption.
 An issue with the use of reference points, however, is their measurement
 in the large-scale microdata.
 Unlike in the controlled settings of an experiment, where the reference
 points can be specified more clearly, they are more difficult to justify
 in the consumption microdata.
 But as long as a separation between the bare necessities and luxuries (i.e.
 a reference point for subsistence) can be justified a framework for measurement
 of consumption can be used to understand the change in needs of a society.

 attempt to answer whether prolonged measures of income equality (and therefore
 stagnant ownership of durable goods) can influence conspicuous consumption
 asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes.
 If the macroeconomic factors and issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) can be controlled for
 in the data, then a general model for long-term (or more stable) needs
 against short-term (or more uncertain) needs could explain the demand pressures
 induced by the income differences in both the developed and developing
 economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

:Such a standardisation of demand-influencing factors across the developed
 and the developing would however rest upon a precise definition of the
 long-term utility (inclusive of status) and the consumption associated
 with it.
 Unfortunately the definition for status consumption in the studies we have
 surveyed varies significantly across the social contexts - making the task
 of standardisation nearly impossible.
 For example, some studies include long-term durable goods in the status-related
 items while others don't.
 Others have applied a consumer basket identified from a different economy
 onto the economy being studied.
 Of all the approaches taken towards status consumption we have surveyed,
 we prefer the utility model adopted by Corneo et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 who view snob and bandwagon items as the fundamental types of status goods.
 It is possible - we believe - to link status-related consumption thus defined
 with the consumer decision theory under risk.
 From a behavioural economics perspective, status could encompass the consumer's
 preference to long-term protection and hence a perception of risk associated
 with the promotion to a state of higher income and assets (or any characteristi
c that is perceived to have a higher stability of incomes).
 In the context of consumption-data, we thus fix a certain ontological sense
 of status as the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk or 
\shape italic

\shape default
probability associated with the transition to the highest band of net-worth
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A better model for status would depend on a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 around the individual â€“ since status is inferred from the local context
 of the consumer.
 Our attempt to use the risk in net-worth is by definition to standardise
 the status perceptions at a larger scale (higher level).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A high-status individual is thus someone who has either or both of high
 income and a high (inter-generational) 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability to move towards the high income group (stability).
 In the same ontological sense, a low-status individual is someone who has
 either or both of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 As indicated before, the empirical studies in health and sociological sciences
 often track status in terms of income, education, occupation (see Michelson
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

\end_inset

) - which too easily fits in with our ontological sense of status since
 skills and identity influence the probability of moving towards high-income
 while occupations and income influence the net-worth directly.

:The status-signaling through consumption can be associated with this definition
 as well - since one's consumption is driven not only by how much of a stable
 net-worth (and hence status) one has but also by how much status or future
 expectations of status one may perceive to have.
 The disproportionate expenditure on visible goods - as evidenced by much
 of the literature on conspicuous consumption - can be explained with a
 high 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability of status promotion in our model for status.
 It can be argued that any society where a social order exists would have
 barriers to status associated with income, social identity and the combinations
 thereforth.
 Further, with economic upheavals (e.g.
 the evolution of markets, industrialisation) the poorer social identities
 may try to cross previously imposed barriers through consumption (bandwagon
 effect) while those with richer social identities would attempt to guard
 their status through consumption (snob effect).
 Separating oneself from others through consumption (when all else fails)
 minimises one's own perceived risk (if not the actual risk) of moving away
 from the high-income group.
 Thus, status consumption is likely to exist in any economy where social
 stratification exists.

:Higher status individuals - who are more likely to own long-term durable
 goods (LTDG) and have a 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of staying close to the high-income group - are more likely
 to spend on the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC) as well.
 On the other hand, those with the lower status can indicate net-worth or
 participate in social-ranking only with ENDC.
 The sure way of achieving higher status (in its ontological sense) is to
 increase the chances of staying in the high income group but beliefs in
 the power of social ranking through consumption can transform the subjective
 probability of promotion and hence the ENDC that arises out of it.
 This is because a consumer who believes that she is going to get richer
 would attach less downside risk to the possibility of growth of income
 and of LTDG.
 While we make no explicit attempts to parametrise the role of markets in
 the discussion yet, it hardly needs convincing that the advertising campaigns
 are well aware of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour for lower payoffs
 relative to higher payoffs (and risk-aversion for higher payoffs compared
 to lower) and that the campaigns must play a role in transforming the consumer'
s perceived probability of promotion of her status/net-worth through consumption.
 So even though the LTDG may be surer way to achieve status (simply on grounds
 of higher costs) they require more will-power and patience to accumulate
 whereas ENDC is more affordable and made more accessible through markets.
 By means of an example, a low-income individual may be less likely to buy
 a luxury car in the developed market but may still be willing to compromise
 on other needs if a rental luxury car is made available and advertised
 aggressively through markets.
 There is indeed a plenty of empirical evidence that points to the perceived
 reward for being in the same league as those above in the social order.

:How the

 to be answered - but before we address the issue, it is worth emphasising
 just how often the distinction between the

\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probabilities of social mobility is omitted in the popular discourse on
 normative economics.
 The idea that the differences in purchasing power between the sections

 economic progress could be achieved by letting an exchange between the
 rich and poor thrive

 The stable net-worth model for status where individuals optimise expenditure
 based on future income expectations - may look promising in the sub-Saharan
 African economies too - if one considers that in the post-feudal societies
 all over the world, a promise for social mobility has been of some importance.
 In nearly all the developing countries, we see a new working class having
 replaced the feudal or colonial systems of the century before - developments
 that make one compare the status competitions in the post-war Africa and
 Asia with the rise of middle class in post-medieval Europe (see Frank

: The similarities in contexts seem to offer a convincing evidence that
 believing and acting in hopes of social mobility could invariably lead
 to the development in economic institutions and a consequent rise in incomes.
 It may seem therefore that the distinction between the 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
and 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
mobilities is rather unnecessary.
 However, most studies on social-mobility do point to a relevance of social
 identities - particularly in the developing world (arguably where Adam
 Smith's principles were never permitted to thrive).
 Since the changes in political landscape of Africa and Asia have been recent,
 the effects of past political conflicts still reflect themselves into the
 differences in occupational-classes and educational levels.
 In the developing countries, thus both social mobility and consumption
 are influenced by social identities (see Khamis at al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia"

\end_inset

, Kaus
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

) - whose evolution over time is shaped by factors well outside the realms
 of consumption and income.
 That said, the segmentation of both demand and status determinants based
 on social identities and region is not the only problem one faces with
 the use of a model where consumers spend on items in the hope for social
 mobility (see Blanden-Machin

) on the measurement of social mobility based on the life-cycle transition
 in the identified income and occupation groups).
 The dynamics of status - expressed as risk-adjusted net-worth - are far
 more complex and even if we view these dynamics as stochastic transition
 of the status determinants (i.e.
 education, income and identity etc.), the evolution of status (stable net-worth)
 over time - whose expectation is gauged by the consumer's 
\shape italic

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

: For us to have a theory that makes empirical sense, the uncertainty in

Based on a political science approach to the risk, one could observe social

).
 The other factor that ought to influence both the perceived and observed
 probability is the presence of state and welfare institutions.
 The consumer's expected growth in the educational levels and other status
 determinants are likely to influence consumption - but these determinants
 are often public goods and thus the expectation for their growth depends
 on the strength of the state institutions.
 In the developed world, the state institutions often intervene when market
 forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertakings
 or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 However, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developing
 world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distribution
 of public goods.

Welfare Institutions and Political Risk as influencers of probability :
\series default
 The development of services such as health, education or even electric
 power where a consumer could spend her income is often stalled in the developme
nt countries due to lack of a predictable payment structure amongst the
 customers.
 It may seem ironical then that despite the majority of non-agrarian workforce
 being employed in the private enterprise, one cannot assume perfects markets
 in the developing countries - since the private enterprise receives very
 little governmental assistance and is unable to undertake projects that
 require a higher investment (in relative terms).
 This also confirms the conventional wisdom that without the key institutions,
 one cannot assume that more spending on a conspicuous item by the rich
 could benefit the society as a whole.
 The hope that money obtained from the rich on the item could potentially
 fund employment and other opportunities rests upon the institutions being
 strong enough to ensure that the anticipated trickle down effect works.

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Welfare Institutions and Political Risk as influencers of probability :

 When the distribution of assets such as education are assisted by the state,
 the expected risk in levels in education themselves is clearly lowered.
 Thus, how much education eventually matters towards status may depend on
 how consumers set themselves apart in the social order based on other determina
nts of status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't provided by
 the state (as is the case in the developing world), a consumer would associate
 higher risk with the expected growth in education.
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions determines the expectation of accumulation
 of public goods (such as family education level).
 How much education may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect
 of the strength of institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets
 that may provide the expanded consumption choices to the consumer.
 Here too, when can set the risk associated with education - a priori -
 based on the metrics for strength of state and welfare institutions.

 So far, we have argued

 While there is no doubt that a consumer has reasons to signal status through
 consumption, this would be motivated by the 
\shape italic

\shape default
probabilities (which influence social mobility).
 Perceived probabilities - which influence consumption - don't change the
 observed probabilities except through socio-political changes.
 While consumption indicates this belief in mobility (perceived probabilities),
 in long-term view, what matters is how much mobility is observed.
 We differentiate the two in data by observing items that are passed on
 to the next generation and those that aren't.
 With a dismal view that is characteristic of our discipline, we can be
 sure that in the long-run there is little more than the net asset worth
 of the individual and a probability determined by factors more tangible
 than perception (factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.)
 that are passed over as inheritance and contribute to 
\shape italic

social mobility.
 Therefore, over generations (i.e.
 in the sufficiently long-term), how individuals perceive themselves matters
 towards status only as long as believing so leads to an

 As Thaler et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 had argued in their influential paper on a behavioural life-cycle hypothesis,
 there should be no overeating and overspending if the consumers were rational.

 assumption of conspicuous consumption being essentially futile - as was
 argued by Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), then there is no way for the rational consumer to derive any utility
 from status-related consumption.
 However, the mere existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there
 is some utility to be derived by spending on status.
 A relevant model which has influenced much of the empirical literature
 using cross-sectional data on conspicuous consumption was proposed by Ireland
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

.
 The model uses a visibility factor to argue that the perception of one's
 income by others derives an additional utility (see Heffetz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

 for this substantiation and an empirical approach towards the Ireland model).
 As long as conspicuous consumption exists - one can argue that the visibility
 factor in the Ireland model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 ought to be non-zero and the consumers would 
\shape italic
infer
\shape default
 visible utility by observing consumption.
 The visibility factor based approach allows consumers to spend on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 products.
 While this approach has its merits, we find the assumption of status being
 derived from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

futile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items too strong for empirical purposes in a more general study of inequalities
 and quality in the developed and the developing economies (see Ustuner
 et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 for difficulties in extending the literature on conspicuous consumption
 in the developed countries on to the developing world).
 The futility assumption makes less sense in the developing world 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 where there are far fewer exclusive conspicuous items and the expenditure
 on conspicuous items is limited to a much smaller portion of the population.
 More importantly, since an item provides advantages both through visibility
 and quality, the visibility-based empirical classification of status-items
 in the developed world itself is fraught with problems (escaped only through
 a consumer survey of one's own).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of deciding on a crisp boundary between visible and non-visible
 utilities, we focus on the quality defined as expensive non-durable consumption
 (ENDC - which prices status or visible benefits and signals elitism) and
 ownership of long-term durable goods (LTDG - which signal that it'll take
 longer for others to acquire a particular costly item).
 Visibility is relevant to both ENDC and LTDG.
 Our focus on quality criteria rather than visibility thus is not intended
 to diminish the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption but only to include the latter in a wider model for status
 and income.
 Visibility does contribute to status and therefore utility to the consumer
 - but one also needs to relate visible consumption with the underlying
 economic variables that may drive status (or utility) in the long-run.
 By means of an analogy, let's consider the market for cars where status
 is signalled through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption might tell us that the consumers
 pay more attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would like to see primarily - i) the constraints on
 occupation and income that exist in the respective areas and ii) the price
 differences in the cars being sold in the market.
 In our original problem of status consumption, while it is true that individual
s spend more on their outward appearances (despite controlling for everything
 else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not all what status
 consumption may comprise of (see the Figure

: As we detail in the later sections, visibility can be viewed in relation
 to the consumer's preference order of commodity groups for quality.
 In the different separable commodity groups we identify for consumption,
 we assume that the consumer adjusts quality based on a preference order
 over the commodity groups - e.g.
 a consumer may consider quality for transport more important than quality
 in food (or vice versa).
 When prices change, the consumers are assumed to maintain a pecking order
 of quality which they compromise on or overspend on.
 Note however that such an order matters for any two selected items only
 if they are in different commodity groups.
 For the items within the commodity group, a preference based on visibility
 doesn't exist in the model.
 For example, in the Tanzanian LSMS data where we identify five categories
 - Food, Energy, Transport, Household and Social Functions, visibility may
 not have much of a role to play within each of the commodity groups even
 though the consumers may consider the quality in one group more important
 than in the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the current model for long-term and short-term needs does not
 view status consumption as futile but relates it with an expectation of
 social mobility - which is influenced more with long-term possessions than
 non-durable consumption.
 In terms of the model, an identity (religious, racial etc.) may carry status
 only through a history of past LTDG ownership, incomes/occupations (a criterion
 that may allow us to quantify the role of identity in status).
 The model doesn't attempt to track evolution of status - but is only interested
 in how consumption can change under different strata of status - by focusing
 only on long-term utility through accumulation of durable goods and the
 short-term utility of quality of quality in non-durable consumption apart
 from the fulfillment of general needs.

\begin_layout Standard
If we consider an environment of stable prices i.e.
 if we ignore the effect of price changes for a moment, then the distribution
 of ENDC weights may change when the individuals acquire long-term durable
 goods and spend on their upkeep and maintenance costs or as they give up
 on hopes of acquiring costlier LTDG (possibly due to other needs).
 It is assumed that a consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality
 (there is little evidence of that in the data) - therefore when prices
 are stable, a rise in expensive nondurable consumption must come either
 from an increase in income or from depletion of savings (sale of long-term
 durable goods).
 Likewise, a drop in ENDC must be due to purchase of LTDG, addressing of
 more urgent needs or a drop in income (when price are stable).
 We assume that the rational consumers in our model hope to increase either
 LTDG ownership or ENDC at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the environment of stable prices, the consumption is influenced by long-term
 expectations - which is measured in the model as a vector of occupation,
 education, region (locality, neighborhood) and LTDG.
 Since income, occupation and education are fixed in the short-run, what
 changes most often is the acquisition of LTDG that are available in the
 market if the needs of the consumer haven't changed.
 Whenever long-term durable goods are purchased, the consumer must undergo
 a change in the weight of the quality in the consumption categories if
 i) her needs (including status needs) haven't changed (status can only
 be indicated through LTDG ownership or ENDC) ii) if she is not saving for
 another asset (the consumer is more likely to spend on quality if she doesn't
 have more long-term durable goods planned to purchase in the future) .
 We assume that except for the change brought about by LTDG or needs, a
 consumer does not change her taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we now turn to the effect of price changes, then we must consider the
 price of quality in the various groups and that the quality in one category
 may be substituted with quality in another.
 Such a substitution may not be perfect (as is required in a simple-repackaging
 approach) but a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport
 to food or vice versa - driven by change in prices, LTDG ownership or needs.
 To illustrate this substitution with an example, consider a middle-income
 family that cuts down on expenses (due to loss of income) by moving to
 a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants are
 fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place - so the consumption would either
 shift to saving for a better car (LTDG) or improve quality in some other
 category (better jewelry, better schooling for kids etc.) - assuming the
 needs of the family except indicated by the number of family members haven't
 changed (including what one may call the status needs of the consumer).
 In the case of the switch in the commodity group where a higher quality
 was preferred, the price of high quality (fine-dining) seemed too high
 for the food category.
 This example of the switch also illustrates that the difference between
 needs and status-needs is not a concern for our model - as the model only
 observes the differences between high-price and low-price consumption in
 the same group - assuming that the essential needs are independent of the
 wealth of the consumer
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The difference between needs and non-needs may seem critical to some for
 any study on status-related consumption.
 However, the issue is only a semantical one since our view of needs is
 only that of basis needs.
 Any non-essential needs are interpreted in terms of quality (ENDC) and
 assets (LTDG).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the example, therefore, one could proxy the needs of the family with
 simply the number of family members and their age.
 In terms of the model, notice that the difference between the status of
 a rich and a poor family is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general status-need
 for the family to maintain quality across all categories - a task that
 is better afforded with higher income.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by expensive
 non-durable consumption and possession of LTDG in all commodity groups
 - driven by wealth and income of the consumer (rather than high-class or
 low-class needs of the consumer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While expensive nondurable consumption (ENDC) weights do not contribute
 to status over a long-period of time - the long-term utility is influenced
 only by inheritable LTDG purchases and the occupation-education-region
 vector.
 We maintain the view that status - in its ontological sense - is not changed
 in deterministic way with short-run purchases - even though the planning
 for high-status over life-time and the attempts to get into a rich-club
 can be indicated by a disproportionately high expenditure on high quality
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This view also supports the idea that faced with a choice of fulfillment
 of essential needs and higher quality, one would reduce the quality immediately.
 Needs to meet a particular calorie-quota for energy are indeed more important
 than consuming electricity 
\shape italic
per se
\shape default
.
 However, there is both myopia and inertia in the choices - therefore a
 consumer is likely to switch to electricity or better meat when she receives
 a higher income and has propensity to stick to these choices when the prices
 increase.
 In a times-series analysis, the consumption in the next cycle would thus
 depend on the current ownership of assets and the current quality.
 In addition to the state of the consumer, such demands are shaped also
 by the introduction of LTDG and high-quality products.
 The distribution of quality across commodity groups is the subject of the
 next subsection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's illustrate this with an example : consider a two commodity-group world
 where prices are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{1}^{2},p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for group 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{1},p_{2}^{2},p_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for group 2.
 Assuming the price are in an ascending order, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{2}^{1}$
\end_inset

 are the prices of the cheapest commodity in each group and can be considered
 the base-prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively .
 Assume for a moment that the consumer's income remains constant.
 Notice also that one of the preconditions of the quality-measure we've
 adopted (i.e.
 Equation

 Now if price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$

 increases and the quantities consumed of the item with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 remain the same, then for the total expenditure in group 1 (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

) to remain the same, the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 must decline (i.e.
 less of the items with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be consumed).
 If the consumer doesn't decrease the quantities consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1},q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=p_{1}^{1}q_{1}^{1}+p_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{3}q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 would increase due to rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer must adjust 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=p_{2}^{1}q_{2}^{1}+p_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{3}q_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - since her total income remains the same.
 It is possible, therefore, that the consumer spends less on food overall
 - for example - to support her energy needs.
 The switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be the first-level of substitution while the switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 would constitute the second-level of substitution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's see how our assumption changes the problem.
 Consider the case when the group 2 is comprised only of elementary goods
 with the just one price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and a set of long-term durable goods whose price is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

>>
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 (LTDG) .
 In that case, the first-level of substitution would be applicable only
 for group 1 and the second-level of substitution would be driven only by
 the savings for the long-term durable good in the group 2 (with price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 Thus under C.1 and C.2, certain commodity groups being dominated by LTDG
 and others by ENDC associate the second-level of substitution with the
 LTDG ownership in the model.
 It's easy to see that increases in incomes i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2}$
\end_inset

 do not change the substitution much differently from how change in prices
 would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parametrisation comes through the normalisation of the consumer basket
 - while we can identify a fixed number of commodity groups in the consumption
 data in a selected country, we should recognise that the quality variation
 may not exist in the market for a certain commodity group in one country
 while it does in the other.
 For example, in Tanzania - the car rental market is small and the variation
 in the quality of cars being sold may be smaller than in a typical city
 in the developed world.
 It is clear that when quality variation is not observed in a commodity
 groups, only the relevant LTDG in the group can bring status.
 Thus, the unavailability of the quality variation in the category would
 either increase the savings for the next available LTDG in the commodity
 group or increase the quality consumption in some other commodity group
 (assuming status needs remain the same).
 These 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jumps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in quality represent the life-style differences between the developed and
 the developing countries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before formulating the specifics of our model, we explain why a model for
 quality-substitution depends on a measure for quality that is applicable
 to all commodity groups.
 We then explain the other level of substitution that associates the ownership
 of long-term durable goods (LTDG) with quality.
 Explaining why neither a two-state budgeting model nor a simple-repackaging
 model would be suitable for this substitution, we motivate a discrete model
 for utility for the substitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that only either ENDC or LTDG can dominate in a category (i.e.
 the condition C.1) risks ignoring some quality differences when LTDG too
 have quality variation.
 For example, if several types of cars exist in the transport commodity
 group as do the limousine companies for a taxi-commute, then C.1 would ignore
 the quality variation in either one of them.
 To ensure that the quality differences amongst LTDG are not ignored when
 there are quality difference in the non-durable consumption within the
 same category where C.1 is assumed, we impose another relevant condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
C.2 Acquiring long-term durable goods (LTDG) is always more expensive than
 engaging in the higher quality or expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirically, this condition is not as problematic as it may at first appear.
 For example, there are no LTDG in the food category (or energy) that could
 matter for the long-term utility for the consumer while the quality consumption
 in housing is made irrelevant by the high (relative) price of housing.
 Even in the taxi vs cars example above, we can ignore the quality variation
 in limousine-companies as long as C.2 is satisfied.
 This is not to say that a model with quality variation amongst LTDG is
 not possible (a consumer can choose between types of housing for example)
 - only that for us to consider the quality differences in a commodity group
 (e.g.
 housing), we would need to relieve the assumption that only one of LTDG
 or ENDC can matter in commodity group (unless one views housing too as
 non-durable consumption).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model most appropriate for our study is a discrete model for utility.
 The quality measures for food, energy may be combined relatively easily
 but for us to compare the jumps (changes) in quality for a household with
 the probabilities of ownership of LTDG, we need to view the stochastic
 model for utility that was first used by McFadden et al

\begin_layout Standard
We now comment on the form of the utility function for the consumer.
 As we have mentioned before, the individuals net-asset worth which tracks
 status is proxied by income, education, occupations, regional/social identity
 and the long-term possessions.
 Believing that there is a probability of promotion of self-evaluation by
 an expensive non-durable expenditure (denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

) is modeled with a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 which controls the ENDC.
 Hence the consumer optimises the utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\kappa,A,\eta)$
\end_inset

 in the short-term where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 denotes the long-term possession, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the quantity consumed driven by needs of the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 denotes the quality of consumption associated with the stochastic function
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of this probabilistic model, those investing in higher-education
 for their children, for example, would accumulate possessions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to increase the likelihood of higher status for their children and have
 a different value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 from those who don't.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we are concerned primarily with a cross-sectional study in the current
 chapter, we postpone the details of the probabilistic model until a later
 chapter when a time-series formulation is developed.
 In the current chapter, we focus viewing how ENDC varies across different
 strata of LTDG and income.
 Based on the model for long-term utility, there are two supply-side factors
 that should be observed for such a comparison

 In a more traditional model, one would discount the projections of savings
 and non-durable consumption subject to a wealth constraint - and associate
 a stochastic component to the consumers decisions.
 The model we use is based on McFadden's approach where utility is decomposed
 into a systematic component and a random component i.e.
 a decision maker chooses and option

 and

 the random utility.

\begin_layout Standard
McFadden's is essentially a technique to model the discrete choice of a
 consumer.
 In our case, whether the consumer saves for purchasing an asset or not
 is the discrete choice - particularly so because the savings rate of the
 consumer is an unobserved variable.
 In a time-series formulation we may use a general stochastic form of this
 process and associate it with the probability of acquiring assets

In the general approach for evolution of the savings rate, the consumer
 would have a certain expected savings process - whose expectation (or discounti

 itself would determine We assume that the utility of the consumer evolves
 with a general stochastic process the

 to purchase and asset or not.
 The asset states that the consumer enters in are - the low band, the medium-low
 band, the medium-high band and the high band - these constitute the asset
 order we have talked about in the previous sections.

Let the utility of the consumer be

 A key argument here is that the tendency to expand one's needs also adds
 to the felicity (utility) of the consumer.
 That the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 and quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 should be parameters with respect to which the

 is non-decreasing, needs little explanation but the argument that utility
 also increases with respect to needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 relies on the life-cycle hypothesis - which considers how an individual
 obtains a stable income before expanding her family and sheds off assets
 acquired over the active years - enabling the further generations to replicate
 that same behaviour.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$

 as non-stochastic components and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$

 as the stochastic components imply a model where consumer makes the discrete
 choice of purchasing an asset while getting a non-stochastic utility from
 quality of consumption.
 An individual who considers two choices 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{1},\kappa_{1},\eta_{1})$

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that our notion of quality is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality of life
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in general - but simply the quality of non-durable consumption.
 The differences in quality of assets can also exist for the consumer but
 we recognise that owned assets are of less importance within certain commodity
 groups (see condition C1).
 To quantify some of these notions of life-style choices through quality
 and assets, we now outline a model for intertemporal choice that would
 be developed further in later sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a long-term direct utility that the consumer optimises such
 that it is a function of the needs, the assets she possesses and the quality
 of her non-durable consumption.
 Considering two consumers in the urban and rural areas with the assets,
 quality and needs being 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{u},\rho_{u},\eta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{r},\eta)$
\end_inset

 respectively (for simplicity, we have set 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{u}=\eta_{r}=\eta$
\end_inset

), a non-decreasing utility would mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}\Rightarrow u(A_{u},\rho_{u})>u(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

.
 It is also possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

 are not defined since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u},\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

 may not be available to the rural consumer.
 Notice that we don't consider income as an input to the long-term utility.
 This is because we assume that the utility of income is realised with the
 purchases of assets and quality.
 For the urban and the rural consumer, as an example, having a refrigerator
 or a car would be more noticeable than the income itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A non-decreasing utility also implies that for a rural consumer who does
 not possess a refrigerator to have the same utility as her urban counterpart,
 she would have to purchase a higher quality i.e.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{u},)=u(A_{r},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}>\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

.
 While a particular form of this social function 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 may help us understand how a consumer compensates for not having an asset,
 it is the relevance of such choices to the observed consumption data that
 concerns us more in an empirical analysis.
 A utility function that we desire should help us quantitatively explain
 for example - how much more furniture for a rural consumer would make her
 indifferent to owning electrical assets (and less furniture) in an urban
 area.
 It should also explain whether higher priced assets always provide a higher
 long-term utility to a consumer etc..
 With vast differences in income and wealth that exist in many of the developing
 countries, we believe such questions ought to be considered in any discussion
 on consumption of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To model the sharp (discrete) differences in life-style choices and the
 unobservable factors that create them, we introduce an uncertainty in the
 long-term utility - so that our representative consumer who has a higher
 value of owned assets has only a probabilistic higher long-term utility.
 The long-term utility in the model is incremented in a deterministic fashion
 only with the assets that can be transferred over generations (including
 education, language spoken and occupational ranks) while the immediate
 enhancements to felicity, improvement in self-image - all contribute as
 less deterministic factors to the long-term utility.
 Thus our representative consumer may not gain any long-term benefits from
 an immediate felicity and the stochastic factors other than a better self-image
 and social environment which would in turn help her in acquiring assets
 in the longer run.
 We claim that as long as an empirical distinction between quality, needs
 and assets can be made, the consumption of quality would reflect the self-image
 of the consumer - i.e.
 her expectations of a future improvement of the long-term standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an important advantage in the empirical work with the differentiation
 of assets from quality in the above fashion - particularly so if one were
 to extend the notion of long-term utility to status-related consumption.
 While the literature on conspicuous consumption often relies on Veblen's
 futility assumption for conspicuous items - treating status goods as those
 that offer no true utility - our approach may allow all items to contribute
 to status by letting every purchase of any kind improve one's relative
 position in the society.
 A good would contribute to utility by offering i) an immediate benefit
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(\eta)$
\end_inset

 ii) an expectation of self-improvement 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho)$
\end_inset

 and iii) a definite long-term improvement in wealth or security 
\begin_inset Formula $(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The researcher can associate certain items to the respective groups for
 each of these functions (
\begin_inset Formula $A,\eta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) while the model's representative consumers ought to either attain higher
 wealth (income) through long-term assets or increase the felicity and the
 expectation of stable high-income through higher non-durable consumption.
 In an equilibrium, the consumers would stay at a quality consumption level
 just equivalent to the perceived probability of promotion - as the deterministi
c part of their long-term utility is provided by owned transferable assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model above is indeed a simplistic one since it treats a population
 with more focus on quality as the one participating in more conspicuous
 consumption.
 However, we must emphasise that the above approach relies on the notions
 of quality, need and assets - ideas that vary across geographies and require
 some subjective judgment.
 It would be hardly appropriate - for example - to consider sundry electrical
 items as assets in a developed economy.
 The ability of a market to differentiate items within a commodity also
 influences a particular view of model's long-term utility (more quality
 is on offer in some markets than others).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a model for a risky long-term utility, we can now return to comparing
 the rural and the urban consumers.
 It is possible that the rural consumer not having the refrigerator believes
 that she isn't far away from having one by enhancing her social network
 and obtaining higher ranking within her own locality.
 Urban life does not need to imply a necessarily better life-style but it
 does provide an increased possibility of access to industrial goods - such
 as electrical items.
 Further, if the consumer is amongst the poor in a rural area (lower ranking
 due to assets) and consumes less quality, then she may have little to lose
 by moving to the urban area - where the assets may be lower, but the perceived
 probabilities of transition are higher due to higher population and increased
 qualities (availability of new assets).
 There is an upfront cost to pay - possibly with a loss of assets or quality
 in other areas - but it isn't reflected in the differences in cost of assets
 alone.
 Instead, an increased perceived probability (quality) also has a role to
 play in the long-term utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, if it is possible to model the acquisition of assets over
 time, an intertemporal setting could further enhance our understanding
 of how quality of expenditure changes over time - allowing us to provide
 more robust insights on how long-term utility inclusive of status is indicated
 through consumption - which we view as a combination of quality in commodities
 and acquisition of long-term assets.
 To motivate a discrete model for consumer choice, we now provide a multinomial
 logit analysis of quality against assets owned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
==
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of our analysis is to see how long-term status needs of the consumers
 - fulfilled with purchase of assets (which translates into an upward movement
 in status in the model) - relate with the short-term needs that are fulfilled
 with expensive non-durable consumption.
 Much the way we were wary of claiming that consumption on items indicates
 perception of status hierarchies, we don't claim that the observed social
 mobility - recorded in this way - serves as a measure of how status is
 perceived in society.
 The variation in the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC) across occupation
 ranks, education, social identities and the assets owned across the economy
 tell us to what extent the consumers may overweigh on quality instead of
 owning long-term durable goods (LTDG).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dependent variable in the regression indicates the band of assets in
 the cost order that consumer belongs to be (based on assets owned) - i.e.
 a discrete variable indicating whether the person owns a low, medium-low,
 medium-high or high-value asset.
 These 4 values are referred to as the variable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

band_general

 in the results.
 The non-stochastic control variables comprise of the observed quality differenc
es 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{energy},q_{protein}.q_{starch},q_{fat},q_{beverages},q_{fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{household}),log(x_{transport})$
\end_inset

 (the logarithm of total expenditure in the category) and the variables
 for household characteristics: occupation, region, language(s) spoken,
 household-size, highest education level of the household head as well as
 the age of the household head.
 An explanation for all the control variables is provided in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example of the measurement of the quality-related control variables,
 note that the quality of starch is a price-ratio weighted average of the
 quantities of starch - i.e.
 mass consumed of the following items - rice_husked, rice_paddy, maize_green,
 maize_grain, maize_flour, millet_grain, millet_flour, wheat, bread, bunscakes,
 pasta, othercereal, cassava_fresh, cassava_flour, sweet_potato, yam and
 potatoes.
 The price-ratio (or the relative price structure) is calculated simply
 by dividing the price (per kg) of each commodity in the group with the
 cheapest starch (based on price per kg) in the market.
 For example, if the price of rice_husked and wheat were 5Â£/kg and 7Â£/kg
 respectively, then for a household that consumes 1 kg of rice_husked and
 2 kg of wheat, the quality metric would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1\times7/5+2\times1}{1+2}=1.13$
\end_inset

 (assuming risk_husked is the cheapest starch).
 The quality metrics are calculated similarly for protein, beverages etc..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have ordered a few control variables to assist conclusions from the regressio
n.
 While the LSMS survey records numerous occupations and education levels,
 we have both ordered and narrowed them into variables that are of a coarser

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable listed in the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 ranges from 0 to 3 where 0 denotes poor, 1 denotes low, 2 denotes middle
 3 needs high - income occupations.
 Similarly, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

education_rank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable ranges from 1 to 4 indicating the order of education level obtained
 by the head of the household (4 is highly educated, 1 is less educated).
 The dependent variable in the regression is denoted as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

band_general
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - which ranges from 1 to 4.
 The high value of the band_general indicates an owner of expensive assets
 while low value of the variable indicates and owner of the cheaper assets.
 More particularly, 4 denotes high-asset ownership, 3-mediumhigh, 2-mediumlow
 and 1-low (base case).
 The dy/dx values (see the Appendix for the STATA commands used) indicate
 the discrete changes from the base case (low asset ownership) - i.e.
 transition from the base of low-asset ownership group (band_general=1)
 to the respective group (band_general=2,3 or 4).
 The margins are showed in the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The results in Table

LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:probit"

\end_inset

 and Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:margins_probit"

\end_inset

 show that medium-high assets seem limited to the cities.
 But the overall effect of having these assets seems to depend more on other
 factors.
 So while households in the rural areas do miss out on ownership of the
 medium-assets available in the cities - being in urban areas doesn't change
 the ownership of assets significantly.
 To infer the relative effect of control variables, we rely on the margins
 analysis results from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:margins_probit"

\end_inset

.
 The consumption on quality on starch and fruits-vegetables is particularly
 interesting.
 It seems that the high-asset owners spend on quality in starch but not
 as much in the fruits and vegetables.
 This could simply be because the varieties in starch - which can be stored
 for longer than fruits-vegetables in the processed form - are consumed
 at a higher price (processed) by the asset-rich in the urban areas.
 The same is not seen for fruits and vegetables.
 The protein, fat and beverage quality does not seem to vary significantly
 across the asset ownership bands (implying that all asset owner categories
 seem to consume meat and expensive protein varieties).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of education seems to matter for being in the high-asset owner
 group (i.e.
 either education is more accessible to the asset-rich or that it is a surer
 way to become asset-rich - a distinction that cannot be made without the
 panel-data analysis).
 Although age is statistically significant for band 3 and 4, it has a rather
 weak economic effect.
 The significance of household size seems to indicate that the needs do
 reflect themselves in asset ownership - since larger families seem to own
 more assets.
 However, this effect too is rather weak.
 The litlang variable (the language spoken) does not seem statistically
 significant - implying that the asset ownership is not particularly segmented
 amidst the natively-educated (Kiswahili) and the English-educated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most unsurprising finding is probably that electricity (or quality in
 energy) is consumed almost exclusively by the asset rich (band_general=4).
 This is simply because electricity is needed only by those who have already
 purchased electric/electronic assets (which form the bulk of medium and
 high assets).
 We also observe that while occupation-rank seems to transition the consumer
 from low-asset ownership to medium-asset ownership, it doesn't seem to
 be associated with high-asset ownership as much.

The results are summarised in the plot of the margins probabilities shown

 The reported count 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 in the regression is .49 (see the fitstat output in the Appendix for other
 results on the statistical fit).
 Even though we cannot comment on the price-elasticities in a cross-sectional
 analysis, the results indicate a marked change on ENDC across commodity
 groups in the different groups of asset owners.
 A further regression performed across multiple quantiles could provide
 further insights into how the purchase of assets changes in different quantiles
 of the society.
