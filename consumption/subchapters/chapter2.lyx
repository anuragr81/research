\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is derived based on the framework for intertempor
al consumption choice.
 Status is endogenised as states of financial stability and included as
 part of the consumer's utility in a model where the consumer balances her
 needs for quality in the present with the potential of higher status (state)
 through savings for assets in the future.
 Theoretical and numerical solutions are discussed before estimation of
 the model from the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata (years 2010, 2012
 and 2014).
 Possible refinements of the model for decision under uncertainty are discussed.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a conventional analysis of demand, one uses the prices and quantities
 observed of item to understand the relative importance of commodities with
 respect to each other.
 The demand for individual goods is often aggregated into that of commodities
 for it to be compared it with its past values or with the respective values
 in a different population.
 While the literature on quality has considered market characteristic and
 shadow prices - the literature on conspicuous consumption has explored
 visible consumption more often.
 Less attention has been paid to ideas conceived by Duesenberry.
 The literature on demand for quality - the lack of market prices in consumption
 microdata.
 We enhance this with a model for quality and incentive compared with acquiring
 more assets in the near-term.
 We attempt to do this using consumption under risk - which has had a long
 tradition as the intertemporal substitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an attempt to refine permanent income approach, we view conscpicuous
 consumption as a general preference for quality which is sensitive to perceptio
n of how (subjectively) probable a future state of economic security is
 perceived.
 We use the assets (durable items) owned as an indicator of income (particularly
, when the data available on income is poor in the informal economies).
 The empirical methods we seek employ the substitution between saving for
 assets and consumption of quality in a life-cycle model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main argument of the model is that a consumer seeks to optimise the
 utility obtained by her needs, owned assets (including skills and characteristi
cs that are acquired over multiple generations) and the quality.
 All non-durable consumption is to viewed as a combination of needs and
 quality - both of which the utility is a non-decreasing function of.
 Further, the status that a consumer derives from consumption - in any sense
 - must come out of either elite non-durable consumption or high-priced
 durable consumption.
 Using a model for intertemporal choice of quality and assets under uncertainty
 over time, we then explain status consumption by tracking the consumption
 of quality and owned assets over time.
 The two exogenous variables in the model are therefore i) the extent to
 which the consumers maintain their long-term habits of purchasing quality
 (by purchasing more quality or making some discrete choices) and ii) the
 extent to which they choose to save for future stocks rather than to overspend
 on higher quality in the current time period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we can view status as long-term utility, then the effect of the needs
 of the consumer and the structure of market prices for assets and quality
 can be incorporated into the utility model.
 For example, we know that costs of the owned assets (long-term durable
 goods - abbreviated as LTDG from here on) are much higher compared to the
 quality consumption and would have a more definite impact on the consumer's
 long-term utility as they are a more certain indicator of the stability
 of her income.
 To standardise the LTDG options available to the consumer, we may order
 the LTDG in the respective markets based on their costs of acquisition.
 Using a discrete model of utility, the differences in the costs of two
 successive LTDG in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cost-order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for LTDG would affect the substitutability between acquisition of durable
 goods and quality consumption to the consumer as the consumer may give
 up hopes of acquiring assets if her income is expected to follow a trajectory
 of a low income group.
 Thus, if a consumer wishes to improve long-term utility of status, a higher
 difference between two successive LTDG costs is likely to make the consumption
 of quality more feasible to the consumer- whereas low differences would
 make the acquisition of LTDG easier.
 In this case, as in other, both the relative income of the consumer and
 the prices of items to be consumed in the local market have an effect on
 the consumer's demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we do rely on many of the insights from behavioural economics, we
 note that decision making under risk is far easier when probabilities are
 known.
 Given a list of known probabilities, one can consider how the consumer
 behaves.
 But the issue with uncertainty is that there the probability of change
 in political - are all fundamentally guesses.
 We therefore rely on the framework provided by the subjective probability
 approaches.
 We put forward the claim the probability of promition is indicated through
 consumption of quality derive the measures for tendency to save.
 In the current chapter, we provide a non-stochastic model and define the
 parameters in the Euler Equation for asset growth that are controlled by
 the consumer while associating observed probabilities of status growth
 with consumption of quality.
 In this simple model, the exogenous process for income is also viewed as
 non- stochastic\SpecialChar endofsentence
 We therefore assume that a consumer knows her expected
 income path given her education, skills and social background (by the time
 she is of working age).
 The model we develop is then matched with the assets acquired, the quality
 (interpreted in terms of total per need unit).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, we attempt to view status-related consumption could be viewed
 in a conventional model for consumer demand.
 An interpretation of status consumption is possible, if we base ourselves
 on the assertion that for status-related consumption to exist, status must
 appear in the long-term utility for the rational consumer in a model.
 For a rational consumer to spend on status consumption, she must see some
 status utility from consumption in the long-term or the short-term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We don't attempt to explain to what extent is status a long-term concern
 vs a short-term concern for the consumer.
 Nor do we intend to take an ideological stance on whether status consumption
 is wasteful or a consequence of a belief in social mobility.
 The purpose of using utility model is to endogenise the role that social
 identities may play in an economy.
 The recent literature suggests in societies undergoing economic upheavals
 (e.g.
 introduction to global markets, industrialisation), the poorer social identitie
s may try to cross previously imposed barriers through consumption (bandwagon
 effect) while those with richer social identities would attempt to guard
 their status through consumption (snob effect).
 Separating oneself from others through consumption (when all else fails)
 minimises one's own perceived risk (if not the actual risk) of moving away
 from the high-income group.
 Status consumption - in this sense - is likely to exist in any economy
 where social stratification exists.
 Instead of explicitly stating which items are considered a status item
 or not, we only view the items ordered by a quality within commodities
 whose demand can be considered separable.
 Interpret the quality as the distance of expensive nondurable consumption
 (ENDC) from the minimum cost of needs, we argue that status in the short-run
 can only be achieved through quality of consumption.
 We then test whether the preference for quality increases with changes
 towards industrialisation or if it is more likely that quality is used
 to compensate for not having as much status and durable goods (LTDG) as
 others.
 Comparinig quality metrics from across different economic strata (classified
 in terms of occupation-rank or education levels) of a cross-section, this
 also implies testing just how much is a higher preference for quality associate
d with measures of social mobility in the economy (i.e.
 purchase of assets or an upward movement in education and occupation for
 a member of the household).

Reference points connect the disparate literature threads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ever since elasticities were first used in demand analysis, the change in
 needs for commodity groups over time has been of interest to econometricians
 and policy makers.
 Here, both the behavioural and classical approaches seem to find some evidence
 for habit formation in the consumer panel data.
 The measurement of the effect of change in habits and quality on the consumer
 price index has had a long tradition (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment).
 Within this classical framework, Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."

\end_inset

 explains the consumer preferences with a model for myopia.
 In more recent studies where a general setting of the intertemporal substitutio
n problem in a life-cycle context has been used, a rational utility-optimising
 consumer can balance between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned and actual savings over her life-time.
 This is the setting explored by a few behavioural approaches (see Shefrin-Thale
r 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

) that have attempted to model the rules of mental accounting used by consumers
 - in order to better understand the conditions that lead to development
 of habits.
 Modeling the consumers' inertia of choices, such approaches allow the represent
ative consumer to be influenced by behavioural factors such as willpower
 rather than letting them become subservient to an optimised plan for life-time
 savings and consumption.
 In what may appear to be a more accurate representation of real-life consumer
 behaviour, the representative consumer in such models is subject to accumulatin
g items that she doesn't need and acquiring habits of consumption she could
 barely afford in the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thread of literature observes how social identities play a role
 in status-signalling and the way assets are accumulated over generations
 and passed on as endowments.
 Empirical studies in both the developed world and the developing countries
 have found social group identities relevant to consumption (see Chao et
 al.

).
 We note that a behavioural model could incorporate such behaviour with
 the use of reference points (see Markowitz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) - whose applicability clearly isn't limited to the controlled settings
 of a behavioural experiment alone.
 Robert Frank

 the lower economic strata when they are huddled in the overpopulated suburban
 areas of big cities in the US.
 Similarly, Chai et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that the conspicuous consumption in S Africa is relative to local
 income-groups.
 A general approach to social order is proposed by Corneo et al

 and Coleman

 who motivate the case for a ranking order of status while attempting to
 measure the tendency of the consumer to move herself up in the ranking
 order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Driven by local relative-wealth differences, the status competitions are
 also relevant in the developing countries - particularly where rapid industrial
isation has created vast differences in the urban and rural life-styles.
 Even though a detailed time-series of consumption microdata matching in
 granularity with that from the developed world is hardly available in the
 developing countries, a framework for risk preferences can still be used
 to understand consumer demand in the developing countries.
 One such model for urban and rural interactions is the Lewis model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GollinLRF"

\end_inset

 - which views urban migration as a necessary phase of development - leading
 to a competition between industrial and agricultural sectors for labour
 and food (it predicts the prices of food to rise as labour moves from agricultu
re to industry).
 Here, the worker/farmer is meant to maximise her income and reduce the
 risk associated with it as she is faced with the choice of migration to
 the urban areas.
 One can enhance the model with refinement of migration incentives.
 An interaction between introduction of industrial goods and status needs
 of the consumers has been a subject of many sociological studies that have
 in turn inspired the empirical analyses associating the urban developments
 with the finer trends in consumption.
 A flight to urban areas after all is not merely an escape from despondent
 circumstances but also an access to expanded consumption basket and a (perceive
d) promise of social mobility.

 Some approaches - e.g.
 that of Sen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sen2005Calories"

\end_inset

 - attributes this squeeze to the rise in the poverty-level for consumption
 of non-food items.
 From a behavioural economics perspective, such a change amounts to a change
 in the reference point for non-food consumption.
 But since reference points for the consumption microdata may be more vague
 than those in a controlled lab experiment, such models are always subjected
 to measurement errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If however, the reference points can be justified in such a study, one can
 rely on a crisp boundary that separates a bare necessity from a luxury
 (i.e.
 a reference point for subsistence).
 Studying

\end_inset

 consumption in the regions of erstwhile East and West Germany, for example,
 Friehe et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrieheGermany"

\end_inset

 attempt to answer whether prolonged measures of income equality can influence
 conspicuous consumption asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes.
 If the macroeconomic factors and issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) can be controlled for
 in the data, then a general model for long-term (or more stable) needs
 against short-term (or more uncertain) needs could explain the demand pressures
 induced by the income differences in both the developed and developing
 economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more general definition of what constitutes status-related consumption
 is however somewhat evasive.
 The studies make varied assumptions about what to include as part of conspicuou
s consumption and what not to.
 Some studies for example - include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in the status-related items while others don't.
 In some instances, a consumer basket identified from a different economy
 is used for another economy which is being studied.
 Except when a survey is used to identify 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption, the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption in the question
 often simply comprises of items that are known by common knowledge to have
 some signaling value (jewelry etc.
 that were identified by Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"

\end_inset

).
 As studies on conscpicuous consumption set themselves to explore the demand
 for conscpicus items, they tend to favour the Ireland model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

 - which separates visible consumption from the non-visible consumption
 - assuming that conscpicous consumption brings no utlity in the regular
 sense of utlity (henceforth referred to as the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items as one good.
 Despite the appeal for tractability of the Ireland model, we favour the
 approach adopted by Corneo et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 (for reasons which we later explain) - who view snob and bandwagon items
 as the fundamental mechanism for status consumption.
 Linking the competing behaviours of snob and bandwagon items (through pecuniary
 emulation and inviduious comparison - which was what Veblen had intende)
 with consumer decision under risk, we seek items as a consequence of belief
 in mobility rather than visibility of items.
 We argue that status - in an ontological sense - encompasses the consumer's
 preference to long-term protection and hence the risk associated with the
 promotion to a state of higher income and assets (consumer behaviour being
 influenced by any characteristic that is perceived to have a higher stability
 of incomes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical studies in health and sociological sciences often track status
 in terms of income, education, occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

\end_inset

) - which easily fits in with our ontological sense of status since skills
 and identity influence the probability of moving towards high-income while
 occupations and income influence the net-worth directly.
 In the context of consumption-data, the ontological sense of status is
 simply the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk or

probability associated with the transition to the highest band of net-worth

A better model for status would depend on a certain

 around the individual – since status is inferred from the local context
 of the consumer.
 Our attempt to use the risk in net-worth is by definition to standardise
 the status perceptions at a larger scale (higher level).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A high-status individual is thus someone who has either or both of high
 income and a high (inter-generational)

probability to move towards the high income group (stability).
 In the same ontological sense, a low-status individual is someone who has

probability of transition to high net worth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Observed and perceived Probabilities as the basis for status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since one's consumption is driven not only by how much of a stable net-worth
 (and hence status) one has but also by how much status or future expectations
 of status one may perceive to have, the status-signaling through consumption
 is influenced also by the consumer's perception of risk.
 A disproportionate expenditure on visible goods - as is evidenced by much
 of the literature on conspicuous consumption - could thus be seen as a
 high 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability of status promotion in this model for status.
 Barriers to status associated with income, social identity and the combinations
 thereforth - are what constitute a social hierarchy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The perceptions being subjected to factors other than observed past mobilities
 with respect to household characteristics is the reason why we distinguish
 the 
\shape italic
perceived
\shape default
 probability from the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of social mobility in the model.
 The idea that the differences in purchasing power between the sections
 of a society and the desire for mobility amongst them can drive consumption
 and economy dates back at least as far as Adam Smith who had proposed that
 economic progress could be achieved by letting an exchange between the
 rich and poor thrive
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmithMoralSentiments"

\end_inset

.
 If we do not draw a distinction between the perceived and observed probabilitie
s of social mobility, we could assume the households optimise expenditure
 based on future income expectations which they develop based on the observation
s of past mobility.
 Under such a model, a lower status score e.g.
 lower asset possession or lower education would make the consumer less
 interested in saving for high-cost assets and less interested in indicating
 status through high quality in certain categories (e.g.
 luxury items) that are meant to accompany high-status.
 Instead, the consumer would focus on saving for assets and invest in characteri
stics associated with higher income (this is the promise of mobility that
 has been argued from Adam Smith to Friedman).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature on coscipicuous consumption, on the other hand, are not in
 union over the effect of income (see Khamis at al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia"

\end_inset

, Kaus
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KausSA"

\end_inset

).
 We intend to explain this clustering with an expectation of the growth
 of household characteristics.
 One way to resolve whether the consumer should spend more on conscpicuous
 consumption or not with a given social identity is by what utility they
 may get from the consumption.
 If hopes of (or through other segregation) .
 Bandwagon Consumption may make sense only when there is a common market
 - unleashing which is what East-West Germany, Kaus and Veblen might have
 noted .However, the consumer may also choose - as an instance the pecuniary
 emulation - to improve quality for a commodity that is achievable within
 her means.
 Such an improvement would mean forgoing the future asset growth for quality
 needs in the present.
  but it is possible that those low-income groups or social segregated would
 (hence the).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, the expected evolution of household income over time is shaped
 by factors well outside the realms of consumption and past income.
 This is why we're particularly aware of political factors while extending
 the expectation of income model into the developing countries.
 The competitions amongst the nascent industrial classes for status has
 been a subject of many sociological studies in the late 20th century.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 noted Veblen's pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

 in the Indian context (referred to as 
\shape italic
Sanskritization
\shape default
) as the erstwhile lower classes emulated the habits of higher social classes
 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, the habits of the upper economic classes were similarly
 observed to have expanded to the middle and lower classes in the decades
 after the second world war (see Appendix for a survey of the economic history
 of a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa).
 In all post-feudal societies all over the world, where markets have devleoped,

 the century before in the countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adam Smith's assertion that the belief in social mobility drives the development
 of economic institutions (and a consequent rise in incomes) cannot be interpret
ed as the equivalence of perceived and observed mobilities – simply because
 empirically social-mobility is always sensitive to the social identities,
 parental education or income levels in both the developing world and the
 developed world (see for example, Blanden-Machin
\shape italic

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) on the measurement of social mobility based on the life-cycle transition
 in the identified income and occupation groups).
 The framework of expected utility should allow that matched perceived probabili
ty with consumption and observed rates of mobility as assets growth is generic
 enough to quantify conscpicuous consumption across the develpoed and developing
 countries - despite how disparate the items can be within them and despite
 how different their cultural contexts may be.
 how persisting levels of inequality and differential access to industrial
 goods could shape demand in the short-run would help us understand the
 demand pressures in the developing countries better - before it can be
 compared with late 19th century America.
 the claims of developments in the post-war Africa and Asia being equivalent
 to the rise of middle class in post-medieval Europe could thus be verified
 based on the criteria.

Life-cycle hypothesis 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The earliest econometric attempt to explore the role of status in consumption
 that we know of is due to James Duesensberry 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Duesenberry1949"

\end_inset

 who had explained the role of savings rates and security on consumption.
 Similar problems were addressed by the permanent income hypothesis proposed
 by Milton Friedman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"

\end_inset

 - who modeled the consumers' smoothening of income over the expected future
 time periods.
 While challenges were posed to both the relative income and permanent income
 hypotheses, they have provided empirical answers to some important questions
 related to the role of income and class on consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The permanent income has provided a smoothening of income approach.
 Here, the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with her
 income - requiring her to maintain buffer stock for her needs in a way.
 This model works does not factor the affect of relative income and largely
 ignores the belief or movement between the status 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Friedman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"

\end_inset

 has very clearly stated that his intention to focus only on non-human wealth
 in the uncertainty after acknowledging that many types of wealth exist
 on which the degree of uncertainty may vary.
 Friedman is also clear about the equivalence of the believed uncertainty
 and the mean observed levels.
 Friedman also relies on transitory component being counter-balanced by
 permanent component - the permanent income theory is based independence
 (zero-correlation) or transitory component with the permanent component
 - a much stronger component than what we may require.
 Friedman too considers inheritance as an increase in the permanent income
 - which we explcitly model as assets.
 Friedman views observed income as the sum of transitory and permanent income
 components - assuming that permanent (long-term ) consumption is a fixed
 proportion of the permanent income.
 Friedman's empirical analysis observes the dispersion if income amongst
 social classes - (gauged with a simple variance in past income).
 That one should observe the dispersion in quality as well motivates much
 of our study.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As such permanent income, does not explain the conscpicuous consumption
 because the low-income does would always encourage high saving in the model

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In discounting the role that

 wealth i.e.
 a higher status would play in an economy, Friedman in fact goes to the
 lengths of viewing a society where human wealth matters as a slave society.
 As the modern society is a non-slave society, a focus on non-human wealth
 may be adequate - the argument goes.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In fact a rational consumer predicting future incomes based on the past
 incomes, has no reason to engage in any status related consumption (neither
 in short-term nor in long-term) as she knows all about her future plans.

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways in which we modify this approach - first, we attach a
 long-term utility with status consumption -for if there is indeed nothing
 to be gained by status-related consumption (the assumption of conspicuous
 consumption being essentially futile - as was argued by Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), then there is no way for the rational consumer to derive any utility
 from status-related consumption.
 Second, we limit the consumer to either saving for LTDG or spending on
 some level of quality (ENDC) based on her perception of the value she attaches
 to conscpicuous consumption.
 This makes sense if we intend to model the uncertainty associated with
 growth in income, needs and assets.
 When the materialisation of a consumer's future plans is probablistic,
 the known probabilities would allow the consumer to spend the amount correspond
ing to her belief in conspicuous consumption.
 Indeed, the probabilty of change is not known before hand - and a cosnumer
 only has beliefs about the future state of parameters.
 For example, a consumer may be more confident about her income than of
 the improvement of healthcare in the economy and so on.
 We therefore let a prior decide how certain the consumer may be for different
 parameters in the model.

 a behavioural life-cycle hypothesis.
 Regardless of how one models the deviation from the optimal plan, the mere
 existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there is some utility
 to be derived by spending what is not rationally advantageous to the consumer.

Our focus on quality criteria rather than visibility therefore does not
 diminish the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption - only aspires to include the latter in a wider concern for
 status and income.
 Visibility therefore does contribute to status and therefore the utility
 to the consumer - but it's latter's suitability to the intertemporal problesm
 that allows to relate it with the underlying economic variables.
 By means of an analogy, let's consider the market for cars where status
 is signalled through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption might tell us that the consumers
 pay more attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would also want to see i) the constraints on occupation
 and income that exist in the respective areas and ii) the price differences
 in the cars being sold in the market.
 In our original problem of status consumption, while it is true that individual
s spend more on their outward appearances (despite controlling for everything
 else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not all what status
 consumption may comprise of (see the Figure

 for the terminology around status consumption).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since visible consumption can be of long-term significance or of short-term
 significance, we view visibility as relevant to either ENDC or LTDG.
 A visible item is effectively a high-quality item in our framework and
 a visible long-term asset (which is passed down from generations) would
 qualify as a high-quality asset as long as it is priced in the market.
 For our model, however, it being a long-term asset matters more.
 It being visible and thus being of higher quality compared to the non-visible
 assets (and in thus being higher-priced) allows us to view such an asset
 as simply a higher cost asset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We often find that that higher durable accompany may accompany higher quality
 consumption - this is both a feature of demand (someone struggling with
 buying a house might not go on a shopping spree for luxury watches less
 oten) and supply (better housing might mean higher expenditure on schooling
 and dining etc.).
 In other words, there are clusters of higher-.
 We intend to model that by letting quality be attached with.
 With low-assets one does not necessarily have high-quality consumption
 but with high-quality assets one can both afford to and is pressured on
 having high-quality consumption.
 This is explored later in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"

\end_inset

 - but for now let's just say that visible consumption - in the sense of
 status benefit we have described - encompasses both high-quality assets
 and high-quality non-durable consumption.
 When higher-quality consumption it is seen as to what extent is detached
 from what is imposed from supply (you're compelled to buy good coffee if
 you spend on an expensive coffee machine etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
The way understand this detachment - is the extent to which long-term quality
 habits are acquired.
 Visibility can be considered as this order.
 Within non-durable consumption (where visible consumption is often recorded
 in the literature), one can view visibility as consumer's preference of
 quality from amongst the commodity groups.
 In the different separable commodity groups for consumption, the consumer
 may adjusts quality based on a preference order over the commodity groups
 - e.g.
 a consumer may consider quality for transport more important than quality
 in food (or vice versa).
 When prices change, the consumers can be assumed to maintain a pecking
 order of quality which they compromise on or overspend on.
 Commodities where visible consumption dominates, should be preferred for
 quality than where they don't exist.
 This also implies that a preference based on visibility doesn't exist in
 the model for items within a commodity group.
 As an example, in the Tanzanian LSMS data where we identify the commodity
 groups - food, energy, transport and household, visibility may not have
 much of a role to play within each of the commodity groups even though
 the consumers may consider the quality in one group (e.g.
 transport) more important than in the other (energy).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term needs does
 not view status consumption as futile but relates it with an expectation
 of social mobility - which is influenced both with long-term possessions
 and non-durable consumption.
 The relevance of a social-identity to status is modeled through an expectation
 of high status through a history of past LTDG ownership, incomes/occupations
 (a criterion that makes the consumer raise her expectations through association
 with the identity).
 The model doesn't attempt to track evolution of status - but is only interested
 in how consumption can change under different strata of status - by focusing
 only on long-term utility through accumulation of durable goods and the
 short-term utility of quality of quality in non-durable consumption apart
 from the fulfillment of general needs.

Ontological Status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model solves the optimisation of additive utility over a life-time to
 arrive an optimal long-term quality level.
 Every consumer spends based on her knowledge of the past and her expectations
 of the future states - assigning some probability to an improved state
 of herself.
 The model allows the consumer to assign a higher probability to landing
 in a state of higher status than what is known through more deterministic
 trends of income (or risk).
 Consumption of quality therefore serves two purposes - it improves felicity
 in the present but also increases the likelihood of improved social networks
 in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the behavioural approach to status interpreted as the risk-adjusted
 net-asset worth that we have motivated, the 
\shape italic

\shape default
probabilities are related to 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probabilities through the life-cycle model.
 This is done by setting up priors for expectations of parameters with varying
 degrees of uncertainty.
 So far, we have defined 
\shape italic
observed

mobility as a certain degree of social mobility where status is defined
 as a measure of stable high income i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
likelihood of landing up in a higher income group (through social interactions
 which the consumers spending more on higher quality and long-term durable
 goods/characteristics are more likely to achieve).
 The 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability - on the other hand - is what motivates the consumption performed
 in the hope for social mobility.
 It is the observed probabilities that are shaped through socio-political
 changes - whereas the perceived probabilities influence the consumption
 idiosyncratically.
 Short-term consumption - shaped by the perceieved probaiblity of rise in
 income - is not entirely independent of the long-term growth.
 We consider the a different probability only to allow the consumer in the
 model to deviate from long-term expectations - which are themselves assumed
 to exogenous in the model and whose structure is known a priori to the
 modeler.
 This rather Keynesian view of probability of growth lets high-quality consumpti
on track the belief in mobility.
 The long-term probability of mobility is observed through more rational
 means.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distinction between short-term and long-term consumption is not as difficult
 once we start to consider the life-cycle approach to the problem.
 By long-term assets we mean the items that are passed on to the next generation
 - while those that aren't passed are considered short-term.
 Observed probability is everything that can be transferred between generations.
 In the long-run there is little more than the net asset worth of the individual
 a probability determined by factors more tangible than perception (factors
 such as skills, education, class, identity etc.) that are passed over as
 inheritance.
 This is the

social mobility.
 From the consumer's perspective, observed and perceived probabilities are
 tracked through how far the consumer's money would take her in the normal
 sense.
 The former provides the rational growth and the latter provides the organic
 growth.
 How individuals perceive themselves matters towards our ontological sense
 status (stability of high income) only as long as believing so leads to
 an 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
growth through net asset worth or the 
\shape italic
observed

probability associated with the status determinants (e.g.
 skills, education, social identity etc.).
 These are not equivalent in the model and the consumer only particiate
 in high quality consumption based on the belief in the latter.
 Alternatively, their participation in the qulaity consumption is how we
 view their subjective probability of observed mobility.
 The ontological sense of Status - defined in the long term as the propensity
 towards net asset worth - would completely ignore the habits towards the
 non-durable consumption of the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth revisiting how visible (conspicuous) consumption fits in with
 this approach.
 The vast literature on visible consumption points out that a visible item
 is used both to distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour
 of those above oneself.
 Visible consumption is assumed to be futile in a sense and it's benefit
 is purely for a public image (it has no value in a private view).
 However, our view is that if investing in visible items actually leads
 to improve one's social network and improves one's stable income, then
 the items are not neither futile nor strictly public (In other words, a
 public image can have private utility).
 A luxury watch or a golf club may be futile for private use as is, but
 if an aspiring businessman uses his knowledge of luxury watches or golf
 to find new clients for her business, then the consumption is not futile
 in every sense except for the degree to which the rich of the society concentra
te around luxury watches and golf.
 Therefore, if the rich (clients of our model businessman) move away from
 luxury watches and golf, there is no utility from the luxury watches.
 This is the sense in which visible consumption is futile.
 Its utility - however - a means of connecting the rich with the not-so
 rich - it has no value except for such a connection.
 This is the link we dwell upon for our conspicuous consumption.
 The visible items are not futile in the literal sense, only that they only
 offer a probabilistic advantage to the representative consumer in terms
 of a real probability.
 The probability is important - but it may be overestimated by the consumer.
 In the example of luxury wathces, only a few of the purchasers of luxury
 watches would improve their self-image and participate in enhancement of
 social networks - many others would remain just purchasers.
 The advantage offered to the rich by luxury watches - i.e.
 that of distancing oneself from others (invidious comparison) - is rather
 immaterial from a modeling perspective - since the rich consumer already
 has enough to distance herself from others.
 The marginal utility that visible consumption offers is in little.
 Watches matter only in markets where there is little else that can indicate
 wealth - basically they matter only to indicate a club membership - when
 no other means exist.
 For the consumer's long term expectations of growth and day-to-day consumer
 behaviour, they don't have much value (this is the sense in which they
 are futile).
 They have only far less certain contribution to the observed social mobility
 than means such as education, skills, social identity or long-term assets.
 How many of our businessman actually believe is rather immaterial because
 - how many of those buying luxury watches actually achieve success is what
 matters for the model - becoming a parameter that is exogenous to the model
 - therefore, we know a priori what proportion of businessmen would succeed
 (luck - which we model - through the uncertainty in the income process
 - may favour someone else with or without the watch other than what is
 determined through more rational means).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model doesn't disallow conscpicuous consumption for a low-income houseld.
 While it true that poorest section do not benefit from leaving anyone else
 behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave anyone behind), the
 poorest may want to indicate that they are not the poorest (much the way
 richest may want it to be known to the others that they are indeed the
 richest)

 Made ubiquitous through markets and awareness of items, visible or conscpicuous
 consumption is therefore needed for everybody - as everyone in the middle
 must both try to avoid getting poorer and try to become the richest.
 That visible consumption being of different value to the wealthier household
 than that to a poorer household can be viewed in our model as different
 roles that long-term assets would play to long-term utility.
 Those that are not rich would rely more on the probabilistic benefit from
 status goods - rather than the definite benefit that long-term assets can
 bring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Probability for growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some ways, our view of conscpiuous consumption is that of non-necessary
 consumption - and we understand the basic necessity.
 This is where the model is inspired from Thaler's behavourist approach
 - conscpicuous consumption represents the ground reality of the perceptions
 of getting ahead - an increase in quality that doesn't translate into any
 long-term benefits for oneself or the household\SpecialChar endofsentence
 To put another way, all
 status signaling except what comes from observed status determinants must
 come from the short-term non-durable (non-transferrable) consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument for quality requires a special attention.
 Needs effectively provide a reference point for consumption and it is difficult
 have a universal justification for them.
 When considering food quality, we could take the cheapest protein (or starch,
 carbohydrates etc.) as the minium subsistence level - but in other contexts,
 the basic needs would require a subjective judgment.
 In the household furniture commodity, it is less certain what a basic need
 is - and if the preference a certain through material, size etc.
 qualifies as improvement in quality.
 If a refernce point is established, quality - as in a hedonic model - is
 simply as how far in price one goes away the subsistence level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this way, we can state every consumer would want the best of everything.
 There is less compensation and more overall quality that the consumer might
 want to maintain.
 In other words, it's not that the consumers want to buy a better bed -
 even though they can't afford a house.
 They in fact want the best bed now - rather than a house in the future.
 The model should allow the consumer to improve quality now rather than
 save for future.
 Improvement of quality is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more consumption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the usual sense (if we were to observe just the cost - then increase
 in quality would be a part of increased consumption).
 When going into finer details, the consumer may prefer one commodity group
 for signaling than another - but in general there has to be an overall
 improvement in quality for it to be useful in status-signalling (that's
 the only way it can indicate status over a long-time).
 We model this with the influence of assets on consumption on quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirically, we rely on the separation of the long-term (more stable) needs
 of the consumer from her short-term (more volatile) needs.
 The longer-term assets are what would cause the stability of income while
 non-durable consumption or assets that are not to improve observed probability
 in any possible are classified as the short-term needs.
 An item-by-item analysis of the life-expectancy of all owned items is possible.
 The average life-time of a product being consumed is a more objective measure
 than its status-carrying potential (which one would record in a survey).
 Whatever can't be passed on isn't long-term and would not cause any observable
 change in mobility.
 We have not assumed that the probability follows a certain process - we
 only assume that the consumer acts according to her belief about long-term
 growth.
 That is the only parameter that matters.
 We model that the rich's expectation of the future income (known only on
 the basis of their consumption of quality) is more aligned with the observed
 change.
 The rich are more likely to stay rich than the poor are to become rich
 - otherwise there would be no stratification in the society.
 This is however, exogenous to the model.
 We would expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu}{A}$
\end_inset

 to be lower for the rich than it is for the poor - whose expectation for
 the long-term growth is lower but they are more likely to overweigh on
 the probabilistic growth through 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One issue - that we have briefly touched upon is that the equivalence between
 quality in non-durable consumption and the short-term needs is that long-term
 assets also have quality differences.
 particularly because markets evolve to make high-cost assets accessible
 to the non-richest consumers.
 We view a high-quality asset as merely a more expensive asset.
 Quality differences in assets complicate things - A consumer might want
 to have a high quality consumption now rather than a low quality asset
 later.
 but a more serious issue arises due to cluster of attachment of quality
 choices with quality of assets.
 The substitution therefore is not as simple as it would be - if the a high-qual
ity asset is a more costly assets.
 It may be that the high-quality consumption is not available until a high-quali
ty asset is purchased or high-quality asset may not be available at all
 because of a long-term characteristic (segregation, trade barriers etc.).
 the choices for long-term assets may decide the fate for the rest of the
 consumption (particularly with education or housing) or a consumption can
 only be limited - therefore limiting the substitution between asset sand
 consumption.
 Long-term choices are therefore not substituted with any short-term choices,
 additivity is not a great concern for the utility.
 buying a cheaper house and a cheaper car would clearly suppress the pressures
 over non-durable consumption as well - so the consumer may focus on quality
 in some other areas.
 the quality observed in all areas therefore takes care of the missing substitut
ion.
 since we assume that high-quality non-durable consumption moves together
 with high-quality asset purchases, the substitution between assets in long-term
 and quality in short-term is still possible.

\begin_layout Subsection
Modeling non-income variables

\begin_layout Standard
We view that dynamics of status - expressed as risk-adjusted net-worth -
 as stochastic transition of the status determinants (i.e.
 education, income and identity etc.).
 Taking a Bayesian perspective, we can model some risks (e.g.
 political or macroeconomic ) that influence the uncertainty in income growth
 and are known assumed 
\shape italic

\shape default
.
 We only focus on a minimal set of parameters that would allows us to compare
 status-related consumption across a developed and a developing economy.
 Of particular interest is the parametrisation of the strength of state
 and welfare institutions - which has a definite influence on what may be
 considered of importance for (probabilistic) status
\begin_inset Foot

.
 The consumer's expected growth in the educational levels and other status
 determinants are likely to influence her expenditure.
 Therefore, when these determinants are public goods, the expectation for
 their growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public
 good.
 In the developed world, the state institutions often intervene when market
 forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertakings
 or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distributio
n of public goods.
 It is possible to parametrise such differences in the expectation of income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate why such a prior may be necessary, consider the choice of
 education whose quality may be vary in the market.
 As a consequence of the difference in expectation of growth, education
 may carry more status-value in the developing world than it would in the
 developed world - simply because the distribution education (and other
 assets that are public goods) are assisted by the state in a developed
 country and the expected risk in levels of education is lowered as a result.
 Therefore, how much education eventually matters towards status may depend
 on how consumers set themselves apart in the social order based on other
 determinants of status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't provided by
 the state (as is the case in the developing world), a consumer would associate
 higher risk with the expected growth in education.
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support in a developing country.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions would thus determine the expectation of accumulati
on of public goods (such as family education level) as how much education
 may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect of the strength of
 institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets that may provide
 the expanded consumption choices to the consumer
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It may be possible to ignore the modeling of a parameter for strength of
 welfare institutions altogether, if one very strongly believes that the
 demand for conspicuous consumption eventually benefits the society as a
 whole as the money is reinvested for the benefit of the poor in exchange
 for their services.
 In our view, the hope that money obtained from the rich on the conspicuous
 items could fund employment and other opportunities rests upon the institutions
 being strong enough to ensure that the anticipated trickle down does take
 place.
 Therefore, it would make sense to parametrise such a reinvestment of funds
 from conscpicuous consumption - if not the strength of welfare institutions
 itself.

 seem to have a stronger view and argue that the differences between the

 the poor any more.
 While the level of economic inequalities have indeed narrowed since the
 18th century, it is difficult to verify such claims (i.e.
 that price of luxuries has exceeded the opportunity cost to the rest of
 the society ).
 While we attempt to model the strength of state, we avoid basing ourselves
 on such assertions- simply because of the disparate political risks, technologi

Effect of Prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we consider an environment of stable prices i.e.
 if we ignore the effect of price changes for a moment, then the distribution
 of ENDC weights may change when the individuals acquire long-term durable
 goods and spend on their upkeep and maintenance costs or as they give up
 on hopes of acquiring costlier LTDG (possibly due to other needs).
 It is assumed that a consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality
 (there is little evidence of that in the data) - therefore when prices
 are stable, a rise in expensive nondurable consumption must come either
 from an increase in income or from depletion of savings (sale of long-term
 durable goods).
 Likewise, a drop in ENDC must be due to purchase of LTDG, addressing of
 more urgent needs or a drop in income (when price are stable).
 We assume that the rational consumers in our model hope to increase either
 LTDG ownership or ENDC at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the environment of stable prices, the consumption is influenced only
 by long-term expectations of needs and income.
 Whenever long-term durable goods are purchased, the consumer must undergo
 a change in the weight of the quality in the consumption categories if
 i) her needs (including status needs) haven't changed (status can only
 be indicated through LTDG ownership or ENDC) ii) if she is not saving for
 another asset (the consumer is more likely to spend on quality if she doesn't
 have more long-term durable goods planned to purchase in the future).
 We assume that except for the change brought about by LTDG or needs, a
 consumer does not change her taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we now turn to the effect of price changes, then we must consider the
 price of quality in the various groups and that the quality in one category
 may be substituted with quality in another.
 Such a substitution may not be perfect but a consumer may switch consumption
 on quality from transport to food or vice versa - driven by change in prices,
 LTDG ownership or needs.
 To illustrate this substitution with an example, consider a middle-income
 family that cuts down on expenses (due to loss of income) by moving to
 a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants are
 fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place - so the consumption would either
 shift to saving for a better car (LTDG) or improve quality in some other
 category (better jewelry, better schooling for kids etc.) - assuming the
 needs of the family except indicated by the number of family members haven't
 changed (including what one may call the status needs of the consumer).
 In the case of the switch in the commodity group where a higher quality
 was preferred, the price of high quality (fine-dining) seemed too high
 for the food category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, while expensive nondurable consumption (ENDC) weights do not
 contribute to status over a long-period of time - the long-term utility
 is influenced only by inheritable LTDG purchases and the occupation-education-r
egion vector.
 Status - in its ontological sense - is not changed in deterministic way
 with short-run purchases - even though the planning for high-status over
 life-time and the attempts to get into a rich-club can be indicated by
 a disproportionately high expenditure on high quality consumption.
 How choice for quality changes in relation to that for needs and long-term
 assets is simplified by the condition that faced with a choice of fulfillment

 the quality immediately.
 Needs to meet a particular calorie-quota for energy are indeed more important

 A consume is allowed to be myopic in the sense that she is likely to switch
 to electricity or better meat when she receives the chance to (e.g.
 with a higher income) or to have inertia in her choice as she may have
 a propensity to stick to such choice when the prices increase.
 The consumption in the next cycle would thus depend on the current needs,
 ownership of assets as well as the current quality.
 Other parameters may be assumed to be constant - except for what a prior
 may indicate.

Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the difference between needs and status-needs is not a concern
 for our model - as the model only observes the differences between high-price
 and low-price consumption in the same group - assuming that the essential
 needs are independent of the wealth of the consumer
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The difference between needs and non-needs may seem critical to some for
 any study on status-related consumption.
 However, the issue is only a semantical one since our view of needs is
 only that of basic needs.
 Any non-essential needs are interpreted in terms of quality (ENDC) and
 assets (LTDG).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In most case, we it may be possible to proxy the needs of the family with
 the number of family members (adjusted by their age).
 The definition of needs is important - since the difference between the
 status of a rich and that of a poor family in our model is not through
 disparate educational needs of the rich and poor children but instead through
 a more general need for the family combined with a demand for quality spread
 across all commodities - a demand that is better addressed with a higher
 income.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by expensive
 non-durable consumption and possession of LTDG in all commodity groups
 - driven by wealth and income of the consumer (rather than high-class or
 low-class needs of the consumer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That there must be the idea of an absolute need is a contentious issue.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs
 can supersede her subjective interests.
 We lean towards neither take an objective view which considers autonomy
 itself a basic need without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts can be compared.
 This is the view presented by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

- who consider the basic needs in terms of health an autonomy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming the above mechanism for status-related consumption, a higher status
 individual - who is more likely to own long-term durable goods (LTDG) and
 has a 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of staying close to the high-income group - is more likely to
 spend on the expensive non-durable consumption (ENDC) as well.
 On the other hand, those with the lower status can indicate net-worth or
 participate in social-ranking only with ENDC.
 The sure way of achieving higher status (in its ontological sense) is to
 increase the chances of staying in the high income group but beliefs in
 the power of social ranking through consumption can transform the subjective
 probability of promotion and hence the ENDC that arises out of it.
 This is because a consumer who believes that she is going to get richer
 would attach less downside risk to the possibility of growth of income
 and of LTDG.
 Although we have not parametrised the role of markets in the discussion
 yet, it hardly needs convincing that the advertising campaigns are well
 aware of the consumer's risk-seeking behaviour for lower payoffs relative
 to higher payoffs (and risk-aversion for higher payoffs compared to lower)
 and that the marketing effects must play a role in transforming the consumer's
 perceived probability of promotion of her status/net-worth through consumption.
 Therefore even though the LTDG may be surer way to achieve status i.e.
 indicate wealth (simply on grounds of higher costs) and achieve security
 - they require more will-power and patience to accumulate whereas ENDC
 is more affordable and made more accessible through markets.
 By means of an example, a low-income individual may be less likely to buy
 a luxury car in the developed market but may still be willing to compromise
 on other needs if a rental luxury car is made available and advertised
 aggressively through markets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have the following features we want in a model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
A model for needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This would be the life-cycle assumption.
 The consumer knows how her needs are going to grow until the end of her
 lifetime.
 This applies even if we model household as the unit (a dynasty rather)
 consider the needs over an infinite time-horizon.
 The idea of needs is an objective one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Assets growth of assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We view asset accumulation as the increments to an asset account - whose
 value is reflected in the total cost of assets inclusive of cash assets
 that the consumer owns.
 This approach treats the accumulation of cash and purchase of assets the
 same.
 In other words, if a consumer sets her eyes on assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

 and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) from the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model also assume that at the of her lifetime, her personal wealth would
 be exactly - her savings would either be consumed or would be passed on
 to her children.
 While all individuals in the population are assumed to be the same as our
 representative consumer in terms of the preferences for needs over quality,
 they differ in the the starting amount and trends of their salaries, the
 trajectory of their needs, their long-term quality habits and the starting
 values of their asset accounts.
 Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all assets in
 the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success to preferences
 being the same for everybody) which provides furniture, housing and all
 amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every asset and service - offered as life-long subscription - is purchased
 by giving an amount to this company.
 We ignore the depreciation of assets for the moment for simplicity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Credit or borrowing in the market is also assumed to be negligible (an assumptio
n that is not so far fetched in a developing economy).
 The no-credit assumption implies that the consumer can only save to buy
 more of the only asset available in the market.
 Therefore, if the consumer's starting income is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 so that after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working her salary is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}k^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 so that the total income she has earned is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{\tau}i_{j}=\frac{i_{0}k}{k-1}(k^{\tau}-1)$
\end_inset

.
 Now at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased assets from a portion of her income and decided
 that she does not want more assets for the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, her life circumstances might have changed (she may need
 a bigger house or want a more expensive house) thus needing more assets
 urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend both on needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 and asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In a probabilistic model, we would attach a consumer probability of these
 events occurring at different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A non-stochastic model, there may not be a way to differentiate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of income being governed by social class or education from the uncertainty
 in the the income process.
 When there is no uncertainty about the income process to the consumer,
 the real income process and the consumer's action which are known by 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conscpicuous consumption is driven not by the income process itself
 but the knowledge that most individuals withing that class, educational
 level etc.
 are going to end up a certain way is what determines the consumer choice.
 An income process derived from personal characteristics - instead of a
 that may give us a more accurate function of the unobserved variables e.g.
 personality types - may be more appropriate.
 This is an aggrement with the life-cycle hypothesis (see Thaler et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

) where the representative consumer is a risk manager based on her perception
 shaped by long-term developments - rather than somebody who execute long-term
 plans based on a finite wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a simple model of income, consider that income grows at a fixed rate
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 every year.
 Thus assuming that at the start of her working age, her starting income
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

, then her salary over the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}=i_{0}k^{t}$
\end_inset

.
 If we attach no uncertainty to the growth of income, as it would be the
 case in a non-stochastic model, the growth rate would remain the same forever
 and is known by the consumer.
 In the stochastic model we would let our consumer maintain a uncertainty
 of both how her annual income unfolds in her future years and the uncertainty
 about her improving being part of a high-consumption club.
 While these uncertainties are turned off in the non-stochastic model, the
 choice of long-term quality against the choice to save for future assets
 in an environment of definite and exogenous income growth in income can
 still be delineated with the model.

\begin_layout Standard

Long-term quality in a non-stochastic setting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key feature of the model is that it deconstructs the consumed quality
 in what is imposed by the market accessible to the consumer and the long-term
 choices she has made.
 Due to the two factors, the choice of quality is constrained.
 We use a parameter only to see how much the consumer choice is affect in
 relation to the long-term choices she has made.
 We explain a model developed with the non-stochastic Euler equations which
 use the parameters we have discussed.
 The non-stochastic model - which we calibrate with the consumption microdata
 - is described with the following equations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\eta_{t+1}=\eta(t,T)\nonumber \\
A_{t+1}=A_{t}+(i_{t}-c_{t})\nonumber \\
i_{t+1}=ki_{t}\nonumber \\
c_{t}=\nu\eta_{t}p(A_{t-1},\rho)\label{eq:nonstoch}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 represent the consumer needs at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the value of asset account (comprising of cash reserved for assets as
 well as the total value of assets owned), 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are the static household characteristics (educational level, religious
 or social identity etc.), 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the income obtained in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 the consumption in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that in addition to the quality control
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 , the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 also depends on the price of quality that is imposed by the asset choices
 in the past or the household characteristics that are acquired over generations.
 The reason why we separate this cost from the consumer choice of quality
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is that i) certain quality choices are imposed by the asset one possesses
 - e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment etc.
 where avoiding the respective expenses is not an option for the consumer
 and ii) certain long-term choices or characteristics limit the choice to
 avail quality in the short-term.
 In the common usage of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

needs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one may have consider such costs as needs of the consumer, but since our
 notion of needs is based on health and autonomy of the individual, this
 is the only way the costs imposed by the assets and social identities may
 enter in the model.
 Another way to interpret the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 is viewing how a consumer matches her consumption with the assets she owns
 and the long-term characteristics she acquires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the life-time of T years, the consumer optimises the non-stochastic
 sum 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum_{i=1}^{T}\upsilon(c_{i},A_{i},\eta_{i})$
\end_inset

 .
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\ge1$
\end_inset

 to consume the quality she desires.
 The minimum cost for maintaining the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 are meant to be chosen by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=1$
\end_inset

.s Higher the value of the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, higher is the consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and lower is the future growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The control
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be seen as the long-term habit of the consumer and is the only variable
 in the model that is adjusted by the consumer.
 Other than this parameter, the consumption depends both on needs and the
 long-term choices of the consumer (which are encapsulated by the asset
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 the consumer has accumulated in the past and the the personal characteristics
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 she possesses).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see how this may work in an empirical setting, consider the commodities
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0},I_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

 with the respective prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0},p_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}<p_{1}<p_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Further, let 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 be the item with the lowest available quality (hence the minimum price
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

) and the quantity needed for minimum needs be 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 Ignoring the effect of assets accumulation and long-term choices for a
 moment, a consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{10}q_{11})$

\begin_inset Formula $(q_{20},q_{22})$

\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is quantity consumed of item 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

 by the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 - would effectively set 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\nu_{1}p_{0}=\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{1k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}\nu_{2}=\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{2k}$
\end_inset

.
 In this setting, the value of the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{i\in[1,2]}$
\end_inset

 represents merely the distance from the fulfillment of the basic needs
 i.e.
 the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}$

 The value of the control is not a quality metric that one may use in a
 demand function

 Consider a consumer facing only the prices

 The likely effect having just the quantity consumed as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{10}$
\end_inset

 would be to reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{1k}=p_{0}q_{0}$
\end_inset

 The effect of having constraints on quality due to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to addition and removal of items from the basket respectively.
 If a consumer is in a region where only some of the items of the basket
 of a more urban consumer (who has access to all items) are available to
 the consumer, the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 she chooses is equivalent to removing some items from the urban consumer's
 basket.
 Thus the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can be seen as a filter on the set of prices of a basket of all items (i.e.
 items available at a national level or at the respective top level of granulari
ty) returning the prices over which 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is chosen by the consumer.
 Similarly, when the consumer acquires assets, her basket effectively expands
 as she is forced to be away from basic needs consumption cost

 Second, the control

Another way to solve a non-stochastic intertemporal problem is by drawing
 an equivalence between total wealth with total outlay in the classical
 consumer choice problem before using similar econometric methods

Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\beta ln(x)+\gamma ln(p)+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 commonly used in estimation derived effectively from 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x\Rightarrow log(w_{i})=log(p_{i})+log(g(x,p))-log(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Here, with 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,p)$
\end_inset

 as the Marshallian demand function, using the double-logarithmic model
 (which is a mere restatement of existence of elasticities through total
 differentiation), we have 
\begin_inset Formula $log(g(x,p))=\alpha_{i}+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}log(x)+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p)}log(p)$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $log(w_{i})=\alpha_{i}+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}-1)log(x)+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{i})}+1)log(p_{i})+\sum_{j\ne i}\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{j})}log(p_{j})$
\end_inset

 The adding up restriction is more difficult to impose on this form rather
 than the slightly modified : 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{i}log(x)+\gamma_{i}log(p_{i})$

 An estimation of demand elasticities of consumption can be performed using
 parallel - arguments using the total wealth constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset

 In such a formulation, the constraint for the consumer can be stated as
 the total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\delta_{i}(A_{T}+\sum c_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 are the assets accumulated over the period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and the discount factors can be chosen as
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{i}=\frac{1}{1+i}$
\end_inset

 (this holds even if one assumes that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 is 0 at the end by the consumer spending everything as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{T}$
\end_inset

 at the end of period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 Equivalent to the case of income constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}=x$
\end_inset

 for the maximisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\textbf{q})$
\end_inset

, the wealth constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is meant to be known to the representative consumer i.e.
 the consumer chooses a plan for 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i},A_{i}$
\end_inset

 knowing what her total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and future expectations of prices are.
 The demand function would be 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=g(W,p)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the price of consumption.
 The cost of consumption is a combination of both i) the non-decreasing
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 which in turn depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and ii) and the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 which is chosen by the consumer based on the quality of consumption she
 desires.
 In this chapter, we focus on a simulation assisted approach to demonstrate
 what illustrations can be drawn from the model in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the above model notice that we observe 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $i_{t\in[1,T]}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t},c_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $T$

 as well as the overall quality i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{c_{t}}{\eta_{t}}=\nu i_{t}mA^{\alpha-1}$
\end_inset

 which we estimate using cost of a basket of basic needs (see the details
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:EmpiricalIssues"

\end_inset

).
 We estimate the exogenous income process with region, background and other
 household characteristics - so a consumer is expected to know her income
 trajectory through these parameters.
 The goal of the econometric method is to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$

\begin_inset Formula $m$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

The obvious limitation of the non-stochastic approach is the independence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 on the degree of uncertainty in the model parameters.
 Therefore, the non-stochastic model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

 disregards the beliefs in social mobility that may motivate increases risky
 behaviour to the consumer.
 As the only way for a consumer to reach a higher status in the non-stochastic
 model is through accumulation of assets i.e.
 growth in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (or change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

), she is likely to settle for low range 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,A$
\end_inset

 (and consequently have low-status) if she wants to keep 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 low and high
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The total wealth constraints ensures this when total wealth (
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 ) is low.
 Therefore by diminishing the role of social mobility, the model over-emphasizes
 the role that the starting value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 plays towards gaining status through 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Attaching some probability of social mobility through education or social
 participation - which is not modeled in the equations

- is a more likely representation of the real-world that we explore later.

Empirical measurement of quality and needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have hinted in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:nonstochproblem"

\end_inset

, our notion of quality is dependent on what we consider as needs rather
 than the characteristics of items using a hedonic approach (see Rosen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenImplicitHedonic1974"

\end_inset

 for an summary of hedonic approaches).
 We define needs as the standard requirements not meeting which would lead
 to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory argued for by Doyal
 and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"

\end_inset

).
 To the argument that a family can survive on just starch, the counter-argument
 would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the consumer incurred
 by not having protein is definite.
 As far as the model is concerned, the theory of needs is more of a normative
 than descriptive - simply because a consumer may not always want her needs.
 If she forgoes protein and compromises on her health (and probably autonomy)
 in favour of some other needs, the importance of a particular basket -
 and hence the claims based on that basket - would clearly be diminished.
 As a result, the goal of econometric methods we propose is not to argue
 that consumers act according to a certain set of needs (descriptive) but
 only to test whether they act according to a set of needs or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a standard way to view needs can be set, measure for quality as distance
 the cost of the basic needs can be obtained.
 We identify food, energy, shelter (household) and transport as the commodities
 for which needs exist in a developing economy.
 For food, the price of a standard food basket expressed in terms of protein,
 starch, fat and fruits-vegetables is used.
 For energy, a basic calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal
 and lighting is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of
 kerosene (or a cheaper alternative) when available.
 For household, the cost of the minimal house in the locality (amortised
 over the average working life) and the cost of clothing per year is used.
 We use a calorie quota for transport - which can either be provided by
 food (walking) or energy (running fuel-engines).
 The empirical measure of quality is the a measure of how much the consumers
 deviate from the local cost of the standard basket of minimum expenses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be argued that sustenance is possible in a developing economy with
 tattered clothes and intake of raw food.
 This, however, is unlikely to be a serious concern for the model.
 First, the purpose of our standard basket is much narrower in context than
 defining a poverty level - as it only sets a point of reference to see
 how the quality variants of particular commodities are spread across the
 economy.
 Second, the price filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 does take care of lifestyles that are lower than the chosen threshold.
 More particularly, the consumers who don't own assets can have a zero consumpti
on in the model if 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)=0$
\end_inset

 for low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 (or certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 In other words, since a consumer would rather eat cooked food and buy clothes
 than save for asset and eat raw food, the possibility of survival of those
 consuming below our chosen standard basket is not an issue for the model.
 Using similar arguments, we should expect very few consumers to compromise
 over basic food quality by a lot only to purchase electricity or a similar
 asset.
 Since quality often moves together in this manner, it would make sense
 limit much substitution between consumption, assets and quality across
 commodities.
 Hence we permit summation of qualities across commodities and an additive
 utility for the consumer.
 Thus, given 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 categories (e.g.
 food, energy etc.), if we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1,t}=\nu_{1}mA_{t-1}^{a}i_{t-1}\eta_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2,t}=\nu_{2}mA_{t-1}^{a}i_{t-1}\eta_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, then we can write:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
c_{t}=\sum_{k=1}^{N}c_{k,t}=(\eta_{t-1}A_{t-1}^{\alpha}m)\sum_{k=1}^{N}\nu_{k}\label{eq:quality_sum}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every household thus responds to the common needs differently by adjusting
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\nu_{k}\}$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\nu_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 While it is possible to evaluate the model in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

 for the different commodity categories (i.e.
 using 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2},\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 etc.) - but we use the combined 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\nu_{k}$
\end_inset

 to explore how overall quality may evolve in an intertemporal setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A specification function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can be accurate only if we have i) detailed price information for all items
 ii) the same level of detail across all local areas considered and iii)
 the asset ownership information for every household.
 With the detailed local structure of market prices (or the information
 about availability), we can decompose consumed quality into what is offered
 by the local characteristics and the choice of quality made by the consumer
 (with the quality control variable
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

).
 The effect of prices on the quality consumed could thus also be viewed
 as what is the change in quality that is offered in the market vs what
 the consumer chooses in the response to change in relative prices structure
 of commodity variants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have briefly discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:nonstochproblem"

\end_inset

, the price and asset level variables - even if available at the consumer
 level - are more likely to be discrete ( e.g.
 the list of assets owned or the list of goods within a commodity).
 For quality, a continuous interpretation is easy to obtain when a mix of
 goods of different qualities is purchased by the consumer.
 For example, a measure of protein quality can be obtained when every consumer
 purchases some quantities of eggs, chicken and beef.
 The discreteness and non-normality of data may become an issue when the
 prices for some goods (e.g.
 beef in the example) rise by a lot relative to the cheaper alternative
 goods or when a particular good is always in short-supply (unavailable)
 in some areas.
 In such cases, the segregation in quality is likely to create jumps in
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 that would make the continuous parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $m,a$
\end_inset

 in the Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

 somewhat of an approximation.
 Still, a low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as low quality variation relative to asset ownership
 (and high otherwise).
 With this interpretation, the model should be able to demonstrate that
 a consumer in a no-electiricity zone may not be forgoing electricity by
 choice (and therefore choosing less energy quality) - she may maintains
 a long-term habit for high quality of energy that is not expressed with
 low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 She may decide to keep electricity consumption low (through 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu)$
\end_inset

 only if her long-term choice (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) or characteristics (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) make electricity available to her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For assets, the discreteness (the list of assets owned by the consumer)
 is ignored as we use the total value of assets held by the consumer as
 part of the input to 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

.
 This allows for a comparison between quality distributions between two
 economies, where the differences in successive LTDG costs (which are an
 indication of how advanced the markets may be in an economy) would appear
 as the difference the parameters of a particular form for 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $m,a$
\end_inset

 in the Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

).
 More particularly, one would expect to see the developed markets making
 rental options available for an expensive durable good (LTDG) to the consumer,
 developing new (cheaper) substitutes to reach the consumer or extending
 credit facilities to the consumer.
 This would cause the differences between successive LTDG costs (relative
 to average income) to be lower in the developed world than in the developing
 economies where markets are less developed and seldom offer credit or rentals
 for the LTDG

A discrete model for asset ownership would be revisited in the stochastic
 approach where a consumer may obtain the next asset with a certain probability
 (see Pyatt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PyattDurable1964"

\end_inset

 for a simple discrete model for ownership of assets).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 When such a comparison can be made, an implicit assumption is that all
 products (at whatever cost) can be purchased in the developing world -
 so that the quality filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho$
\end_inset

) is the same for the consumer populations in the two economies

While one may identify a fixed number of commodity groups in the country
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

, the quality variation may not exist in the market for a certain commodity
 group in the country 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to be compared with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 In Tanzania, for example - the car rental market seems small and the variation
 in the quality of cars being sold may be smaller than in a typical city
 in the developed world.
 Both the total values of assets and the distribution of quality would thus
 influence the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 and the consumer's preference for quality.
 The life-style differences between the developed and the developing countries
 could thus be compared with an appropriate form of

 It doesn't need to grow discrete (bought or not) if we assume that there
 is an asset hierarchy for every consumer as she moves up.
 A criticism is obviously that assets cost differently in .
 We however assume that assets can be ordered in a way that a consumer knows
 the geodesic to get to the next desirable point.
 Whether actually purchases the item or not is immaterial - since
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is assumed to either gain value or translate into purchases.
 For the empirical work, we simply consider the average cost of items -
 people in the agriculture hardly would buy a luxury car - but we that is
 for the consumer to follow.
 We assume that the market reflects the value of long-term assets.

The Stochastic Utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discrete choice utility does not come into until we want to handle the
 effect of long-term choices.
 If we're willing to consider characteristics like education, region, home-owner
ship or occupation as permanent for the representative consumer, then we
 don't need the discrete choice.
 It's only when we use a dynamic model for making these choices - i.e.
 whether a consumer could move to a different locality, buy a house etc.
 is when we need to model the discrete choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that we don't need to consider discrete choice for whether the consumer
 buys and asset or not.
 Since we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 separate from 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

, the asset account tracks the assets purchased.
 We only consider the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 value of this account - i.e.
 we assume that consumer purchases an asset as soon has she has accumulated
 enough value in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 - assets grow in value at the same rate as the cash (which is not a far-fetched
 assumption given the minimal credit services in the developing economies).

The important things to remember is that individuals may not behave but
 the structures they operate within are set up based on rational constraints
 on their behaviour.
 These constraints are based on certain aspects of the group behaviour that
 are part of a rational world used by the firms and institutions.
 So there are systematic/rational aspects of the behaviour and the idiosyncratic
 parts.

 In a more traditional model, one would discount the projections of savings

 a stochastic component to the consumers decisions.

 a decision maker chooses and option

\begin_layout Standard
McFadden's is essentially a technique to model the discrete choice of a
 consumer.
 In our case, whether the consumer saves for purchasing an asset or not
 is the discrete choice - particularly so because the savings rate of the
 consumer is an unobserved variable.
 In a time-series formulation we may use a general stochastic form of this
 process and associate it with the probability of acquiring assets

 to purchase and asset or not.
 The asset states that the consumer enters in are - the low band, the medium-low

 order we have talked about in the previous sections.

Let the utility of the consumer be

 A key argument here is that the tendency to expand one's needs also adds
 to the felicity (utility) of the consumer.
 That the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 and quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$

 also increases with respect to needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 relies on the life-cycle hypothesis - which considers how an individual
 obtains a stable income before expanding her family and sheds off assets
 acquired over the active years - enabling the further generations to replicate
 that same behaviour.

 choice of purchasing an asset while getting a non-stochastic utility from
 quality of consumption.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Results from Stochastic Utility Approaches
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that our notion of quality is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality of life
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in general - but simply the quality of non-durable consumption.
 The differences in quality of assets can also exist for the consumer but
 we recognise that owned assets are of less importance within certain commodity
 groups (see condition C1).
 To quantify some of these notions of life-style choices through quality
 and assets, we now outline a model for intertemporal choice that would
 be developed further in later sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a long-term direct utility that the consumer optimises such
 that it is a function of the needs, the assets she possesses and the quality
 of her non-durable consumption.
 Considering two consumers in the urban and rural areas with the assets,
 quality and needs being 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{u},\rho_{u},\eta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{r},\eta)$
\end_inset

 respectively (for simplicity, we have set 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{u}=\eta_{r}=\eta$
\end_inset

), a non-decreasing utility would mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}\Rightarrow u(A_{u},\rho_{u})>u(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

.
 It is also possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

 are not defined since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u},\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

 may not be available to the rural consumer.
 Notice that we don't consider income as an input to the long-term utility.
 This is because we assume that the utility of income is realised with the
 purchases of assets and quality.
 For the urban and the rural consumer, as an example, having a refrigerator
 or a car would be more noticeable than the income itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A non-decreasing utility also implies that for a rural consumer who does
 not possess a refrigerator to have the same utility as her urban counterpart,
 she would have to purchase a higher quality i.e.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{u},)=u(A_{r},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}>\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

.
 While a particular form of this social function 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 may help us understand how a consumer compensates for not having an asset,
 it is the relevance of such choices to the observed consumption data that
 concerns us more in an empirical analysis.
 A utility function that we desire should help us quantitatively explain
 for example - how much more furniture for a rural consumer would make her
 indifferent to owning electrical assets (and less furniture) in an urban
 area.
 It should also explain whether higher priced assets always provide a higher
 long-term utility to a consumer etc..
 With vast differences in income and wealth that exist in many of the developing
 countries, we believe such questions ought to be considered in any discussion
 on consumption of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To model the sharp (discrete) differences in life-style choices and the
 unobservable factors that create them, we introduce an uncertainty in the
 long-term utility - so that our representative consumer who has a higher
 value of owned assets has only a probabilistic higher long-term utility.
 The long-term utility in the model is incremented in a deterministic fashion
 only with the assets that can be transferred over generations (including
 education, language spoken and occupational ranks) while the immediate
 enhancements to felicity, improvement in self-image - all contribute as
 less deterministic factors to the long-term utility.
 Thus our representative consumer may not gain any long-term benefits from
 an immediate felicity and the stochastic factors other than a better self-image
 and social environment which would in turn help her in acquiring assets
 in the longer run.
 We claim that as long as an empirical distinction between quality, needs
 and assets can be made, the consumption of quality would reflect the self-image
 of the consumer - i.e.
 her expectations of a future improvement of the long-term standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an important advantage in the empirical work with the differentiation
 of assets from quality in the above fashion - particularly so if one were
 to extend the notion of long-term utility to status-related consumption.
 While the literature on conspicuous consumption often relies on Veblen's
 futility assumption for conspicuous items - treating status goods as those
 that offer no true utility - our approach may allow all items to contribute
 to status by letting every purchase of any kind improve one's relative
 position in the society.
 A good would contribute to utility by offering i) an immediate benefit
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(\eta)$
\end_inset

 ii) an expectation of self-improvement 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho)$
\end_inset

 and iii) a definite long-term improvement in wealth or security 
\begin_inset Formula $(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The researcher can associate certain items to the respective groups for
 each of these functions (
\begin_inset Formula $A,\eta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) while the model's representative consumers ought to either attain higher
 wealth (income) through long-term assets or increase the felicity and the
 expectation of stable high-income through higher non-durable consumption.
 In an equilibrium, the consumers would stay at a quality consumption level
 just equivalent to the perceived probability of promotion - as the deterministi
c part of their long-term utility is provided by owned transferable assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model above is indeed a simplistic one since it treats a population
 with more focus on quality as the one participating in more conspicuous
 consumption.
 However, we must emphasise that the above approach relies on the notions
 of quality, need and assets - ideas that vary across geographies and require
 some subjective judgment.
 It would be hardly appropriate - for example - to consider sundry electrical
 items as assets in a developed economy.
 The ability of a market to differentiate items within a commodity also
 influences a particular view of model's long-term utility (more quality
 is on offer in some markets than others).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a model for a risky long-term utility, we can now return to comparing
 the rural and the urban consumers.
 It is possible that the rural consumer not having the refrigerator believes
 that she isn't far away from having one by enhancing her social network
 and obtaining higher ranking within her own locality.
 Urban life does not need to imply a necessarily better life-style but it
 does provide an increased possibility of access to industrial goods - such
 as electrical items.
 Further, if the consumer is amongst the poor in a rural area (lower ranking
 due to assets) and consumes less quality, then she may have little to lose
 by moving to the urban area - where the assets may be lower, but the perceived
 probabilities of transition are higher due to higher population and increased
 qualities (availability of new assets).
 There is an upfront cost to pay - possibly with a loss of assets or quality
 in other areas - but it isn't reflected in the differences in cost of assets
 alone.
 Instead, an increased perceived probability (quality) also has a role to
 play in the long-term utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, if it is possible to model the acquisition of assets over
 time, an intertemporal setting could further enhance our understanding
 of how quality of expenditure changes over time - allowing us to provide
 more robust insights on how long-term utility inclusive of status is indicated
 through consumption - which we view as a combination of quality in commodities
 and acquisition of long-term assets.
 To motivate a discrete model for consumer choice, we now provide a multinomial
 logit analysis of quality against assets owned.

\begin_layout Section
APPENDIX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In absence of the additivity assumption, a two-way substitution is implied
 - first, across commodities and second, across qualities variants within
 a commodity.
 Consider a two commodity-group world where prices are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{1}^{2},p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for commodity group 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{1},p_{2}^{2},p_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 for commodity group 2.
 Assuming the price are in an ascending order, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1},p_{2}^{1}$
\end_inset

 are the prices of the cheapest commodity in each group.
 Assume for a moment that the consumer's income remains constant.
 Now if price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 increases and the quantities consumed of the item with price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 remain the same, then for the total expenditure in group 1 (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

) to remain the same, the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 must decline (i.e.
 less of the items with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be consumed).
 If the consumer doesn't decrease the quantities consumed 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1},q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=p_{1}^{1}q_{1}^{1}+p_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{3}q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 would increase due to rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer must adjust 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=p_{2}^{1}q_{2}^{1}+p_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{3}q_{2}^{3}$
\end_inset

 - since her total outlay remains the same.
 It would be possible, therefore, that the consumer spends less on food
 overall - for example - to support her energy needs.
 The switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 would be the 
\series bold
first-level 
\series default
of substitution and the switch from 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{3}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 would constitute the 
\series bold
second-level 
\series default
of substitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When additivity assumption cannot be used, two assumptions can simply the
 model - first that every commodity group is either i) one where LTDG dominate
 and quality variation does not exist or ii) LTDG don't exist and quality
 variation exists.
 With that assumption, consider that the commodity group 2 is comprised
 only of elementary goods with just one price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and a set of long-term durable goods whose price is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

>>
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 (LTDG) .
 In that case, the second-level of substitution would be applicable only
 for group 1 and the second-level of substitution would be driven only by
 the savings for the long-term durable good in the group 2 (with price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 Thus, certain commodity groups being dominated by LTDG and others by ENDC
 associate the first-level of substitution with the LTDG ownership in the
 model.
 An implicit assumption here is also that acquiring LTDG is always more
 expensive than engaging in ENDC - the quality differences within ENDC always
 matter more in short-term than the quality variation within LTDG.
 For example, if several types of cars exist in the transport commodity
 group as do the limousine companies for a taxi-commute, then without the
 implicit assumption one risks ignoring the quality variation in types of
 cars.
