Status consumption and intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is derived based on the framework for intertempor
al consumption choice.
 Status is endogenised as states of financial stability and included as
 part of the consumer's utility in a model where the consumer balances her
 needs for quality in the present with the potential of higher status (state)
 through savings for assets in the future.
 Theoretical and numerical solutions are discussed before estimation of
 the model from the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata (years 2010, 2012
 and 2014).
 Possible refinements of the model for decision under uncertainty are discussed.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HOW IS THIS ABOUT STATUS CONSUMPTION?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a conventional analysis of demand, one uses the prices and quantities
 observed of item to understand the relative importance of commodities with
 respect to each other.
 The demand for individual goods is often aggregated into that of commodities
 for it to be compared it with its past values or with the respective values
 in a different population.
 While the literature on quality has considered market characteristic and
 shadow prices - the literature on conspicuous consumption has explored
 visible consumption more often.
 Less attention has been paid to ideas conceived by Duesenberry.
 The literature on demand for quality - the lack of market prices in consumption
 microdata.
 We enhance this with a model for quality and incentive compared with acquiring
 more assets in the near-term.
 We attempt to do this using consumption under risk - which has had a long
 tradition as the intertemporal substitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an attempt to refine permanent income approach, we view conspicuous consumpti
on as a general preference for quality which is sensitive to perception
 of how (subjectively) probable a future state of economic security is perceived.
 We use the assets (durable items) owned as an indicator of income (particularly
, when the data available on income is poor in the informal economies).
 The empirical methods we seek employ the substitution between saving for
 assets and consumption of quality in a life-cycle model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main argument of the model is that a consumer seeks to optimise the
 utility obtained by her needs, owned assets (including skills and characteristi
cs that are acquired over multiple generations) and the quality.
 All non-durable consumption is to viewed as a combination of needs and
 quality - both of which the utility is a non-decreasing function of.
 Further, the status that a consumer derives from consumption - in any sense
 - must come out of either elite non-durable consumption or high-priced
 durable consumption.
 Using a model for intertemporal choice of quality and assets under uncertainty
 over time, we then explain status consumption by tracking the consumption
 of quality and owned assets over time.
 The two exogenous variables in the model are therefore i) the extent to
 which the consumers maintain their long-term habits of purchasing quality
 (by purchasing more quality or making some discrete choices) and ii) the
 extent to which they choose to save for future stocks rather than to overspend
 on higher quality in the current time period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we can view status as long-term utility, then the effect of the needs
 of the consumer and the structure of market prices for assets and quality
 can be incorporated into the utility model.
 For example, we know that costs of the owned assets (long-term durable
 goods - abbreviated as LTDG from here on) are much higher compared to the
 quality consumption and would have a more definite impact on the consumer's
 long-term utility as they are a more certain indicator of the stability
 of her income.
 To standardise the LTDG options available to the consumer, we may order
 the LTDG in the respective markets based on their costs of acquisition.
 Using a discrete model of utility, the differences in the costs of two
 successive LTDG in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cost-order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for LTDG would affect the substitutability between acquisition of durable
 goods and quality consumption to the consumer as the consumer may give
 up hopes of acquiring assets if her income is expected to follow a trajectory
 of a low income group.
 Thus, if a consumer wishes to improve long-term utility of status, a higher
 difference between two successive LTDG costs is likely to make the consumption
 of quality more feasible to the consumer- whereas low differences would
 make the acquisition of LTDG easier.
 In this case, as in other, both the relative income of the consumer and
 the prices of items to be consumed in the local market have an effect on
 the consumer's demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we do rely on many of the insights from behavioural economics, we
 note that decision making under risk is far easier when probabilities are
 known.
 Given a list of known probabilities, one can consider how the consumer
 behaves.
 But the issue with uncertainty is that there the probability of change
 in political - are all fundamentally guesses.
 We therefore rely on the framework provided by the subjective probability
 approaches.
 We put forward the claim the probability of promotion is indicated through
 consumption of quality derive the measures for tendency to save.
 In a limited context for the current chapter, we provide a non-stochastic
 model and define the parameters in the Euler Equation for asset growth
 that are controlled by the consumer while associating observed probabilities
 of status growth with consumption of quality.
 In this simple model, the exogenous process for income is also viewed as
 non- stochastic\SpecialChar endofsentence
 We therefore assume that a consumer knows her expected
 income path given her education, skills and social background (by the time
 she is of working age).
 The model we develop is then matched with the assets acquired, the quality
 (interpreted in terms of total per need unit).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, we attempt to view status-related consumption in a conventional
 model for consumer demand.
 An interpretation of status consumption is possible, if we base ourselves
 on the assertion that for status-related consumption to exist, status must
 appear in the long-term utility for the rational consumer in a model.
 For a rational consumer to spend on status consumption, she must see some
 status utility from consumption in the long-term or the short-term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recent literature suggests that in societies undergoing economic upheavals
 (e.g.
 introduction to global markets, industrialisation), the poorer social identitie
s may try to cross previously imposed barriers through consumption (bandwagon
 effect) while those with richer social identities would attempt to guard
 their status through consumption (snob effect).
 The observation that we rely on is that separating oneself from others
 through consumption (when all else fails) minimises one's own perceived
 risk (if not the actual risk) of moving away from the high-income group.
 Status consumption - in this sense - is likely to exist in any economy
 where social stratification exists.
 We make a conscious attempt to not take an ideological stance on whether
 status consumption is wasteful or a consequence of a belief in social mobility.
 Instead of claiming whether status shows the consumers' long-termism or
 a short-term termism, ours is merely an attempt to endogenise the role
 that social identities may play in consumption.
 Interpreting quality as the distance of expensive nondurable consumption
 (ENDC) from the minimum cost of needs, we argue that status in the short-run
 can only be achieved through relative quality of consumption.
 We then test whether the preference for quality increases with changes
 towards industrialisation or if it is more likely that quality is used
 to compensate for not having as much status and durable goods (LTDG) as
 others.
 Comparing quality metrics from across different economic strata (classified
 in terms of occupation-rank or education levels) of a cross-section, we
 developed a framework test how the preference for quality may vary across
 populations segregated through levels of development or social identities.

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
There are two threads in the literature - one where habits or myopia is
 noticed, life-cycle model is modified and the other where more empirical
 literature where factors affecting consumption is identified.
 The latter can be explained with the former if the income and permanent
 income is.
 This was the intention of the permanent income model by Friedman who wanted
 to study 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

non-human
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth of individuals.
 Status consumption can be understood if we extend the uncertainty in consumer
 choice and include status consumption as part of the long-term utility
 of the consumer.
 Status is defined as the risk-adjusted net worth of the individual - while
 an attempt is made to distinguish perceived probability from observed probabili
ty.
 The distinction between the two is how we extend the permanent income model
 - which does not assume any social hierarchy - by focusing only on volatility
 of income (and the assumptions thereof).
 A subjective probability view of status - may provide us a model for quality
 and assets - that contribute to the status i.e.
 the relative positioning with respect to others.
 The consumption is related to status only through two ways - quality and
 assets.
 Fulfillment of needs is private and by definition is same for everybody.
 Whatever is not considered basic needs may vary for the society.
 Balancing the two over time motivates a model for life-cycle - which has
 been extended for behavioural problems by Thaler.
 The theory for visible consumption can be understood in terms of this asset
 and quality model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HOW IS THIS ABOUT STATUS CONSUMPTION?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature from behavioural economics, marketing research and development
 economics all seem to concur on the tendencies of habit formation in consumers.
 The measurement of changes in habits and quality has had a long tradition
 in neoclassical economics (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment of the problem).
 Of particular interest is the model for myopia amongst consumers described
 by Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."

\end_inset

 who notes the significance of lagged consumption on aggregate consumption.
 In more recent studies using the intertemporal substitution setting in
 a life-cycle context, a rational utility-optimising consumer balances between
 the non-durable and durable consumption based on her planned savings over
 her life-time - a problem often treated equivalent to the classical utility
 maximising consumption problem.
 Improving upon the classical approach where the consumer is subservient
 to her optimised plan for life-time savings and consumption, a few behavioural
 approaches (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

 for example) have attempted to model the rules of mental accounting and
 descriptive behavioural factors such as willpower in consumers to better
 understand the development of habits.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the behavioural theories, the representativ
e consumer in such models is subject to overeating, overspending, accumulating
 items she doesn't need or acquiring habits she cannot afford.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thread of literature on consumption that is more empirical in nature
 has observed how social identities play a role in status-signalling.
 Empirical studies in both the developed world and the developing countries
 find social group identities relevant to status-related consumption (see

 We believe that a behavioural model - if used with justified reference
 points (see Markowitz
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) for status-related consumption - should connect the two threads and provide
 a better understanding of conspicuous consumption in terms of the theory
 of decision under risk.

 Wth a framework of social ranking and signaling therewith, Robert Frank

 is relative to lower or similar income-groups (rather than relative to
 higher income groups) .

Income differences and status are not connected well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There may be a need to tread with caution when looking at demand of items
 in the developing countries that are considered conspicuous in the developed
 countries - where relative wealth differences are more relevant for status
 difference.
 As the wealth differences are much larger and the industrial development
 much more concentrated in a developing country, the glaringly visible and
 sufficiently local (dense) wealth differences may have far more  weight
 than the status items a rational consumer would purchase (see Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 for criticism of a 
\shape italic

view of status consumption ).
 On the other hand, rapid industrialisation and transformation of consumer
 markets in many developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia may
 result in both a narrowing of income differences (or expansion of industrial
 sector) and introduction of items for status-related consumption significant
 enough to make Veblen's dated insights on status relevant in our times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sociological studies have long indicated the role that industrial goods
 and income rises play on the addressing of status needs by the consumers
 (see Srinivas

 , Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 ).
 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "SrinivasSanskritization"

\end_inset

 noted an instance of Veblen's pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

 (referred to as 
\shape italic

) as the erstwhile lower classes emulated the habits of higher social classes
 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, the habits of the upper economic classes were similarly
 observed to have expanded to the middle and lower classes in the decades
 after the second world war.In the post-feudal societies all over the world
 where markets have developed, a new working class can be observed to have
 replaced the feudal or colonial order of the century before.
 Still, while this setting is not unrelated to the one that Veblen had described
 in his treatise on conscpicuous consumption, there are many ways in which
 the context of the sub-Saharan African context is different from the American
 gilded age.
 For the most part, we believe, the status consumption in the developing
 countries may be mere indications of wealth (see Khamis et al.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The questions in the consumer surveys (which is how a researcher may obtain
 the list of visible items) - are adjusted to find items that may indicate
 wealth.
 The criteria of what items are of visible importance is not enough for
 identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth differences
 are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible way to related income differences, urban concentration with the
 wealth plans of the consumer in a model is to introduce the consumer's
 uncertainty related to them.
 This is the appraoch adopted by many recent studies on urban migration
 and development.
 A model of notable popularity - explaining urban and rural interactions
 in the developing countries - is the Lewis model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GollinLRF"

\end_inset

 which views urban migration as a necessary phase of development - leading
 to a competition between industrial and agricultural sectors for labour
 and food (it predicts the prices of food to rise as labour moves from agricultu
re to industry).
 In the Lewis model, a worker/farmer is meant to maximise her income and
 reduce the risk associated with it as she is faced with the choice of migration
 to the urban areas.
 Since a flight to urban areas is not merely an escape from despondent circumsta
nces but an access to expanded consumption basket and a (perceived) promise
 of social mobility as well - one could enhance the model by refining the
 migration incentives and associating uncertainties associated with them.
 This approach align with the observations on demand by the literature on
 consumption from the development countiries.

The task of setting reference point for necessities (often used to separate
 risk-seeking behaviours from risk-averse ones) in a study of consumption
 microdata is more challenging than what one faces in a controlled behavioural
 experiment - foremost due to the consumption microdata being far coarser
 and sparser than what one could obtain in a lab experiment.

 There are exceptions where reference points can be set in a non-controversial,

The above is not always possible - the macroeconomic factors and issues
 of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) in the two economies
 may be so intertwined with the demand that a comparison of demand for status
 consumption is not possible without a standard definition of what we mean
 by status-consumption and needs across cultural contexts in the two countries
 (assuming that the macroeconmics variables could be compared) .
 the quality of consumption microdata in the developing countries has its
 limitations.
 If we assume that data was available and that it was possible to standard
 way of macroeconomics inputs (welfare, growth , savings rate) as well as
 human needs , there are more difficult problem is the standardisation of
 status consumption which is subject to cultural contexts.
 We have struggeled to find a general definition of what may constitute
 status-related consumption that we need in order to standardise the demand
 for non-status and status requirements in the two countries is .
 The conspicuous consumption studies often make varied assumptions about
 what to include as part of conspicuous consumption and what not to.
 Some studies, for example, include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in the status-related items while others don't.
 In some cases, studies employ a consumer basket identified from a different
 economy on the basis of items being of conspicuous values by common knowledge.
 Except when a survey is used to identify

The approach to visible consumption is tractable - particulary model provided

 With a simplifying assumption (probably less feasible in the developing
 world), an escape from the poor quality of income data for economies having
 large informal sectors and contractual work arrangements.
 A particular limitation of the visibility models (such as the Ireland model)
 is worth paying attention - the separation of visible consumption from
 non-visible consumption in the models assumes that conspicuous consumption
 brings no utility in the regular sense (we refer to this assumption as
 the futility assumption henceworth - an argument often attributed to Veblen).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items as one good.

, we seek items that may be associated with a general belief in mobility
 of the consumer rather than quality of visibility in items.
 Our argument views an ontological sense of status which encompasses the
 consumer's preference to long-term protection and hence the risk associated
 with the promotion to a state of higher income and assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To consider an ontological sense of status - we bank upon the empirical
 studies in health and sociological sciences that often track status with
 a vector of income, education and occupation (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

 for examples).
 A research can view status as simply the risk-adjusted net worth of the
 individual - i.e.
 the total net-worth combined with the risk or 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability associated with the transition to the highest band of net-worth.
 An attractive feature of a view of status as risk-adjusted net-worth of
 the individual is that one can quantify the extent to which the social
 identities may influence the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 (historical) probability of moving towards high-income - side by side how
 skills, occupations and income may contribute to risk-adjusted net-worth
 of the individual.
 In an ontological sense, high-status individual is thus someone who has
 either or both of high income and a high (inter-generational) 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability to move towards the high income group (stability).
 In the same ontological sense, a low-status individual is someone who has
 either or both of low net worth and a low 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability of transition to high net worth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways in which this definition of status is improper.
 First, for the risk-associated with net-worth changes and the net-worth
 itself to be relevant for status, they ought to be considered in a particular
 social unit e.g.
 a family, community, town, region or country.
 Second, the individual's consumption or the perception of status is drive
 not just by the net-worth adjusted according to observed financial risks
 - but by how she perceives her future states of wealth.
 Therefore, status-signaling through consumption - whenever it exists -
 is shaped by the consumer's perception of risk - rather than the sense
 of status that may be determined by a researcher.
 The first issue may be dealt empirically but the second issue requires
 us to reconsider the definition of status for a model based on observed
 probabilty - since a consumer is not motivated by the historical probability
 alone.
 In fact, if there is a common theme across the conspicuous consumption
 studies, it is the disproportionate expenditure on visible goods by those
 perceived to have lower status.
 This is best explained a high 
\shape italic
perceived 
\shape default
probability (i.e.
 higher than 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability) of status promotion through consumption.
 While the barriers in form of income, social identity (and the combinations
 thereforth) - which constitute the social hierarchy in an economy- may
 motivate status consumption, the consumer's view of the barriers is through
 the social psychological communication which may not offer the same view
 as the researcher.
 In essence therefore, a consumer may view these barriers differently from
 how a researcher measures them.
 For example, the perceived threat of immigration may cause the

\shape default
 probability of one's lower status state to be higher than the 
\shape italic

\shape default
 one that the researcher may measure much the way an over-reliance on conspicuou

 A desired refinement to our notion of status is offered by the subjective

 in purchasing power between sections of a society as well as their desire
 for mobility can drive consumption and economy.
 Ever since, the free-market view of economic progress has relied on letting
 this exchange between the rich and poor sections thrive

 If we don't draw a distinction between the perceived and observed probabilities
 of social mobility, it makes sense to assume that households optimise expenditu
re based on future income expectations which they develop based on the observati
ons of past mobility.
 The free market school would argue that a lower status (i.e.
 lower asset possession or lower education) would make the consumer more
 interested in saving for high-cost assets or invest in characteristics
 that enhance her success and less interested in indicating status through
 high quality in certain categories (e.g.
 luxury items) that are meant to accompany high-status.
 On the other hand, if the consumers cannot view the true observed probability
 of their mobility, then their wants (which they estimate through a perceived
 probability ) would not achieve their true needs

The difference between the long-term and short-term expectations of the
 consumers form the basis of our model - so that the long-term needs of
 the consumers are aligned with the observed probability of mobility and
 the short-term needs - which amount to improving the quality of consumption
 - are aligned with the perceived probability of their long-term growth.

While an improvement in quality in the short-term may imply forgoing the
 future asset growth, the consumer's equilibirum are subject to shocks as
 fundamental changes in the economy.
 More particularly, the changes such as rapid industrilisation and centraliseed
 or exapansion of markets and instittuions would cause both an increase
 in uncertainty and a changes in reference levels for the consumer.
 Thse chagnes are te context that the literature on conscpiucous consumption

 The fundamental claim of permanent income is that income has a transitory
 and permanent componenet where the consumption is directly proportional
 to the permanent component.
 In many ways, our approach is - smoothening of income approach.
 Here, the low-income individual may have too much uncertainty with her
 income - requiring her to maintain buffer stock for her needs in a way.
 This model works does model relative wealth - largely ignoring the belief
 or movement between the status

 has very clearly stated that his intention to focus only on non-human wealth
 in the uncertainty after acknowledging that many types of wealth exist
 on which the degree of uncertainty may vary.
 Friedman is also clear about the equivalence of the believed uncertainty
 and the mean observed levels.
 Friedman also relies on transitory component being counter-balanced by
 permanent component - the permanent income theory is based independence
 (zero-correlation) or transitory component with the permanent component
 - a much stronger component than what we may require.
 Friedman too considers inheritance as an increase in the permanent income
 - which we explcitly model as assets.
 Friedman views observed income as the sum of transitory and permanent income
 components - assuming that permanent (long-term ) consumption is a fixed
 proportion of the permanent income.
 Friedman's empirical analysis observes the dispersion if income amongst
 social classes - (gauged with a simple variance in past income).
 That one should observe the dispersion in quality as well motivates much
 of our study.

\begin_layout Standard
As far as conspicuous consumption is conerned, the permanent income hypothesis
 does not explain why the low-income does not always encourage high saving
 .
 In fact, it can be said that a rational consumer predicting future incomes
 based on the past incomes, has no reason to engage in any status related
 consumption (neither in short-term nor in long-term) as she knows all about
 her future plans.
 Our approach differes from a permanent income in two fundamental ways.
 First, we attach a probabilistic advantage to the status consumption -
 for if there is indeed nothing to be gained by status-related consumption
 (the assumption of conspicuous consumption being essentially futile - as
 was argued by Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"

\end_inset

), then there is no way for the rational consumer to derive any utility
 from status-related consumption.
 While uncertainty in the permanent income hypothesis is limited to the
 volatility of income, we model uncertainty as transitition probability
 of states of wealth and status
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In discounting the role that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 wealth i.e.
 a higher status would play in an economy, Friedman in fact goes to the
 lengths of viewing a society where human wealth matters as a slave society.
 As the modern society is a non-slave society, a focus on non-human wealth
 may be adequate - the argument goes.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Second, we consider the probability of income different from probability
 of accumulatio of assets - allowing the consumer to have a probability
 .
 The transitory compnent is not completely unrelatd to long-term growth
 in our model.
 To improve her long-term utility, the consumer can thus either save for
 LTDG or spending on some level of quality (ENDC) based on her perception
 of the value she attaches to conspicuous consumption.
 The can thus be uncertainty associated with growth in income, needs and
 assets.Since the materialisation of a consumer's future plans is probablistic,
 consumer owuld spend the amount corresponding to her belief in conspicuous
 consumption not according to a transitory component that shold be ignored
 but signify her belief.
 In a real economy, no one truly known the probabilty of chagne in one's
 states, a consumer may be more confident about her income than of the improveme

 approach with their behavioural life-cycle hypothesis.
 In the context of status consumption which we are concerned with, the mere
 existence of conspicuous consumption proves that there is some utility
 to be derived by spending what is not rationally advantageous to the consumer,
 regardless of how one may model the deviation from the optimal plan.

 consumption.
 It only aspires to include the latter in a wider concern for status and
 income.
 By means of an analogy, let's consider the market for cars where status
 is signalled through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption might tell us that the consumers
 pay more attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would also want to see i) the constraints on occupation
 and income that exist in the respective areas and ii) the price differences
 in the cars being sold in the market.
 In our original problem of status consumption, while it may be true that
 individuals spend more on their outward appearances (despite controlling
 for everything else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not
 all what the expectation of status consumption over time may comprise of
 (see the Figure

 and Eastman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Eastman1999"

\end_inset

 for the terminology around status consumption).
 As argued before, the conscpicuous consumptin is more than visible consumption
 for us.
 Therefore, not all ENDC we find is considered visible.
 For example, some higher quality non-durable consumption may not be visible
 in nature must accompany higher durable consumption that may in turn be
 visible.
 For example, a house in the right neighborhood may indicate private schooling
 and eating out etc.
 - so while higher quality non-durable consumption need not be visible by
 itself (such as using electricity in Tanzania) the durable consumption
 associated with it (electrical equipment etc.) may be visible.
 Similarly, while a visible item is effectively a high-quality item in our
 framework, not all visible consumption qualifies as ENDC either.
 Thus, visible long-term asset (which is passed down from generations) would
 be considered simply as an asset in our model.
 The asset being visible is important only on grounds of it being a higher-price
d asset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One thus needs to consider both assets and non-durable consumption to view
 visible consumption within our framework.
 Once the consumer preferences for needs across different commodity groups
 and the assets she acquires are considered, visibility can viewed as the
 preference order for quality across the groups.
 More particularly, as prices of commodities change or new goods are introduced,
 the consumer may adjust her quality of total consumption based on a preference
 order over the commodity groups - e.g.
 a consumer may consider quality for transport more important than quality
 in food (or vice versa).
 Once the consumer's basic needs are fulfilled, the consumer is likely to
 prefer one commodity group over the other to compromise on or overspend
 on.
 Visibility can be seen as a part of this order.
 The commodities such as food being less visible than household or entertainment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term needs does
 not view status consumption as futile but relates it with an expectation
 of social mobility - which the consumer considers after fulfilment of basic
 needs and which is influenced both with long-term possessions and non-durable
 consumption.
 The relevance of a social-identity to status is modeled through an expectation
 of high status through a history of past LTDG ownership, incomes/occupations
 (a criterion that makes the consumer raise her expectations through association
 with the identity).

The consumer is set to optimise her long-term utility inclusive of status.
 Here, the role of wealth in terms of assets is important.
 We model with needs, quality and assets.
 Long-term needs are due to observed probability and short-term needs are
 due to perceived probability.
 The consumer gains something from both.
 The former is more definite than the latter.
 Empirically, the long-term and short-term needs are separated with how
 the items can be passed on in a life-cycle model.
 Rich and poor all benefit from status consumption - and we don't really
 need to know who actually believes in it.
 The substitution exists between long-term assets and quality in the current.
 The consumption is increased - but we explicitly use a quality control
 to see how the consumer should increase quality.
 The theory cannot be used to compare two economies as such - without comparing
 how the consumer's uncertainty which she would change - a problem to be
 taken up when a Bayesian estimation is performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Status as utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The utility function property from which much of the model would follow
 is that status - defined as a measure of stable high net-worth - is constituted
 in the consumer's utility.
 If not, the model's representative consumer would have no reason to engage
 in status-related consumption in the short-term.
 That the consumer may deviate from her long-term plans introduces an explicit
 uncertainty in the model with the consumer's decision making due to her
 limited knowledge of the future states.
 At the same time, the growth of her income process - which is characteristics
 of an economy - is associated with an uncertainty different from the consumer's
 subjective uncertainty - thereby allowing the representative consumer in
 the model to assign a higher probability to landing in a state of higher
 status than what is known through more deterministic trends of income to
 the researcher.
 In decision theoretic terms, one can say that consumer's risk-seeking behaviour
 for lower payoffs relative to higher payoffs (and risk-aversion for higher
 payoffs compared to lower) given a choice between saving and quality is
 likely to be known to the market - which may transform the consumer's perceived
 probability of promotion of her status/net-worth through consumption.
 Thus, even though the assets may be surer way to achieve status i.e.
 indicate wealth and achieve security - they would require more will-power
 and patience to accumulate whereas quality may appear relatively more affordabl
e and accessible through markets e.g.
 a low-income individual may be less likely to buy a luxury car in the developed
 market but may still be willing to compromise on other needs if a rental
 luxury car is made available and advertised aggressively through marketing
 campaigns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there is something to be gained - however little - from status-consumption
 (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a consumer can achieve
 higher-status state in the model both by the acquisition of assets (which
 is assisted with higher income) and by the less definite means of increasing
 chances of status promotion through social interactions (the latter requiring
 higher quality relative consumption).
 In the long-term, the wealth (status or assets) the consumer acquires would
 eventually be aligned with the income process while her short-term view
 would have addressed the demand for needs and quality through non-durable
 consumption.
 Thus the role of non-durable consumption is two-fold in our model - first,
 it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer and second, it also matches
 the consumer's (subjective) perception of her own trajectory of status
 promotion through high-quality consumption.
 Quality consumption is therefore not simply hedonic
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenImplicitHedonic1974,DeatonEconConsumer"

\end_inset

 in our view but it also improves the consumer's chances of status promotion
 - albeit with less certainty than what would be possible through acquisition
 of long-term assets.
 In other words, quality or expensive non-durable consumption must provide
 both felicity in the present and a less definite likelihood of improving
 social networks (than that from long-term assets) to the consumer.
 Since non-durable consumption is always less expensive than long-term assets,
 a consumer is likely to overspend on quality - as she assigns a higher
 probability to success through social interactions.

 The first uncertainty, i.e.

 While short-term requirements of the consumers are subject to the perception

 the

 Conceptually, this is not so different from how transitory components of
 income are expected to cancel out in the permanent income approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"

\end_inset

.
 What we have introduced is the separation of consumer's uncertainty about
 the income process (an uncertainty that results in deviation from needs
 as high quality consumption) from the uncertainty in the process of social
 mobility - while tracking the two with different variables in the econometric
 analyses.
 The purpose of considering two levels of uncertainty is to allow the representa
tive consumer to deviate from her long-term plans (which are themselves
 assumed to be exogenous in the model and contribute to the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 uncertainty).
 In this sense, our approach is different from the permanent income approach
 - instead of arguing for the transitory component (which ENDC are the equivalen
t of) to be independent of the permanent component (which the LDTG are an
 equivalent of), we seek a mechanism delineating how the two may interact
 in a life-cycle model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recap, the two uncertainties in the model are needed only because we
 wish to include status in the model and wish to model that the consumer
 would deviate from her long-term plans with an uncertainty systematically
 different from the one that is associated with the income process which
 would drive her wealth.
 It is worth pausing a moment and asking if conspicuous consumption can
 really be view simply as the consumer's error in judgment and if conspicuous
 consumption is simply a general deviation from basic needs.
 First, by tracking consumer's deviation from her needs and thus equating
 consumption of quality with 
\shape italic
perceived
\shape default
 probability, we don't actually make any descriptive claims about the consumer's
 belief - ours is only a way to differentiate between the probabilities
 of the income process and that of deviation from fulfillment of basic needs.
 Second, if conspicuous consumption appears trivialised by being considered
 nothing more than higher-quality consumption, it is largely because it
 is presented in the public discourse as essentially only-serving-the-rich.
 The vast literature on conspicuous consumption describes a conspicuous
 item as one that is used both to distance oneself from the others and to
 emulate the behaviour of those above oneself.
 Yet it is also supposed to be futile in the sense that its benefit is limited
 to a public image of the consumer (i.e it has no value in a private view
 - an argument made fervently while recommending a pigouvian tax on conspicuous
 consumption).
 Indeed, this futility argument would seem at odds with our model's representati
ve consumer whose investment in conspicuous items may (possibly) lead to
 improvement of her social network and of her stable income.
 There are two primary objections we have with the futility view.
 First, we argue that what conspicuous items may offer to a consumer is
 more than just a public image - i.e.
 a public image can have private utility.
 A luxury watch may be futile for private use by itself (when compared to
 cheaper alternatives), but if an aspiring businessman uses his knowledge
 of luxury watches to find new clients for her business, then the futile
 consumption can translate into a material advantage.
 One may still consider conspicuous consumption futile but in a sense that
 is different from what a modeler should be concerned with.
 Items like luxury watches are indeed important only because the rich flock
 around them.
 Thus, if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
 However, the probabilistic utility that conspicuous items may offer is
 important as it acts as a means of connecting the rich with the not-so
 rich.
 We therefore view conspicuous consumption as part of high-quality consumption
 which offers an advantage to the representative consumer that is only driven
 by a small chance (with the consumer likely to overestimate the probability
 of her success).
 In the example of luxury watches, we know that only a few of the purchasers
 of luxury watches would improve their self-image and enhance their social
 networks - others would remain mere purchasers.
 As we have earlier clarified, we are not concerned with how many of the
 businessmen actually believe that conspicuous consumption would help them
 (no attempt to describe behaviour) - as we only observe how many buyers
 of luxury watches actually achieve success over the long term.
 Their purchase of luxury watches would indicate their perceived probability
 of success while the rises in their incomes would indicate the observed
 probability where the characteristics other than luxury watch ownership
 may dominate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason why we argue for non-futility of conspicuous consumption
 is that the advantage which status consumption offers is not limited to
 the rich alone.
 One often describes status consumption as something that helps the rich
 distance themselves from others.
 Viewing status consumption as more than just visible consumption, we argue
 instead that such a utility to the rich may in fact be quite little since
 the rich consumer already has enough to distance herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it would
 offer to those trapped in lower-asset ownership in an environment of low
 social mobility.
 An argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich would also rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't
 have anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to
 leave anyone behind).
 With the model we propose, we argue that the poorest may want to indicate
 that they are not the poorest (much the way richest may want it to be known
 to the others that they are indeed the richest)

\end_inset

.
 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increases awareness of items
 through advertisement, status consumption is needed for everybody - as
 everyone in the middle must both try to avoid getting poorer and try to
 become the richest.
 In conclusion, status consumption must always be considered in relation
 to the consumer's existing wealth and status in order to understand what
 it may offer to the consumer.
 We attempt to quantify this benefit with respect to role that long-term
 assets and needs would play towards the consumer's long-term utility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirically, the long-term assets are what reconcile two uncertainties -
 the items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 and considering those that cannot be passed - short-term.
 The observed probability is contributed to by the assets transferred between
 generations in the long-run as there is little more than the net asset
 worth of the individual - whose probability is determined by factors more
 tangible than perception i.e.
 factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.
 - that are passed over as inheritance.
 The subjective probability of success through social interactions and high
 quality consumption need not matter in the long-term as the path to net
 asset worth may completely ignore the non-durable consumption habits of
 of the past.
 Unlike with a permanent income approach, two uncertainties are not independent
 but are reconciled by transfer and ownership of long-term assets in the
 economy.

\begin_layout Subsection
The outline of a utility function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having associated quality with less certain perception of social connections
 and ownership of long-term assets with more certain parameters of growth
 income, we can now consider how consumer may achieve both in the context
 of needs and prices.
 Our view of status consumption is essentially that of non-necessary consumption
 - and thus empirically, it must rely on a sound definition of needs - which
 provide the reference point for quality in the model.
 That there must be the idea of universal needs is a contentious issue to
 say the least.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (Townsend's view
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"

\end_inset

) while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs can supersede
 her subjective interests (wants).
 We lean towards taking an objective approach which considers autonomy itself
 - in addition to health - as a basic need of the consumer without shunning
 the idea that the needs across cultural contexts should be standardised.
 This is indeed the view presented by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When considering quality in food, this seems a relatively easy task as we
 may just consider the cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs,
 fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area.
 For contexts other than food, what constitutes basic needs is less trivial.
 For example, what constitutes a basic house or a basic set of furniture
 would require some justification.
 Standardising needs as cost of non-durable consumption poses another issue
 - the non-durable consumption may depend on the long-term assets that the
 consumer possesses.
 For non-durable consumption in the household category for example, a consumer
 with more electrical equipment would need more electricity (and the consumer
 that does not own any electrical assets would not need any electricity).
 To get around the issue, we make sure the needs are standardised at the
 asset level rather than at the level of non-durable consumption and attach
 a quality requirement (constraint) for the level of asset ownership that
 the consumer achieves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth reasserting that status is not a need using our approach.
 Instead, it resides in the demand for quality by the consumer as well as
 the asset level acquired by the consumer while the basic needs are independent
 of the wealth of the consumer.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both assets
 and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and income of the
 consumer (rather than high-class or low-class needs of the consumer).
 As an example, the difference between the status of a rich and that of
 a poor family in our model is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 the family combined with a demand for quality for education (with a higher
 price for higher quality).
 Empirically, a straightforward way to proxy the needs of the family is
 by number of members in the family (adjusted by their age).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a reference point of needs is established, quality is viewed simply
 a measure of how far in price the consumer would deviate from the reference.
 Consequently, the utility of the consumer is a non-decreasing function
 of assets owned, the needs of the consumer and the quality demanded.We write
 this as 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\eta,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a certain order of preference that is maintained across the three.
 By the definition of needs, the consumer cannot compromise on needs to
 address quality or asset accumulation.
 The consumer may want to improve quality instead of entering into saving
 assets - but quality itself is constrained and therefore quality may not
 be improved beyond a certain point until more assets are purchased.
 On the other hand, the consumer may want to improve quality (now) if she
 has given up hopes of acquiring assets in the long-term.
 For example, looking at the household category again, the consumers would
 get more utility by upgrading the furniture but she may improve furniture
 instead of buying a bigger house until a certain point - beyond which she
 may need a bigger house to improve the furniture (thus being encouraged
 to save).
 While the utiltiy may be a non-decreasing function of both quality (spread
 across all commodity groups) and assets may be non-decreasing functions,
 the dependence of the two on each need to be explicitly modeled - the details
 of which are presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ModelDynamics"

\end_inset

.
 For now it suffices to say that more asset inequality in an economy may
 increase the focus on quality (as consumers would more often give up hopes
 of acquiring more assets in the long-run).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An issue that we have briefly touched upon earlier is that long-term assets
 themselves may have quality differences - particularly since markets may
 evolve to make high-cost assets accessible to the non-richest consumers
 by introducing cheaper alternatives.
 So far, we have viewed a high-quality asset as merely a more expensive
 asset and quality differences in assets can complicate things - as a consumer
 might want to have high quality consumption now rather than a low quality
 asset later.
 But since higher quality choices often tend to accompany higher-quality
 assets - in fact high-quality consumption is often simply unavailable until
 a high-quality asset is purchased (or due to a long-term characteristic
 e.g.
 education, housing, identity, region due to segregation, trade barriers
 etc.).
 Thus while the quality differences in assets makes substitution between
 saving for durable consumption and quality in non-durable consumption non-trivi
al, the substitution between low-quality asset and high-quality non-durable
 consumption is limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can consider how price derivatives may enter the utility and consumer
 decision.
 Without price changes, the consumption of quality would change only when
 individuals acquire long-term durable goods or give up hopes of acquiring
 costlier assets (possibly due to other needs).
 As the consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality, a rise in
 quality must come either from an increase in income or from an undercut
 in savings.
 Similarly, if needs stay the same, a drop in quality must be due to purchase
 of assets or a drop in income.
 At an empirical level, the prices are attached with a commodity rather
 than overall quality.
 So, to consider price changes, one must consider the price of needs as
 well as the price of quality across the various commodities.
 Therefore, faced with change in prices, a consumer may prefer quality in
 one commodity over another (i.e.
 a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport to food or
 vice versa) as she addresses her needs and long-term assets requirements.
 For example, consider a middle-income family that cuts down on expenses
 (due to loss of income) by moving to a cheaper neighbourhood where the
 rents are lower but the restaurants are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place - so the consumption would either
 shift to saving for a better car or improve quality in some other category
 (better jewelry, better schooling for kids etc.) - assuming the needs of
 the family except indicated by the number of family members haven't changed.
 The sensitivity of consumption with respect to price thus comprises of
 sensitivity with respect to basic needs as well as a sensitivity with respect
 to quality.
 It is both possible and desirable to decompose the demand elasticity in
 this manner.
 How a consumer chooses between savings and quality a part of the intertemporal
 concern.
 In the model we suggest, the representative consumer may both have a myopia
 (e.g.
 she may be likely to switch to electricity or better meat when her income
 increases rather than save for the next available asset) and inertia (e.g.
 she may have a propensity to stick to a long-term choice even though the
 prices increase) in her choices.
 In the Euler equations presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ModelDynamics"

\end_inset

, therefore, the consumption in the next cycle depends on the needs and
 past ownership of assets as well as quality.

Standardisation of demand

\begin_layout Standard
Another advantage of the two uncertainties in our model is that that may
 assist with a comparison of two disparate economies.
 In a general view of status as risk-adjusted net-worth, one could describe
 status as stochastic transition of the its determinants (i.e.
 education, income and identity etc.).
 A Bayesian approach would allow us to model the uncertainty in income growth
 i.e.
 the 
\shape italic
observed 
\shape default
probability (known 
\shape italic
a priori
\shape default
) with respect certain parameters.
 When comparing a developed and a developing economy, for example, the parametri
sation of the strength of state and welfare institutions is of particular
 interest - since it has a definite influence on what may be considered
 of importance for (probabilistic) status
\begin_inset Foot

 considers this as non-personal savings in the permanent income model -
 arguing that business savings and government savings should not be ignored
 in considerations of wealth.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the developed world, the state institutions often intervene when market
 forces aren't directed enough to handle financially risky undertakings
 or to distribute items that are identified as public goods.
 On the other hand, the state institutions are generally weaker in the developin
g world and fail to provide incentives to the private enterprise for distributio
n of public goods.
 When the determinants of status are public goods, the expectation for their
 growth is less risky than when these are not provided as a public good.
 The uncertainty in observed probability can capture this difference as
 we compare developed economy with a developing economy and help separate
 the consumer demand from the disparate economic preconditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate one may perform the comparison for a particular commodity
 using a prior, consider the choice of education whose quality may be vary
 in the market.
 As a consequence of the difference in expectation of growth, education
 may carry more status-value in the developing world than it would in the
 developed world - simply because the distribution of education (and other
 similar assets that may be public goods) are state-assisted in a developed
 country so that the expected risk in levels of education of the progeny
 is lowered.
 How much education may eventually matter towards status in the developed
 economy therefore depend on how consumers set themselves apart in the social
 order based on other determinants of status e.g.
 consumption or social identity (since education may no longer differentiate
 them in the social order).
 On the other hand, when a minimum degree of education isn't guaranteed
 by the state (as is the case in a developing economy), a consumer would
 associate higher risk with the expected growth in education (which can
 be modeled with the 
\shape italic
observed
\shape default
 probability in the income process).
 Thus indirectly, education is more likely to matter for expected status
 (or even income growth) without the state-support in a developing country.
 In a comparison between two economies with different degrees of state support,
 the strength of institutions thus determines the expectation of accumulation
 of public goods (such as family education level) as how much education
 may matter for long-term status is an indirect effect of the strength of
 institutions and is influenced by the evolution of markets that may provide
 the expanded consumption choices to the consumer.
 Two uncertainties allow us to separate out the effects

If one ignores the modeling of a parameter for strength of welfare institutions
 altogether (due to the belief that the demand for conspicuous consumption
 eventually benefits the society as a whole as the money is reinvested for
 the benefit of the poor in exchange for their services), one may still
 parametrise the efficacy of institutions that collect money obtained from
 the rich on conspicuous items and fund employment and other opportunities.

, who have presented a stronger view that the differences between the rich
 and poor have been reduced to a level in the developed world that an exchange
 for status and wealth is no longer lucrative to the poor, we believe an
 empirical view of such an exchange is desirable.
 While the level of economic inequalities have indeed narrowed in the developed
 world since the 18th century, we have found it difficult to verify the
 claims that price of luxuries has exceeded the opportunity cost to the
 rest of the society empirically - due to disparate political risks, technologic
al advancements and the social contexts of the two eras in comparison.

Model Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have the following features we want in a model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
A model for needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This would be the life-cycle assumption.
 The consumer knows how her needs are going to grow until the end of her
 lifetime.
 This applies even if we model household as the unit (a dynasty rather)
 consider the needs over an infinite time-horizon.
 The idea of needs is an objective one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Assets growth of assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We view asset accumulation as the increments to an asset account - whose
 value is reflected in the total cost of assets inclusive of cash assets
 that the consumer owns.
 This approach treats the accumulation of cash and purchase of assets the
 same.
 In other words, if a consumer sets her eyes on assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, with prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

 and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) from the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model also assume that at the of her lifetime, her personal wealth would
 be exactly - her savings would either be consumed or would be passed on
 to her children.
 While all individuals in the population are assumed to be the same as our
 representative consumer in terms of the preferences for needs over quality,
 they differ in the the starting amount and trends of their salaries, the
 trajectory of their needs, their long-term quality habits and the starting
 values of their asset accounts.
 Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all assets in
 the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success to preferences
 being the same for everybody) which provides furniture, housing and all
 amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every asset and service - offered as life-long subscription - is purchased
 by giving an amount to this company.
 We ignore the depreciation of assets for the moment for simplicity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Credit or borrowing in the market is also assumed to be negligible (an assumptio
n that is not so far fetched in a developing economy).
 The no-credit assumption implies that the consumer can only save to buy
 more of the only asset available in the market.
 Therefore, if the consumer's starting income is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 so that after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working her salary is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}k^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 so that the total income she has earned is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{\tau}i_{j}=\frac{i_{0}k}{k-1}(k^{\tau}-1)$
\end_inset

.
 Now at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased assets from a portion of her income and decided
 that she does not want more assets for the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, her life circumstances might have changed (she may need
 a bigger house or want a more expensive house) thus needing more assets
 urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend both on needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 and asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In a probabilistic model, we would attach a consumer probability of these
 events occurring at different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Empirically, we rely on the separation of the long-term (more stable) needs
 of the consumer from her short-term (more volatile) needs.
 The longer-term assets are what would cause the stability of income while
 non-durable consumption or assets that are not to improve observed probability
 in any possible are classified as the short-term needs.
 An item-by-item analysis of the life-expectancy of all owned items is possible.
 The average life-time of a product being consumed is a more objective measure
 than its status-carrying potential (which one would record in a survey).
 Whatever can't be passed on isn't long-term and would not cause any observable
 change in mobility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A non-stochastic model, there may not be a way to differentiate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of income being governed by social class or education from the uncertainty
 in the the income process.
 When there is no uncertainty about the income process to the consumer,
 the real income process and the consumer's action which are known by 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conspicuous consumption is driven not by the income process itself but
 the knowledge that most individuals withing that class, educational level
 etc.
 are going to end up a certain way is what determines the consumer choice.
 An income process derived from personal characteristics - instead of a
 that may give us a more accurate function of the unobserved variables e.g.
 personality types - may be more appropriate.
 This is an aggrement with the life-cycle hypothesis (see Thaler et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"

\end_inset

) where the representative consumer is a risk manager based on her perception
 shaped by long-term developments - rather than somebody who execute long-term
 plans based on a finite wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a simple model of income, consider that income grows at a fixed rate
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 every year.
 Thus assuming that at the start of her working age, her starting income
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

, then her salary over the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}=i_{0}k^{t}$
\end_inset

.
 If we attach no uncertainty to the growth of income, as it would be the
 case in a non-stochastic model, the growth rate would remain the same forever
 and is known by the consumer.
 In the stochastic model we would let our consumer maintain a uncertainty
 of both how her annual income unfolds in her future years and the uncertainty
 about her improving being part of a high-consumption club.
 While these uncertainties are turned off in the non-stochastic model, the
 choice of long-term quality against the choice to save for future assets
 in an environment of definite and exogenous income growth in income can
 still be delineated with the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variance specification is also necessary for the permanent income approaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Income process is exogenous.
 A consequence of the exogenous process is that the rich are more likely
 to stay rich than the poor are to become rich (otherwise there would be
 no stratification in the society).
 We would expect total quality per assets to be lower for the rich than
 it is for the poor - whose expectation for the long-term growth is lower
 but they are more likely to overweigh on the probabilistic growth through.

Long-term quality in a non-stochastic setting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key feature of the model is that it deconstructs the consumed quality
 in what is imposed by the market accessible to the consumer and the long-term
 choices she has made.
 Due to the two factors, the choice of quality is constrained.
 We use a parameter only to see how much the consumer choice is affect in
 relation to the long-term choices she has made.
 We explain a model developed with the non-stochastic Euler equations which
 use the parameters we have discussed.
 The non-stochastic model - which we calibrate with the consumption microdata
 - is described with the following equations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\eta_{t+1}=\eta(t,T)\nonumber \\
A_{t+1}=A_{t}+(i_{t}-c_{t})\nonumber \\
i_{t+1}=ki_{t}\nonumber \\
c_{t}=\nu\eta_{t}p(A_{t-1},\rho)\label{eq:nonstoch}
\end{gather}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 represent the consumer needs at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the value of asset account (comprising of cash reserved for assets as
 well as the total value of assets owned), 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are the static household characteristics (educational level, religious
 or social identity etc.), 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the income obtained in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 the consumption in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that in addition to the quality control
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 , the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 also depends on the price of quality that is imposed by the asset choices
 in the past or the household characteristics that are acquired over generations.
 The reason why we separate this cost from the consumer choice of quality
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is that i) certain quality choices are imposed by the asset one possesses
 - e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment etc.
 where avoiding the respective expenses is not an option for the consumer
 and ii) certain long-term choices or characteristics limit the choice to
 avail quality in the short-term.
 In the common usage of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

needs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one may have consider such costs as needs of the consumer, but since our
 notion of needs is based on health and autonomy of the individual, this
 is the only way the costs imposed by the assets and social identities may
 enter in the model.
 Another way to interpret the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 is viewing how a consumer matches her consumption with the assets she owns
 and the long-term characteristics she acquires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the life-time of T years, the consumer optimises the non-stochastic
 sum 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum_{i=1}^{T}\upsilon(c_{i},A_{i},\eta_{i})$
\end_inset

 .
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\ge1$
\end_inset

 to consume the quality she desires.
 The minimum cost for maintaining the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 are meant to be chosen by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=1$
\end_inset

.s Higher the value of the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, higher is the consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and lower is the future growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The control
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be seen as the long-term habit of the consumer and is the only variable
 in the model that is adjusted by the consumer.
 Other than this parameter, the consumption depends both on needs and the
 long-term choices of the consumer (which are encapsulated by the asset
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 the consumer has accumulated in the past and the the personal characteristics
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 she possesses).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see how this may work in an empirical setting, consider the commodities
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0},I_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

 with the respective prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0},p_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}<p_{1}<p_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Further, let 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 be the item with the lowest available quality (hence the minimum price
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

) and the quantity needed for minimum needs be 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 Ignoring the effect of assets accumulation and long-term choices for a
 moment, a consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$

\begin_inset Formula $(q_{10}q_{11})$

 is quantity consumed of item 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}\nu_{2}=\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{2k}$
\end_inset

 In this setting, the value of the control

\end_inset

 represents merely the distance from the fulfillment of the basic needs
 i.e.

 The effect of having constraints on quality due to

 is equivalent to addition and removal of items from the basket respectively.
 If a consumer is in a region where only some of the items of the basket
 of a more urban consumer (who has access to all items) are available to
 the consumer, the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 she chooses is equivalent to removing some items from the urban consumer's
 basket.
 Thus the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can be seen as a filter on the set of prices of a basket of all items (i.e.
 items available at a national level or at the respective top level of granulari
ty) returning the prices over which

 Two further simplifications are made - first, it is assumed that the trajectory
 of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t,T)$
\end_inset

 is the same for all consumers.
 Second, the control
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is viewed as a proportion of income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 These allows us to reformulate the non-stochastic equations as follows:

For the dynamic optimisation problem of maximising 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{T}u(c_{i},A_{i},\eta_{i})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}\ge c_{t}$
\end_inset

 to ensure that the consumer does not exercise the choice to sell assets
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 in order to consume.
 The constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}\ge c_{t}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\nu\ge1$

\begin_inset Formula $1\le\nu\le\frac{1}{mA_{t}^{a}\eta_{t}}$

 If the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 Since the consumer does not exercise any choice of

Another way to solve a non-stochastic intertemporal problem is by drawing
 an equivalence between total wealth with total outlay in the classical
 consumer choice problem before using similar econometric methods

Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\beta ln(x)+\gamma ln(p)+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 commonly used in estimation derived effectively from 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x\Rightarrow log(w_{i})=log(p_{i})+log(g(x,p))-log(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Here, with 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,p)$
\end_inset

 as the Marshallian demand function, using the double-logarithmic model
 (which is a mere restatement of existence of elasticities through total
 differentiation), we have 
\begin_inset Formula $log(g(x,p))=\alpha_{i}+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}log(x)+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p)}log(p)$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $log(w_{i})=\alpha_{i}+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}-1)log(x)+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{i})}+1)log(p_{i})+\sum_{j\ne i}\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{j})}log(p_{j})$
\end_inset

 The adding up restriction is more difficult to impose on this form rather
 than the slightly modified :

 An estimation of demand elasticities of consumption can be performed using
 parallel - arguments using the total wealth constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $W$

\end_layout

 In such a formulation, the constraint for the consumer can be stated as
 the total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\delta_{i}(A_{T}+\sum c_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 are the assets accumulated over the period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and the discount factors can be chosen as
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{i}=\frac{1}{1+i}$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 is 0 at the end by the consumer spending everything as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{T}$
\end_inset

 at the end of period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

 Equivalent to the case of income constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}=x$
\end_inset

 for the maximisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\textbf{q})$
\end_inset

, the wealth constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is meant to be known to the representative consumer i.e.
 the consumer chooses a plan for 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i},A_{i}$
\end_inset

 knowing what her total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and future expectations of prices are.
 The demand function would be 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=g(W,p)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the price of consumption.
 The cost of consumption is a combination of both i) the non-decreasing
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 which in turn depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and ii) and the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 which is chosen by the consumer based on the quality of consumption she
 desires.
 In this chapter, we focus on a simulation assisted approach to demonstrate
 what illustrations can be drawn from the model in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the above model notice that we observe 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t},c_{t}$

 as well as the overall quality i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{c_{t}}{\eta_{t}}=\nu i_{t}mA^{\alpha-1}$

 which we estimate using cost of a basket of basic needs (see the details

).
 We estimate the exogenous income process with region, background and other
 household characteristics - so a consumer is expected to know her income
 trajectory through these parameters.
 The goal of the econometric method is to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$

\begin_inset Formula $m$

The obvious limitation of the non-stochastic approach is the independence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 on the degree of uncertainty in the model parameters.
 Therefore, the non-stochastic model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

 disregards the beliefs in social mobility that may motivate increases risky
 behaviour to the consumer.
 As the only way for a consumer to reach a higher status in the non-stochastic
 model is through accumulation of assets i.e.
 growth in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (or change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

), she is likely to settle for low range 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,A$
\end_inset

 (and consequently have low-status) if she wants to keep 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 low and high
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The total wealth constraints ensures this when total wealth (
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 ) is low.
 Therefore by diminishing the role of social mobility, the model over-emphasizes
 the role that the starting value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 plays towards gaining status through 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Attaching some probability of social mobility through education or social
 participation - which is not modeled in the equations

Empirical measurement of quality and needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have hinted in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:nonstochproblem"

\end_inset

, our notion of quality is dependent on what we consider as needs rather
 than the characteristics of items using a hedonic approach (see Rosen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenImplicitHedonic1974"

\end_inset

 for an summary of hedonic approaches).
 We define needs as the standard requirements not meeting which would lead
 to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory argued for by Doyal
 and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"

\end_inset

).
 To the argument that a family can survive on just starch, the counter-argument
 would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the consumer incurred
 by not having protein is definite.
 As far as the model is concerned, the theory of needs is more of a normative
 than descriptive - simply because a consumer may not always want her needs.
 If she forgoes protein and compromises on her health (and probably autonomy)
 in favour of some other needs, the importance of a particular basket -
 and hence the claims based on that basket - would clearly be diminished.
 As a result, the goal of econometric methods we propose is not to argue
 that consumers act according to a certain set of needs (descriptive) but
 only to test whether they act according to a set of needs or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a standard way to view needs can be set, measure for quality as distance
 the cost of the basic needs can be obtained.
 We identify food, energy, shelter (household) and transport as the commodities
 for which needs exist in a developing economy.
 For food, the price of a standard food basket expressed in terms of protein,
 starch, fat and fruits-vegetables is used.
 For energy, a basic calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal
 and lighting is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of
 kerosene (or a cheaper alternative) when available.
 For household, the cost of the minimal house in the locality (amortised
 over the average working life) and the cost of clothing per year is used.
 We use a calorie quota for transport - which can either be provided by
 food (walking) or energy (running fuel-engines).
 The empirical measure of quality is the a measure of how much the consumers
 deviate from the local cost of the standard basket of minimum expenses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be argued that sustenance is possible in a developing economy with
 tattered clothes and intake of raw food.
 This, however, is unlikely to be a serious concern for the model.
 First, the purpose of our standard basket is much narrower in context than
 defining a poverty level - as it only sets a point of reference to see
 how the quality variants of particular commodities are spread across the
 economy.
 Second, the price filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 does take care of lifestyles that are lower than the chosen threshold.
 More particularly, the consumers who don't own assets can have a zero consumpti
on in the model if 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)=0$
\end_inset

 for low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 (or certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 In other words, since a consumer would rather eat cooked food and buy clothes
 than save for asset and eat raw food, the possibility of survival of those
 consuming below our chosen standard basket is not an issue for the model.
 Using similar arguments, we should expect very few consumers to compromise
 over basic food quality by a lot only to purchase electricity or a similar
 asset.
 Since quality often moves together in this manner, it would make sense
 limit much substitution between consumption, assets and quality across
 commodities.
 Hence we permit summation of qualities across commodities and an additive
 utility for the consumer.
 Thus, given 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 categories (e.g.
 food, energy etc.), if we have 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1,t}=\nu_{1}mA_{t-1}^{a}i_{t-1}\eta_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2,t}=\nu_{2}mA_{t-1}^{a}i_{t-1}\eta_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, then we can write:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
c_{t}=\sum_{k=1}^{N}c_{k,t}=(\eta_{t-1}A_{t-1}^{\alpha}m)\sum_{k=1}^{N}\nu_{k}\label{eq:quality_sum}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every household thus responds to the common needs differently by adjusting
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\nu_{k}\}$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\nu_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 While it is possible to evaluate the model in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

 for the different commodity categories (i.e.
 using 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2},\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 etc.) - but we use the combined 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\nu_{k}$
\end_inset

 to explore how overall quality may evolve in an intertemporal setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A specification function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can be accurate only if we have i) detailed price information for all items
 ii) the same level of detail across all local areas considered and iii)
 the asset ownership information for every household.
 With the detailed local structure of market prices (or the information
 about availability), we can decompose consumed quality into what is offered
 by the local characteristics and the choice of quality made by the consumer
 (with the quality control variable
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

).
 The effect of prices on the quality consumed could thus also be viewed
 as what is the change in quality that is offered in the market vs what
 the consumer chooses in the response to change in relative prices structure
 of commodity variants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have briefly discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:nonstochproblem"

\end_inset

, the price and asset level variables - even if available at the consumer
 level - are more likely to be discrete ( e.g.
 the list of assets owned or the list of goods within a commodity).
 For quality, a continuous interpretation is easy to obtain when a mix of
 goods of different qualities is purchased by the consumer.
 For example, a measure of protein quality can be obtained when every consumer
 purchases some quantities of eggs, chicken and beef.
 The discreteness and non-normality of data may become an issue when the
 prices for some goods (e.g.
 beef in the example) rise by a lot relative to the cheaper alternative
 goods or when a particular good is always in short-supply (unavailable)
 in some areas.
 In such cases, the segregation in quality is likely to create jumps in
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 that would make the continuous parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $m,a$
\end_inset

 in the Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

 somewhat of an approximation.
 Still, a low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as low quality variation relative to asset ownership
 (and high otherwise).
 With this interpretation, the model should be able to demonstrate that
 a consumer in a no-electiricity zone may not be forgoing electricity by
 choice (and therefore choosing less energy quality) - she may maintains
 a long-term habit for high quality of energy that is not expressed with
 low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 She may decide to keep electricity consumption low (through 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu)$
\end_inset

 only if her long-term choice (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) or characteristics (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) make electricity available to her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For assets, the discreteness (the list of assets owned by the consumer)
 is ignored as we use the total value of assets held by the consumer as
 part of the input to 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

.
 This allows for a comparison between quality distributions between two
 economies, where the differences in successive LTDG costs (which are an
 indication of how advanced the markets may be in an economy) would appear
 as the difference the parameters of a particular form for 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $m,a$
\end_inset

 in the Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonstochll"

\end_inset

).
 More particularly, one would expect to see the developed markets making
 rental options available for an expensive durable good (LTDG) to the consumer,
 developing new (cheaper) substitutes to reach the consumer or extending
 credit facilities to the consumer.
 This would cause the differences between successive LTDG costs (relative
 to average income) to be lower in the developed world than in the developing
 economies where markets are less developed and seldom offer credit or rentals
 for the LTDG

A discrete model for asset ownership would be revisited in the stochastic
 approach where a consumer may obtain the next asset with a certain probability

 for a simple discrete model for ownership of assets).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 When such a comparison can be made, an implicit assumption is that all
 products (at whatever cost) can be purchased in the developing world -
 so that the quality filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho$
\end_inset

) is the same for the consumer populations in the two economies

 group in the country 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 In Tanzania, for example - the car rental market seems small and the variation
 in the quality of cars being sold may be smaller than in a typical city
 in the developed world.
 Both the total values of assets and the distribution of quality would thus
 influence the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t-1},\rho)$

 and the consumer's preference for quality.

 could thus be compared with an appropriate form of

The Stochastic Utility

The discrete choice utility does not come into until we want to handle the
 effect of long-term choices.
 If we're willing to consider characteristics like education, region, home-owner
ship or occupation as permanent for the representative consumer, then we
 don't need the discrete choice.
 It's only when we use a dynamic model for making these choices - i.e.
 whether a consumer could move to a different locality, buy a house etc.
 is when we need to model the discrete choice.

 buys and asset or not.
 Since we consider

 We only consider the

 we assume that consumer purchases an asset as soon has she has accumulated
 enough value in

McFadden's is essentially a technique to model the discrete choice of a

 In our case, whether the consumer saves for purchasing an asset or not

Results from Stochastic Utility Approaches

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that our notion of quality is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quality of life
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in general - but simply the quality of non-durable consumption.
 The differences in quality of assets can also exist for the consumer but
 we recognise that owned assets are of less importance within certain commodity
 groups (see condition C1).
 To quantify some of these notions of life-style choices through quality
 and assets, we now outline a model for intertemporal choice that would
 be developed further in later sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a long-term direct utility that the consumer optimises such
 that it is a function of the needs, the assets she possesses and the quality
 of her non-durable consumption.
 Considering two consumers in the urban and rural areas with the assets,
 quality and needs being 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{u},\rho_{u},\eta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{r},\eta)$
\end_inset

 respectively (for simplicity, we have set 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{u}=\eta_{r}=\eta$
\end_inset

), a non-decreasing utility would mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}\Rightarrow u(A_{u},\rho_{u})>u(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

.
 It is also possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $(A_{r},\rho_{u})$
\end_inset

 are not defined since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u},\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

 may not be available to the rural consumer.
 Notice that we don't consider income as an input to the long-term utility.
 This is because we assume that the utility of income is realised with the
 purchases of assets and quality.
 For the urban and the rural consumer, as an example, having a refrigerator
 or a car would be more noticeable than the income itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A non-decreasing utility also implies that for a rural consumer who does
 not possess a refrigerator to have the same utility as her urban counterpart,
 she would have to purchase a higher quality i.e.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{u}>A_{r}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(A_{u},\rho_{u},)=u(A_{r},\rho_{r})$
\end_inset

 only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}>\rho_{u}$
\end_inset

.
 While a particular form of this social function 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 may help us understand how a consumer compensates for not having an asset,
 it is the relevance of such choices to the observed consumption data that
 concerns us more in an empirical analysis.
 A utility function that we desire should help us quantitatively explain
 for example - how much more furniture for a rural consumer would make her
 indifferent to owning electrical assets (and less furniture) in an urban
 area.
 It should also explain whether higher priced assets always provide a higher
 long-term utility to a consumer etc..
 With vast differences in income and wealth that exist in many of the developing
 countries, we believe such questions ought to be considered in any discussion
 on consumption of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To model the sharp (discrete) differences in life-style choices and the
 unobservable factors that create them, we introduce an uncertainty in the
 long-term utility - so that our representative consumer who has a higher
 value of owned assets has only a probabilistic higher long-term utility.
 The long-term utility in the model is incremented in a deterministic fashion
 only with the assets that can be transferred over generations (including
 education, language spoken and occupational ranks) while the immediate
 enhancements to felicity, improvement in self-image - all contribute as
 less deterministic factors to the long-term utility.
 Thus our representative consumer may not gain any long-term benefits from
 an immediate felicity and the stochastic factors other than a better self-image
 and social environment which would in turn help her in acquiring assets
 in the longer run.
 We claim that as long as an empirical distinction between quality, needs
 and assets can be made, the consumption of quality would reflect the self-image
 of the consumer - i.e.
 her expectations of a future improvement of the long-term standing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an important advantage in the empirical work with the differentiation
 of assets from quality in the above fashion - particularly so if one were
 to extend the notion of long-term utility to status-related consumption.
 While the literature on conspicuous consumption often relies on Veblen's
 futility assumption for conspicuous items - treating status goods as those
 that offer no true utility - our approach may allow all items to contribute
 to status by letting every purchase of any kind improve one's relative
 position in the society.
 A good would contribute to utility by offering i) an immediate benefit
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $(\eta)$
\end_inset

 ii) an expectation of self-improvement 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho)$
\end_inset

 and iii) a definite long-term improvement in wealth or security 
\begin_inset Formula $(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The researcher can associate certain items to the respective groups for
 each of these functions (
\begin_inset Formula $A,\eta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) while the model's representative consumers ought to either attain higher
 wealth (income) through long-term assets or increase the felicity and the
 expectation of stable high-income through higher non-durable consumption.
 In an equilibrium, the consumers would stay at a quality consumption level
 just equivalent to the perceived probability of promotion - as the deterministi
c part of their long-term utility is provided by owned transferable assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model above is indeed a simplistic one since it treats a population
 with more focus on quality as the one participating in more conspicuous
 consumption.
 However, we must emphasise that the above approach relies on the notions
 of quality, need and assets - ideas that vary across geographies and require
 some subjective judgment.
 It would be hardly appropriate - for example - to consider sundry electrical
 items as assets in a developed economy.
 The ability of a market to differentiate items within a commodity also
 influences a particular view of model's long-term utility (more quality
 is on offer in some markets than others).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a model for a risky long-term utility, we can now return to comparing
 the rural and the urban consumers.
 It is possible that the rural consumer not having the refrigerator believes
 that she isn't far away from having one by enhancing her social network
 and obtaining higher ranking within her own locality.
 Urban life does not need to imply a necessarily better life-style but it
 does provide an increased possibility of access to industrial goods - such
 as electrical items.
 Further, if the consumer is amongst the poor in a rural area (lower ranking
 due to assets) and consumes less quality, then she may have little to lose
 by moving to the urban area - where the assets may be lower, but the perceived
 probabilities of transition are higher due to higher population and increased
 qualities (availability of new assets).
 There is an upfront cost to pay - possibly with a loss of assets or quality
 in other areas - but it isn't reflected in the differences in cost of assets
 alone.
 Instead, an increased perceived probability (quality) also has a role to
 play in the long-term utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, if it is possible to model the acquisition of assets over
 time, an intertemporal setting could further enhance our understanding
 of how quality of expenditure changes over time - allowing us to provide
 more robust insights on how long-term utility inclusive of status is indicated
 through consumption - which we view as a combination of quality in commodities
 and acquisition of long-term assets.
 To motivate a discrete model for consumer choice, we now provide a multinomial
 logit analysis of quality against assets owned.

 less of the items with prices

 would be consumed).
 If the consumer doesn't decrease the quantities consumed

\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=p_{1}^{1}q_{1}^{1}+p_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}+p_{1}^{3}q_{1}^{3}$

\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=p_{2}^{1}q_{2}^{1}+p_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2}+p_{2}^{3}q_{2}^{3}$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{2}$

\begin_layout Standard
When additivity assumption cannot be used, two assumptions can simply the
 model - first that every commodity group is either i) one where LTDG dominate
 and quality variation does not exist or ii) LTDG don't exist and quality
 variation exists.
 With that assumption, consider that the commodity group 2 is comprised
 only of elementary goods with just one price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and a set of long-term durable goods whose price is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

>>
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 (LTDG) .
 In that case, the second-level of substitution would be applicable only
 for group 1 and the second-level of substitution would be driven only by
 the savings for the long-term durable good in the group 2 (with price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 Thus, certain commodity groups being dominated by LTDG and others by ENDC
 associate the first-level of substitution with the LTDG ownership in the
 model.
 An implicit assumption here is also that acquiring LTDG is always more
 expensive than engaging in ENDC - the quality differences within ENDC always
 matter more in short-term than the quality variation within LTDG.
 For example, if several types of cars exist in the transport commodity
 group as do the limousine companies for a taxi-commute, then without the
 implicit assumption one risks ignoring the quality variation in types of
 cars.
