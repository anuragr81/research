\begin_layout Title
Status consumption under severe inequalities 
\begin_inset Newline newline

- a case study in Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role played by wealth
 inequalities and spatial exclusion in status consumption is less understood
 due to the varied contexts of developing countries.
 We develop a model for status consumption considering permanent ownership
 and high quality the primary indicators of status in a framework of intertempor
al substitution.
 Incorporating the opposite effects of peer influences and poverty on status
 competitions in the model, we use the data on durable goods ownership from
 the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata to discuss how a segregation of
 overall quality in an environment of price heterogeneity may characterise
 status consumption in a developing economy.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Recent research on conspicuous consumption suggests its prevalence in both
 developed and developing economies

.
 The ubiquity of conspicuous consumption implies that consumers must maintain
 a consumption level relative to their reference group level regardless
 of how poor an economy is.
 But since reference groups themselves are subject to spatial and economic
 boundaries, the conspicuous consumption in an economy would also depend
 on the extent to which the social reference groups are segmented across
 the population.
 It is quite possible thus that the demand for certain conspicuous goods
 (not commodities) is completely absent in some reference groups that are
 excluded spatially or economically

 in conspicuous consumption - as the consumers need not emulate the rich
 if their social reference is insulated from the higher requirements of
 income corresponding to a group outside their own social reference.
 In other words, if the status competitions for a group do not include a
 significant number of consumers outside their own reference or peer group,
 the status consumption would be necessarily segmented across the groups
 formed on the basis of a particular social characteristic (e.g.
 class, region, race etc.).
 One may hardly claim therefore that the poor majority in a largely impoverished
 economy observes and emulates the lifestyles of a rich microscopic minority.
 The opposing effects of poverty levels and peer-influences on status consumptio
n have not been explored in much detail in the literature - except some
 related studies on the effects of income inequality on conspicuous consumption

 Germany after the economic liberalisation at the end of cold war to test
 if prolonged measures of suppressed incomes can influence visible consumption

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore status consumption in the context of wealth differences and social
 segmentation, we fall back to the notion of how status consumption is used
 to offset existing inequalities in income and economic standing.
 Instead of focusing on the disproportionate demand for signaling-goods
 (i.e.
 conspicuous consumption), therefore we adopt a model based on a social-deferenc
e view of status that has been embraced in many economic studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The model thus developed considers permanent ownership ( owned long-term
 goods ) and quality consumption as the key indicators of status that offset
 the existing income and social hierarchies.
 If the role of status consumption is to influence a ranking of income and/or
 wealth, it follows that two consumers with the same personal characteristics
 and the same set of needs can compete with each other for status only with
 quality in non-durable consumption and ownership of long-term durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We incorporate the effects of poverty and peer effects in the model where
 the consumer obtains utility through her social characteristics, quality
 in non-durable consumption and long-term durable goods.
 The consumption for quality and permanent ownership subject to the heterogenous
 prices are then explored across different age-groups, regions and levels
 of urbanisation in an economy.
 The model endogenises the role that personal characteristics (such as social
 class, level of education) play in status through the ownership of long-term
 durable goods and the constraints on quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While measuring permanent ownership is relatively easy in the empirical
 analyses when the assets owned by consumers are recorded in the consumption
 microdata, the measurements of quality using conventional methods from
 demand literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity,McKelveyQuality2011,McKenzie2005,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 turn out to be less attractive due to their reliance on observed market
 prices of items.
 A workaround is implicitly adopted by the visible consumption studies -
 which focus on items that are assumed to be futile for common use (an assumptio
n attributed to Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Without an assumption of futility of conspicuous items, the measurement
 of quality derived from an aggregation of items over commodities as separable
 groups

key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity,McKelveyQuality2011,McKenzie2005,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 would depend on the observed prices of items.
 While the futility assumption does ensure the separability of demand for
 visible goods, it does so at the cost of limiting oneself to a narrowed
 context of quality.
 We thus avoid making the futility assumption and use a more general notion
 of quality that permits any high-price non-durable consumption or a durable
 good to contribute to status - a notion which we feel is necessary to represent
 the conditions of a developing economy where basic needs are unmet for
 a significant portion of society.
 This notion of quality is measured as the 
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
 non-durable consumption given the cost of basic needs (both external and
 internal) - which are measured in data at a district-level granularity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the empirical analysis that follows, we use the context of the saving
 vs consumption under an observed heterogeneity of prices associated with
 permanent ownership and relative quality to understand the consumption

 Our quantitative model for the combined effect of wealth and consumption
 on one's status - which we use to describe the seemingly opposite effects
 of peer influences and poverty on status competitions - is aimed to be
 general enough to test the significance of status consumption across economies

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen has explored the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

 - but Veblen hardly dwells upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

 We argue that this recent attention to status consumption need not to be
 viewed asunder from the consumer demand literature on habit-formation (see

 for the classical treatment of quality and cost-of-living indices).
 Using the intertemporal framework with life-cycle assumptions, one could
 view status consumption as an inertia in moving away from a state of higher
 quality - a tendency that may in turn depend on the long-term characteristics
 such as social identity or education.
\end_layout

 The literature in marketing studies has similarly explored identity formation
 with acquired goods

.
 We suggest that a model that views consumption in the context of status
 as a ranking order based on income or wealth could be used to endogenise
 the role of social identity in conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of status most commonly used in literature - where it is seen
 merely as a long-term characteristics of the consumer - however is hardly
 one that relates consumption with social identity.
 The view of status as a static characteristic - which allows the studies
 in sociology and health sciences to use status as simply a vector education
 or income (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a few examples) - in fact poses a necessary paradox when used in the
 context of consumption.
 If status were only accumulated over a sufficiently long-term, how can
 there be any utility from status consumption? The paradox is resolved trivially
 if one considers that status is subject to change with consumption - just
 the way it is shaped by income or education.
 This dynamic view of status - as provided by Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - has been widely embraced in the economic studies.
 Here, status is viewed as an income-based ranking order that can be altered
 by the consumer with consumption.
 In other words, a consumer achieves status utility through status consumption
 by moving herself up in a ranking order that is otherwise determined by
 wealth and income.
 This is the view used in our intertemporal formulation of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we detail the relation of social characteristics with consumption,
 it is worth examining some fundamental questions the above view raises
 on whether the status-indicating goods in a developing country should be
 the same as those that are considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed economies or not.
 As the relative wealth differences are more relevant for status differences
 in the developing countries, the wealth differences could have far more
 weight for status than the limited range of visible items available to
 a consumer in the developing world (where industrial development is concentrate
d into fewer urban areas).
 We find that the presence of wealth differences in the developing countries
 is not always heeded its due attention in much of the literature on conspicuous
 consumption which we have surveyed (except for some studies directly exploring
 the effect income inequality on conspicuous consumption with exogenously
 observed poverty/income levels or GINI indices - see Jaikumar

 and Chai et al

key "ChaiKaus2019"

\end_inset

).
 In much of the literature, the inclusion of long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in status-related consumption has seemed arbitrary.
 Subjecting status to the intertemporal substitution and considering the
 explicit role of wealth differences on status - could guide the assessment
 of whether the particular long-term durable goods should be viewed as part
 of status consumption in an economy or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coming back to the issue of relating social identity with consumptin, it
 is possible to view the social identities too in the same ranking order
 as of wealth in a model where consumption beyond fulfillment of needs is
 seen as the consumer's attempt to alter the wealth hierarchy.
 However, since social identities (tribes, castes, race etc.) are limited
 to a particular social context, their inclusion in the wealth order poses
 another issue i.e.
 that the competitions to reach a higher status are necessarily segmented
 due to the scope of social identities.
 As a social identity that determines a reference group limits competitions
 for wealth within itself, one can no longer assume that lower economic
 classes would unconditionally emulate the habits of upper economic classes
 (i.e.
 pecuniary emulation as defined by Veblen - see Timothy

 and Chai

\end_inset

 for an empirical perspective on reference groups).
 This is because a social characteristic could carry some weight or utility
 for a consumer who compares herself to someone outside the limits of her
 social identity.
 It is only outside the reference group driven by one's identity that the
 social identity influences status the way wealth differences would.
 With the scope of the social identity which determines a reference group,
 the social identity doesn't carry much status to those in the reference
 group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since social identities are themselves often a result of long-term economic
 differences, the direction of wealth differences and social identities
 could be indistinguishable for empirical purposes.
 However, this may not always be the case in the economies undergoing fundamenta
l changes where older identities disappear and get replaced by newer ones.
 In a rapidly changing economy, that is, some social identities are likely
 to superseded by economic developments while others may get more crystallised
 - thus complicating the influence of identities on status.
 The combined effect of social identities and wealth differences on status
 is the quantitative concern that interests us in our model for status where
 it is indicated with consumption quality and permanent ownership.
 Before we describe the measurement of the two and explain the model in
 more detail, it is worth reiterating that despite the rapid economic developmen
ts and creation of new markets for status - which often serve as a backdrop
 for visible consumption - it is possible that due to structural inequalities
 in the developing world, the socio-economic inequalities have far more
 weight in certain contexts for status than the consumption of a few conspicuous
 items that are considered visible in the developed economies (see Ustuner-Holt

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 (which is how a researcher may obtain the list of visible items) is adjusted
 to include items that may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recap, if status is viewed as a ranking order based on long-term characterist
ics such as income, education and other social characteristics, the consumers
 can be assumed to compete with each other in order to offset the deep wealth
 and social hierarchies that determine the ranking order (see Corneo 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In an empirical analysis, there are two status indicator variables whose
 measurement is critical to the model's operationalisation.
 First, is the wealth of a consumer which we could proxy relatively easily
 in a developing economy if the stock of durable goods the consumer has
 (inclusive of housing, land and other long-term assets) is made available.
 Second, is the quality in non-durable consumption.
 We consider the contribution of quality to status simply because the fulfillmen
t of basic needs alone is not expected to offer any advantage in a status
 competition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, a consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 Therefore as long as a common set of consumer needs - which are fundamentally
 the same by definition - can be measured in a population being observed,
 there is no status utility to be achieved through addressing of needs alone.
 The claim has a particular implication for our model of utility - if there
 is any status related utility to be derived from non-durable consumption,
 it would be constituted in the felicity from 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
quality (which is defined as distance from needs which themselves are observed
 within a particular reference group).
 It also follows that any status that is not signaled with quality in non-durabl
e consumption and is not associated with the innate social characteristics
 of the consumer, it must come out of the possession of (and thus utility
 from) the long-term durable goods (i.e.
 the proxy of wealth).
 This can also incorporate the life-cycle assumptions if a durable good
 is seen as one that can be passed on to the progeny.
 Stated differently, the long-term goods encompass the long-term demands
 of the consumer while her short-term concerns (which could themselves be
 influenced by the acquired wealth) comprise only of needs and quality (inclusiv
e of short-term durable items - if any).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A robust empirical measure of quality has been subject to much debate in
 the literature owing primarily to the lack of sufficiently detailed consumption
 surveys.
 Most consumption surveys hardly record the market-observed prices or the
 quantities of the items consumed - let alone the brand-related details
 of the items.
 This makes the identification of higher quality somewhat non-trivial.
 The market-prices of items purchases or even quantities consumed - which
 could permit us to view quality as the proportion of expensive items standardis
ed by quantity (see Nelson

) - are seldom recorded in the consumption surveys.
 In the instances where they are recorded, they tend to be limited to the
 food items alone.
 In the absence of quantities consumed and the detailed prices of key diary
 items, we use the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quality by consider a higher-than-required consumption based on a minimum
 necessary consumption (this is similar to the problem of cost-of-living
 indices in the literature - see Fisher 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "false"

\end_inset

for the classical approach to the problem).
 Thus we observe how the cost of a standard basket of basic needs varies
 across the regions and districts in the economy and infer the varying cost
 of needs as the basis of our measure for quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as the basic needs of the consumer in an economy can be determined,

In the attempt to define consumer needs, on one hand, we have the view that
 needs are determined solely by subjective preferences (see Townsend

 her subjective interests (wants).
 To fix a particular definition of needs for own empirical analyses, we
 lean towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need
 of the consumer without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts should be standardised.
 The basic needs of the consumer are thus the standard requirements not
 meeting which would lead to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the
 theory argued for by Doyal and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite.
 A starch diet fulfilling the set of dietary needs can thus be ruled out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ideas of health and autonomy may appear slightly abstract at first but
 they are quite easy to interpret in a particular cultural setting as the
 internal and external needs of the consumer.
 To infer the reference level of the basic internal needs of the consumer,
 one could focus on the biological needs (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - representing number of household-members, number of children, individual
 age, body weight etc.).
 As we rely on the total of cost of needs for our notion of quality - given
 the lack of consumed quantities in the diary - observing the price of needs
 becomes necessary for our measurement of quality.
 This also means that the social or spatial context of the consumer has
 an indirect effect on the total cost of basic internal needs of a consumer
 (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the demographic vector inclusive of spatial identity and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 represent a measure of needs) and therefore the quality availed by the
 consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external needs of the consumer are clearly not encompassed by the biological
 needs alone.
 This is where a particular social context becomes directly relevant.
 Consider for example the question of whether lodging/home-ownership or
 the primary education of children in the area where a consumer resides
 should be considered a basic need or not.
 Such needs are determined by a social reference point rather than biology.
 The issue with using the biological needs alone as the reference is that
 such an approach would completely ignore the the peer effects that have
 a role in consumer choice.
 For the purposes of measuring conspicuous consumption, the utility a consumer
 avails from the relative quality depends on her perception of what she
 considers necessary (which comprise of the external needs which may encompassin
g a lot more than health and autonomy) rather what is dictated by biology
 alone.
 Thus the cost of relative quality which the consumer derives utility from
 - implicitly considers what is perceived to be higher quality in the consumer's
 own social reference group.
 The inclusion of peer effects - i.e.
 external needs - is necessary in the measure for quality as the reference
 consumption level of the consumer's social context.

 An interpretation of quality must therefore also rely on the distance of
 a consumer's non-durable consumption relative to the reference group's
 consumption level (i.e.
 the consumption in the immediate surroundings e.g.
 a locality, a relevant social group, income or owner group of the durable
 goods etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the model we have outlined so far, a consumer can avail consumption
 utility only from durable and non-durable goods.
 Needs must therefore also depend on the wealth of the consumer or her demograph
ic characteristics.
 This makes sense in the empirical terms as well - since consumer must pay
 maintenance and upkeep costs for the long-term durable goods she inherits
 or purchases.
 Such costs directly contribute to the non-durable consumption and increase
 the reference level of the consumer needs.
 The cost of needs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 could thus be better written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho,A)$
\end_inset

 - considering the prices of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 for a consumer with a demographic vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and the long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which would bear some costs of maintenance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By owning long-term durable goods, the consumer essentially improves her
 social-reference and aims to get ahead of others by maximising her stock
 of durable goods relative to the reference possession level (let's say
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the reference ownership level).
 The consumer's long-term possessions can also be viewed as a commitment
 that lead to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho,A)$
\end_inset

.
 The cost of needs provided by such a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and the expenditure on the relative quality availed by the consumer would
 thus constitute the total expenditure on non-durable consumption by the
 consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 More particularly, if the cost for quality level 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in non-durable consumption is observed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(\psi,\nu)$
\end_inset

 for needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, then the total non-durable consumption for the consumer can be written
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\kappa(\psi,\nu)+\Psi(\rho,A,\psi)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that status is not considered an internal need using our approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the level
 of durable goods ownership she achieves while her internal needs remain
  independent of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both expensive
 durable goods and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class internal needs
 of the consumer).
 Thus at a normative level, the difference between the status of a rich
 and that of a poor family is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 both the families combined with a disparate demand for quality of education
 (driven partly by a disparate price for higher quality).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In a simple instance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

, it could simply be assumed to be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(\psi,\nu)=\psi\nu$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To motivate a utility function from the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,\nu,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 so far, notice that while the consumer does avail utility within her own
 social reference (specified by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

), a utility function should represent the case where all consumers are
 permitted to rank (compare) each other.
 This is a necessary condition for us to define a common utility function
 applicable to all consumers.
 Since status differences do exist across social reference groups as well
 (e.g.
 individuals in one region compare themselves to those from other regions),
 it follows that a consumer must get some utility from the identity of one's
 social reference in order for there to be a higher (lower) status utility
 obtained with a richer (poorer) identity (e.g.
 region, class etc.).
 If this weren't true - i.e.
 if the consumers could get utility inclusive-of-status only from their
 durable goods value and non-durable consumption - then there could be no
 point of indifference at which a consumer in the poor neighborhood could
 trade places with another in a richer neighborhood.
 For status consumption to have some utility to the consumer, the utility
 function - which is the same for all consumers - must also depend on group
 identity in some way so that a rich consumer with low-positioning can be
 convinced to trade places with someone in the poor neighborhood who has
 a higher (local) social-positioning.
 A common utility function for all consumers and the presence of status-related
 consumption - together permit the small fish in a big pond - so to speak
 - to trade places with a big fish in a small pond.
 Both the i) utility from identity to a reference group and ii) the social
 positioning within a reference group are thus key to the model for status
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider an example to illustrate how two consumers may compete for
 a utility inclusive of status.
 Let there be consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 who live in a poor region (small pond) and a rich region (big pond) respectivel
y so that their non-durable consumption levels are 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{P},c_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The average consumption levels in the regions they reside are 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Let's also assume that the values of their respective long-term durable
 goods bear the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}<A_{R}$
\end_inset

 .
 The same is true for the average asset ownership of the regions 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 ,
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 <
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 If we now consider the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P}<\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 then the cost above needs as quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=\frac{c_{P}-\Psi_{P}}{\psi_{P}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{R}=\frac{c_{R}-\Psi_{R}}{\psi_{R}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the same needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{P}=\psi_{R}$
\end_inset

, if i) the status utility were to be achieved only through durable goods
 and quality ii) the needs cost the same for both the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and if iii) the utility were a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

, then there may never be any two values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{P},A_{P})\sim(\nu_{R},A_{R})$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 could trade places (ponds) with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 The dependence of utility function on being 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 or being 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 - through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\rho,A,\psi)$
\end_inset

 or directly with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - is necessary for this indifference to exist.
 Such a utility allows 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 to increase her non-durable quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}$
\end_inset

 so that she is indifferent to moving to an urban area even for a higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}$
\end_inset

.

Assuming that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular sense
 - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for visible consumption
 can be considered separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 We do not find futility assumption plausible for the data we observe in
 the developing countries.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For the empirical analyses, probably the most desirable feature of visiblity
 based models is the separability of necessary items from conspicuous items
 - a property that is offered by assuming that the conspicuous items are
 futile (an argument attributed to Veblen).
 To accommodate this assertion, the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 often includes items that are just commonly understood to have some signaling
 value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In nascent modern economies of sub-Saharan Africa, however, we find that
 the bandwagon items such as electronics or cars pose obvious empirical
 concerns as they are hardly futile but also serve status needs due to the
 rapid and recent urbanisation.
 The futility assumption is therefore hardly suitable for a model that is
 cognisant of wealth differences in a rapidly developing economy.
 We therefore use a slightly different approach to status consumption that
 is based on the role that long-term durable goods may play towards status

 While these could be related to snob and bandwagon behaviours (see Corneo

Hierarchy of Consumer Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The claim that much of our model rests upon is that status is a part of
 the consumer's long-term utility.
 If that weren't the case, the representative consumer in the model would
 have no reason to engage in status-related consumption in any form.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a
 consumer can achieve a higher status in the model by the acquisition of
 durable goods (which is assisted with higher income) as well as by the
 status promotion through high-quality non-durable consumption (which may
 enhance social interactions, improve the consumer's self-image and is possible
 to achieve with lower income).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have discussed before, the role of non-durable consumption is two-fold
 in the model - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer
 and second, it achieves high-quality consumption with status-related goals.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity and
 status advantage - since all else being the same, someone consuming a higher
 quality is likely to have more status than someone consuming a lower quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The utility from status consumption is a combination of short-term and long-term
 goals of the consumer.
 The short-term goals are fulfilled with non-durable consumption and the
 long-term goals through ownership of durable goods or assets of high value.
 The social characteristics such as residence, neighborhood or social class
 could be viewed as cumulative status items that are acquired over multiple
 generations.
 As long as one may assume that the rewards of status are passed on to the
 progeny, this view of social characteristics allows us to view status competiti
ons - which develop within a particular social reference group - in the
 utility model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this temporal hierarchy of goods, some items that bring status are more
 temporary than others.
 Social identity is probably the most permanent of all possessions, while
 ownership of durable goods is more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 In an intertemporal substitution framework, the representative consumer,
 once having addressed her basic needs, would therefore attempt to distribute
 her total (income) outlay into the three variables - needs, quality and
 permanent ownership.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 does not change in her lifetime, a consumer may only be influenced by the
 characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (and not exercise her choice over it).
 This would mean that all the consumers sharing the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would compete for status with both the durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Empirically, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is simply the total cost of durable goods owned by a consumer (or a household).
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase durable goods and the actual
 purchase of durable goods.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
 All the long-term durable goods in the economy are as if they were managed
 by a large firm (owing its success to preferences being the same for everybody)
 providing furniture, housing and all amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every durable goods and service - offered as a life-long subscription -
 could be purchased by paying an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 to this company.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and quality in non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 It follows that when consumers with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 compete with each other for status, their respective 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 also contributes to the utility.
 As social characteristics themselves may only have an epistemological value,
 we assume that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for consumers carries a direct utility proportional proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the overall possession of the social group with the characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 A higher value of

 Since

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 seen as facing a new set of needs based on her new environment (and is
 not expected to carry over her habits in from the past environment).
 Therefore the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 in non-durable consumption is obtained through a measure of group behaviour
 associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 The intertemporal substitution between durable goods

 The choice amongst

 Similarly, the consumers with the same level of

A feature of the consumer choice with variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A,\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 that is ostensibly unrelated with the above outlined temporal hierarchy
 is the set of constraints that are imposed by the longer-term choices on
 the available short-term options.
 The longer-term choices are more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

permanent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that they 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

protect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one's status - as they introduce more possibilities of status-signalling
 through through somewhat less permanent (non-durable) means.
 A particular state or characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 of the consumer could constraint or enhance the available choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, much the way 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may constrain 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 For example, having an urban residence opens up the access to a wider market
 for status goods.
 In household-related consumption, similarly, the high prices of housing
 may encourage a consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus
 increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 However, she may improve the overall quality instead of buying a bigger
 house only until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 This implies that the consumers with lower weight for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 may compensate by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 but only as much.
 The effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is not only a matter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

herd-effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but is often a direct result of the costs imposed by the durable goods
 one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.).
 These constraints are treated in the model as part of the needs cost function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 - which includes both the effects peer-influences 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and possession of long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (see discussion in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For example, the role of unavailability of certain goods in a particular
 region (e.g.
 electricity - particularly relevant in the context of developing countries)
 would be represented simply with a suppressed costs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason why such constraints on choices are not entirely unrelated to
 the temporal hierarchy we have specified is that the constraints are essentiall
y the part of commitment implied by the consumer's long-term choice.
 Certain costs are necessarily associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - both of which (along with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 if a consumer could change her characteristics) are long-term commitments
 of the consumer.
 If a consumer chooses to be on a trajectory of higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

, the consumer might have less concerns for status ( a choice where life-cycle
 effects have a direct influence).
 Similarly, the ownership of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 also presents a commitment to costs associated with the owned durable good
 - albeit less inescapable than 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - since 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be sold in the market or rented out for income.
 The constraints which choices present are thus also part of the temporal
 hierarchy we have outlined in the previous section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving further into the dynamics of the model, we assume that at the end
 of the lifetime of a consumer, the personal wealth of the consumer would
 either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so that the asset
 account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth of some other
 household(s) in the economy.
 Consequently, all consumers in the population differ in the the starting
 amount of their asset accounts as well as the trends of their salaries.
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and her salary after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau-\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

 years of working is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 then at a given age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (the start of working age is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

), she could have purchased some long-term durable-goods from a portion
 of her income - deciding that she does not want more durable goods for
 the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, she could have experienced a change in the life-circumstances
 (needing a bigger or a more expensive house) thus needing more durable
 goods urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Due to minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing countries,
 we assume an environment of negligible credit.
 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only durable goods available in the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider how two consumers that are vastly separated by their
 respective characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1},\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho_{1}}A<\int_{\rho_{2}}A$
\end_inset

 or vice versa) might behave in the model.
 Recall that the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\rho})$
\end_inset

 means that someone with a group that has a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 an urbanite or someone in a privileged social class) would be believed
 to be rich - even though her real wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 might be at same level with someone with a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 a rural person or someone with an underprivileged social class).
 What permits the decomposition of utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into those through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the social observation (i.e.
 perception) of individuals in terms of identities that are established
 through long-term political or economic events.
 Thus an urbanite or someone with a privileged social class might not need
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth to indicate a higher status when compared with a rural person or
 someone from an under-privileged class who may have the same or even higher
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth.
 Yet since competitions for status matter within one's own social reference
 group and since inference of status is through social observation (perception),
 the individuals from respective social classes would continue to compare
 themselves within the same social reference group as well as those outside
 their social reference group - implying the relevance of both 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 in the common utility function
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While we assume static 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the empirical analyses, the separate effects also accommodate the change
 in demand of quality as one changes their social reference group (e.g.
 by moving residence or establishing social networks outsides one's reference
 group).
 In such a case, the consumer changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has to to adjust to the higher (or lower) 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (due to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\rho)$
\end_inset

).

 The separate effects of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 also explain how the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 could dominate to such an extent that competing with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

 might not matter towards status competitions.

This is not far-fetched in a developing economy.
 However, outside the developing economy contexts, if needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 (e.g.
 expansion of family) were to be treated as part of the consumer choice,
 we may consider that an individual could delay or suspend the expansion
 of family in order to fulfill a target 
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 The basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 the two may face depends both on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 When faced with imminent expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 so as to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A)$

 This effect is indeed ignored with the assumption of a predetermined

\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$

 distributing income between

In a typical solution of the intertemporal problem, the wealth constraint

\end_inset

 (i.e.
 all of the consumer's durable goods being liquidated and consumed in the
 last period) and the discounting rate based on

 at every period i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}

 is the price of durable-goods in period 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu,i}$

 represents the price non-durable quality respectively (not associated with
 a particular item with quality overall).
 The above means that the consumer may consume quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}=A_{1}+P_{A,2}\Delta_{2}$

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu_{t}\psi_{t}+\Psi_{t}(\psi_{t},A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 she can spend all of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu,t}$

 additive over time i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=u_{1}+u_{2}$

\begin_layout Standard
As we assume that the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t},A_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $J_{t}=x_{t}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{t},A_{t})$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 To motivate the dynamic programming approach to this solution, consider
 first what consumer's choices would be in a one-period consumption.
 Here, she could either spend her outlay as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{_{1}}=\nu_{1}\psi_{1}+\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or keep the minimum consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0,c_{1}=\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

) in the period and end up with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, then the first-order conditions would provide us the optimal condition
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Let this utility be 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*},A_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 To extend this to two periods with dynamic optimisation one can exploit
 the fact that a consumer independently optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 would always obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are unbounded functions 
\begin_inset Formula $max(u_{1}+u_{2})\le max(u_{1})+max(u_{2})=u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is only a tool to formulate the dynamic optimisation approach - using which
 the value of utility is to be optimised over her life period in a 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

-period model (
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 being the age of the consumer).
 Thus in the optimisation of utility function in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the consumer must optimise both 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 in periods 1 and 2 respectively.

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have put no restrictions on

\begin_inset Formula $k_{A,1},k_{A,2})$
\end_inset

 (other than that they should add to unity in every period).
 The likely next step would be add some structure to the consumer choice
 by introducing life-cycle effects with a form of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu},k_{A}$
\end_inset

 that depends on the age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of the consumer - the rationale being simply that the same level of quality
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 would offer less utility to the consumer as shes age (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 declines with age) or that the same level of long-term durable goods has
 higher utility later in life (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A}$
\end_inset

 increases with age).
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu},k_{A}$
\end_inset

 could be assumed to have a form 
\begin_inset Formula $n(\tau)$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau)$
\end_inset

 - functions known to the consumer that vary with the age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of the consumer.
 In economies that are segregated based on long-term durable goods that
 are largely intergenerational (and thus long-term enough for their utility
 to not change over time), the sensitivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau,A)$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 may be very little and could allow us to use a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau)$

The above solution highlights some remarkable features of how a substitution
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may be influenced by social charactersitics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and life-cycle effects.
 An obvious implication is that higher needs suppress the total outlay for
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Also evident is that in absolute terms, the richer consumers would find
 it more expensive to indicate wealth to their surrounding (it's cheaper
 for a poor person to get richer).
 The equivalent argument applies for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A,t}$
\end_inset

 increases with time (due to the form that we've assumed), the consumer
 would increase her ownership of durable goods accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the above model does explain the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t},A_{t}$
\end_inset

 with stated assumptions, there are reasons to doubt both the utility of
 a loglinear formulation for empirical analyses and the validity of the
 forms 
\begin_inset Formula $n(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 As we show with the help of a cost-function formulation, the loglinear
 utility does limit how status utility could relate to price of quality
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 - the variation of which with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 provides a particular context to status consumption that we wish to explore
 in the study.
 While the direct utility model is useful to explain the model dynamics,
 a cost-function formulation provides a more general framework for the econometr
ic analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before revisiting the substitution with a cost-function approach, let us
 first look at the limitation posed by the log-linear utility in more detail.
 For a general 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\beta_{i}log(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, if the budget constraint is set to be 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}$
\end_inset

, then the optimisation using a Lagrangian leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $L=u-\lambda(\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}-x)$
\end_inset

.
 The first-order conditions imply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
x=\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}\\
\frac{\beta_{i}}{q_{i}-\gamma_{i}}=\lambda p_{i}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})=1$
\end_inset

The cost-function formulation shows just how restrictive a loglinear direct
 utility function really is.
 The above direct utility form of the loglinear utility claims that the
 price derivatives of cost-functions (which are typically equated with the
 budget ratio in the econometric analysis i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial p_{i}}$
\end_inset

) are the same for both subsistence and bliss sub-utilities.
 This is a strong assumption if one were to consider status utility using
 the loglinear formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus for the consumer choice between consuming value 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 (which the consumer avails in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) and increasing asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, a general PIGLOG cost-function would allow the sensitivity of savings
 rate (choice between consuming in the current period vs saving for future)
 with respect to prices of quality and durable goods to be different at
 subsistence and bliss levels.
 The cost-function can still be used to describe the dynamics of the model
 just equally well.
 Much the way a direct utility function under a budget constraint explains
 that a higher price makes it difficult to obtain the same utility (comprising
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{q}=\{q_{i}\}$
\end_inset

), the cost-function approach shows how a higher price causes a consumer
 to avail less utility for the same cost (
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary reason we adopt the cost-function approach is that it readily
 extends itself to the case when consumers face different prices based on
 their 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

Another option - which we find less realistic - is to let the price derivatives
 depend directly on 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (instead of on the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{p}$
\end_inset

 alone).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 More specifically, if we can assume that participants compete in a market
 for status with quality and permanent ownership with varied respective
 prices, the PIGLOG formulation could be used to better quantify how the
 variation in prices of subsistence and bliss influences the consumption
 choices for the consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cost function and heterogeneity of prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In term of the cost-function, a heterogeneity in price of commodities means
 that the utility units purchased per unit of money (at subsistence or bliss
 levels) would depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Such a heterogeneity in prices can exist for both quality and permanent
 ownership and is likely to be severe in the developing economies where
 structural issues - such as high transportation costs, under-developed
 markets or lack of centralised incentives - are commonplace.
 Such dependence of price on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 may be driven both by income inequalities and herding effects.
 If we long-term durable consumption inclusive of assets such as land, then
 the poor not only have an insufficient income to increase their utility,
 they also face the conditions of low intergenerational mobility (i.e.
 the opportunities for higher future wealth are generally limited to those
 who are already somewhat wealthy) - thus flocking in areas where bliss
 (inclusive of that from assets) is lower (overall) compared to where the
 rich tend to live.
 The heterogeneity in prices of durable goods is therefore also an effect
 of such structural conditions that develop over a long time (often longer
 than the lifetime of the consumer)

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The more unequal an economy is - one may say - the more limited would be
 the high-end durable goods to the very few in an economy - therefore implying
 higher costs for certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 either as 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three issues relevant to the econometric appraoches to the cost-functi
on formulation.
 First is that in the context of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well as non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

, the prices in the above formulation are those of commodities and not items.
 Thus even though the purchase prices (directly observed, recorded or recalled
 in the survey) for individual items are unavailable in a survey, the empirical
 analyses could proceed as long as one may reliably approximate the price
 of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Items not being accessible to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 not being available in a certain region) do not make the quality lower
 or higher - as quality measurement is tied to the needs level associated
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (which would not include the unavailable item).
 Similarly, since assets are long-term durable goods - we assume that they
 are priced fairly over time and have no variations in quality.
 Given the long-term commitment in the purchase of long-term assets as well
 as the sense of quality we have defined, it is difficult to imaging the
 excess land acquired by as consumer.
 As a consequence of the temporal hierarchy (see previous discussion) ,
 we can assume that price of assets do not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the way 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 does.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the life-cycle effects are already part of the model as the effective
 price of quality increases with increase in needs (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\psi$
\end_inset

).
 Lastly, bliss and subsistence in the PIGLOG formulation merely represent
 high and low levels of utility rather than the psychological state (goals)
 of the consumers that they wish to achieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coming back to the heterogeneity of prices in the PIGLOG formulation (Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PIGLOG"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the relevance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (which determines price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 ) in subsistence costs 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p(\rho)$
\end_inset

 and bliss costs 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p(\rho))$
\end_inset

 - could imply either a higher bliss or an exclusion from higher bliss.
 The contribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 thus depends on the position of the consumer in the rank (of income, wealth).
 In the direct utility model, we have explained this by letting 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 drive not just 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 but also the near-permanent bliss through 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we ignore the quality variation in durable goods, the idea of position
 in ranking order is interpreted as the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 on quality through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\rho)$
\end_inset

 in the cost-function approach
\bar under
.
 Heterogeneity of prices - therefore - is not just about having lower prices
 in the poorer region but the differences in prevailing quality - arising
 due to local conditions and long-term assets.
 
\bar default
the bliss would therefore depend through quality through 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also delineates for peer effects cause a given 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

 to contribute to a higher or lower bliss than from another characteristic
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Even though the rich live in a better neighborhood and indicate higher
 status as a group - someone not so rich amongst the rich might get more
 bliss by staying in a poorer neighborhood if she prefers to have a higher
 relative income with respect to her reference group.
 A poorer reference groups lowers 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and contributes to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 - which by definition is relative quality.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is lower in a poorer reference group and corresponds to lower 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (either subsistence or bliss).
 The rich or poor neighborhood residence as a characteristic therefore causes
 higher or lower bliss relative to one's own.
 In PIGLOG formulation since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 affects 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, someone with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 would have a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

, a consumer substitutes between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and the tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,A$

 A not-so rich consumer in a rich neighborhood could lower her 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (or trade places with) as she moves to a lower-ranking 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - a consumer who is surrounded by the relatively poorer consumer is likely
 to obtain the same utility as someone who is richer in absolute terms but
 poorer relative to her surroundings.

 in the direct utility approach it depends on how much the

 we consider the subsistence level the price of minimum basket.
 We elaborate this with comparing the heterogeneity in the cost-functions
 (i.e.

\begin_inset Formula $b(p,\rho)$

Substantiating the above argument, our loss aversion means that we wish

 not accept a

 We're more sanguine about (and may only secretly wish for) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 improving bliss.
 This is the asymmetry that should be evident from data.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 having no influence on subsistence would encourage status consumption.
 Segregation is related to reference point - so somebody having a 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that indicates poverty and is poor as well - would not want to have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 that matches the rich - 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for that person is actually low - simply because it's guranteed to have
 a lower utility compared to the rich guy.
 Segregation is only in the sense that there is no participation with the
 segregated in the economy.
 Only tectonic shifts can change that.
 This may change urban populations where subsistence is probably met - segregati
on however is still there - as it is driven by wealth - quality is differentiate
d primarily with long-term goods.
 However, quality is

 This is particularly attractive if you're Black.
 In the South, you're probably a slave and spat at everywhere you go - you're

 costs are high (or income is persistently less than subsistence - forced
 to be so because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 is high - all economic opportunities have been set up so that you don't
 rise - hence the denial of services).

 richest places you have dignity as a black man and definitely a good level

 Such conditions of a narrow difference between

 At higher income level

 Therefore those who have lower costs of subsistence (
\begin_inset Formula $a(p,\rho_{L})<a(p,\rho_{i})|\rho_{i}\ne\rho_{L}$

) may participate in status consumption with those with higher needs but
 only to a certain extent - after which only the higher income 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$

 could improve bliss.
 The difference in subsistence levels - represents the limits imposed by
 lower asset possession (and lower needs).
 One could improve quality and durable goods but the effect of

 It is worth asking why exactly do subsistence costs differ in first place

 If needs are not being met and humans are inclined to make their ends meet

 Status competition does exist in this case but not a significant one as

 Since consumer facing higher bliss costs lose little by potentially changeing

We can summarise the above discussion in two claims that follow from the

 These motivate our discussion for the econometric analyses of data in the

Claim 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Claim 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status competitions are spurred as bliss becomes expensive and subsistence
 becomes cheaper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish the first claim, we only need to see that in an economy where
 subsistence is sensitive to a certain demographic characteristic (class,
 race, region, educational attainment etc.), the role of the demographic
 vector becomes too important

 The only way for an individual to change one's fortunes may be to change
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 by moving residence or getting an education).
 The status from consumption itself could hardly achieve much when two 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 values were segregated as if there were two different economies separated
 by the particular value(s) of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 drives bliss but not subsistence (
\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$
\end_inset

 doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 does), then changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 might have the same effect as increasing the total outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the contribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to utility could be substituted with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 A perfect segregation based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 could also result when the same value of demographic vector is significant
 for both bliss and subsistence.
 Indeed not having any demographic characteristic relevant to either bliss
 or subsistence means a rather equal society where status differences may
 not have much value.
 It is only when bliss is sensitive to a demographic vector while subsistence
 isn't that status competitions can be participated in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second claim is easily verified with the observation that the needs
 for status are always secondary to basic needs.
 In an economy where subsistence is more expensive but bliss isn't, the
 competition for basic needs may be too crowded or the general perception
 of what is basic may be too high (in terms of cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

).
 Thus status competitions are discouraged when everyone struggles to keep
 up the minimum-costs necessary in the economy.

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The formulation thus allows one to test how the particular demographic
 characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 - in addition to the life-cycle effects- also influence whether consumers
 care more about 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 that

Cost of Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input for the cost of needs is the diary of food items and the recall
 diary for upto one year.
 The consumption of the items that are considered necessities is calculated
 for the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 The cost of needs thus calculated in this manner (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) depend on the particular locality where the household is located.
 Given the categories of consumption in Tanzania i.e.
 food, household, energy and transport, we calculate the cost of basic needs
 as the cost of minimal requirements in every category.
 As an example, we use the commodity sub-groups of carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables in the food category.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - which is composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - are then calculated in each region and district based
 on the prices of the items recorded in the survey (which records the prices
 at the district level as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket could be a
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - as these are most often
 the cheapest items in their respective sub-group (
\begin_inset Formula ${carb,fact,protein,fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the cost of this basket thus calculated is much higher
 in the urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 The cost thus calculated is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the food component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al

For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 The costs of clothing in the region for a particular year are included

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The running costs of the house - depending on whether it's owned or rented
 are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 When the house is rented, the running costs are simply the reported rent
 on the house whereas when the house is owned by the household, a 2.5% of
 the cost of the house is used (the maintenance rate is estimated based
 on the expenditure reported in the survey for the houses that report maintenanc
e on the owned house) .
 The matching of need with the level of durable goods owned is similar to
 how the energy costs are set up based on the type of durable good one possesses.

 In terms of the model, the user of electricity may indicate a higher status

[CALCULATING QUALITY] The non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$

 is seen as the sum of the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$

 and the excess consumption is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which acts as the quality control in the model.
 The quality chosen by the consumer is thus the needs-adusted difference
 between her reported non-durable consumption and the cost of needs (evaluated
 locally at the district level in the data)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that relying only on the total costs associated with a commodity
 (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality or 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
cannot differentiate between the consumption of a higher quantity and of
 a higher quality.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 for a commodity priced 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$
\end_inset

, then our quality metric for the consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

).
 That said, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity
 are available in the region or not, it is possible to draw conclusions
 about over-consumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity (more so when a pseudo-panel analysis
 is used).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The reference point of needs is crucial to our notion of quality as it
 is simply a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 For food commodities, standardising a set of needs general across the populatio
n is relatively easy - as the cost of needs in food would simply be the
 cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs, fruits etc.

 items as basic needs.
 Considering the commodities food, energy, transport and household
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A different set of categories could be chosen for another consumption dataset.

Recall that the costs incurred due to maintenance, usage and upkeep of the
 long-term durable goods is also included in the reference level non-durable
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$

 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and would thus bear a higher non-durable
 consumption level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

(while the consumer that does not own any electrical goods would not have
 the same non-durable consumption).
 To illustrate this further, consider a consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 with a refrigerator and another consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 without a refrigerator who both have the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and the same set of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 .
 Let's 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 in this particular example.
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{R'}<\Psi_{R}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{R'}>c_{t}-\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

) .
 But does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 Not only is it that the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity groups
 (over energy or durable goods for example).
 In fact, there is little sense in claiming that the quality in one commodity
 can be substituted with quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality is meaningful only with the consideration of
 a total cost of basic needs level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The notion of excess - subject to such a level - is thus the only a way
 to assess overall quality in non-durable consumption.
 Thus if having a refrigerator is not considered a need, then we may say
 nothing more than that 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

.
 By avoiding counting maintenance costs in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, we merely maintain the same interpretation
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is possible that ownership of some durable goods generates some rental
 income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, such income would be considered an additional stream of income instead

The inclusion of estimated maintenance costs raises some concerns about
 measurement errors in quality.
 For example, if 
\bar default
our estimate about usage of refrigerator is inaccurate by a certain amount,
 the error would be percolate in the measurement of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}=\frac{c_{t}-\Psi_{t}}{\psi_{t}}$
\end_inset

.
 The tighter is the association of a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 to a user, higher would be such an error.
 The unique determination of the measure of quality for every consumer -
 depends on the accuracy of the needs of the consumer at an individual level.
 This is rather infeasible in the empirical analysis - because the data
 which the needs are understood from are hardly applicable at an individual
 level - just because someone didn't report clothing or transportation costs
 in the recorded week - doesn't mean that they don't have clothing needs.
 The cost of needs is essentially an aggregate-concern - more so when we
 have tied them with the peer effects by attempting to consider cost associated
 with owned durable goods.
 Empirically, therefore it may be futile to measure the needs of the consumer
 at an individual level and therefore it is futile also to think of quality
 consumed at an individual level.
 An appropriate aggregation - possibly a pseudo-panel approach is the preferred
 approach.

Another issue is that we look at the new purchases of durable goods but

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The implicit assumption is that representative consumer has acquired the
 habit of having higher quality.
 If we were wrong by a certain amount for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\rho)$
\end_inset

 due to wrong-usage assumptions of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-associations, then the our ideas about quality would be wrong.
 Time-demeaning may be one way to approach this in a regression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that caveat, the empirical method for adjusting necessities based on
 the durable goods one possesses is straightforward if we assume a typical
 usage for all expensive durable goods owned.
 If a household possesses a car, then the needs of the household would be
 incremented with the petrol consumption per year and maintenance for a
 typical usage.
 This also means that some costs of needs (e.g.
 for food) are multiplied by the number of household members in the family
 while other needs aren't - as we obtain the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for a particular household (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Needs-Cost"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classification of long-term durable goods is based on intergenerational
 transfers i.e.
 an item is included in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and thus its cost of maintenance are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) only if it can be passed on through generations.
 The durable goods that cannot be passed through generations are not considered
 long-term and excluded from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (this is due to the life-cycle considerations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since social characteristics are acquired over a life-time and often require
 some investment (e.g.
 education fees or club-membership fees), one could - from a rather theoretical
 standpoint - treat such social characteristics too as durable-good.
 Although we do treat education as a personal characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in our analyses, the case could be made for education to be treated as
 a long-term durable good as well (which is valid for an inter-generational
 transfer, requires a long investment over time and has a certain value
 in the employment market).
 While such a consideration is not prevented in the model for consumer choice,
 we do impose the condition that for a long-term choice (such as committing
 to the education of one's progeny) to be considered part of the durable
 goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the costs of maintenance (e.g.
 school fees) associated with the durable-goods should be included in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 If not, then such a long-term choice - improves one's relative positioning
 directly and must be considered as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (moving residence or entering a new social network are such examples).
 In other words, education could be treated as a durable good in the regular
 sense only as long as an educated individual is required to pay definite
 maintenance costs for having been educated.

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_inset

Durable goods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey includes everything from
 a mobile phone to land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 The details of records include the number of durable goods owned by the
 household, the reported cost at which the durable good was purchased and
 the price the household expects by selling the durable good in the market
 at the time of the survey.
 While these data fields are promising for the intertemporal setting we
 wish to make use of, some refinement of this data is necessary due to the
 measurement errors with the costs and the current price (the latter is
 referred to as marked-to-market average or mtm average in the current discussio
n).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Since we compare durable goods with consumption of quality - we would argue
 that the durable goods purchased must also be considered in at an aggregate
 level - by the same argument on measurement error in quality in the previous
 section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue with the reported cost is typical of those based on a consumer
 recall.
 Recorded by the survey at two time-points spread across two years (let's
 call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs may change over a period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) may be significantly different from the cost recorded in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 To some extent, the reported cost of the durable goods follows the mtm
 average which itself is less susceptible to the issue as it is not recalled
 from consumer's memory and reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable
 good over time instead.
 The mtm average of the durable goods (like the cost of the durable good)
 is a value averaged over the number of durable goods owned by consumer.
 Therefore, the cost incurred by the purchase of a new durable good - that
 we're interested in - is not directly observed in the mtm average and relies
 on the field indicating number of durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the value of new purchases relies on the number of durable goods observed
 in the survey, we detect an durable good purchase only when a difference
 in the number of durable goods over the successive years is observed.
 The difference between the mtm average is thus recorded as part of new
 durable goods only as long as we observe a difference in number of durable
 goods in the two-year period (i.e.
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 The number of durable goods observed however is also subject to some measuremen
t error and requires some further refinements for us to calculate the total
 cost of durable goods.
 That said, since we are interested in the the new durable good purchases
 for our analysis, someone buying their first music player is unlikely to
 make counting errors than someone adding to their collection of music systems.
 We thus look for significant changes in durable goods numbers (e.g.
 if they change from 0 to 1 or substantially 3 to 5 or to 6,7...
 etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible issue with a calculation of durable good cost changes as outlined
 above is that the measurement error with the number of durable goods may
 get magnified for more expensive durable goods such as house.
 However, since we also observe whether the individual owns a house or not
 from the household questionnaire (which records the housing-status through
 a direct question), we confirm that this error is not significant after
 reconciling the calculated differences with the data from the household
 questionnaire.
 What this reconciliation does remind us however is that the durable goods
 recorded in the survey indicate whether the household uses (or has access
 to) the durable goods rather than what it owns
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A lot of households in rented or employer-provided houses report having
 a house.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since rental options - except for housing - are fairly limited in the developin
g economies, this does not pose a significant measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final caveat for the data is the presence of split households.
 A significant portion of the households may split into two or more households.
 Considering a split household as the terminal state of a household, we
 don't consider the parent household while calculating durable good differences
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 if it has terminated in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, durable good net-differences are included only as long
 as the households have not split in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+1$
\end_inset

.
 As explained in the discussion of the model, we only wish to consider durable
 goods that can be potentially transferred over generations (it is easy
 to verify these when the households are split).
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data, we consider any durable good more expensive
 than bed as eligible to be transferred to the next generation.
 This can be verified with the data on split household.
 The durable goods in the survey that are not life-long durable goods e.g.
 mobile phones, dish-tv etc.
 are not considered in the net-durable good changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{\tau+1}=A_{\tau+1}-A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a median-cost order of the durable goods recorded in 2014).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For robustness tests to our conclusions, we attempt to both sharpen and
 smoothen the data on durable goods changes by considering purchases within
 coarser groups such as electronic items, furniture etc.
 and by turning off the effect of depreciation in the durable good difference
 calculation respectively.
 The first test to sharpen the data is with classification of new durable
 goods into coarser categories - which is useful in its own right in order
 to interpret the distribution of functional durable goods - since counting
 the instances of purchases of just any electronic item may make more sense
 than the purchase of individual items such as a music system or a CD player.
 The appeal of the grouping approach is also due the extreme differences
 in urban and rural markets in an economy like Tanzania.
 Grouping the durable goods into agricultural electronic, electric and livestock
 categories accentuates the minor additions to one's durable goods - by
 giving the cheaper durable goods purchased by the consumer the same treatment
 as the more expensive durable goods.
 The downside with such a grouping is of course this very collation of durable
 goods with vast differences in prices within a single group (cd-player
 and music system for example may have vast differences in prices but could
 be counted as a new electronic durable good purchased).
 As our primary intention has been to get the total durable goods costs
 we have refrained from using such grouping as a primary means of analyses.

\begin_layout Standard
The method to smoothen the data on the other hand has clear advantages.
 As we have noted earlier, in every two years of the survey, the mtm-average
 by the household is susceptible to both how the household interviewee may
 estimate the change in the market and whether the interviewee from the
 household in a particular year is different from the interviewee household
 member in another year.
 The durable goods data can thus be smoothened by separating the effect
 of these factors if we can consider only only one year's prices.
 To explain this with an example, consider an durable good 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 whose value is 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the reported average mtm of the durable good at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of durable goods the household possesses.
 To avoid the measurement error associated with the difference in the estimate
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, we prefer to use the mtm-average estimate (price) at either from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the difference in cost of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 could be either be 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}P_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t}P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 Choosing the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 however leads us to another issue due to the sparsity of data.
 As we rely on a district-level granularity of data, not only would we not
 have the price reported for an item not owned by the consumer in period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, there may not be enough purchases in the district for us to estimate the
 cost of the item that consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One way to circumvent this is to classify all durable goods into cheap,
 middle-range and expensive categories based on cost quantiles in the period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and then determine the category of the durable good purchased in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 based on its price in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 The price at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would then by the price of matching category (expensive, middle-range or
 cheap) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Since, we may as well use the price at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, this indirect methods is rendered unnecessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As we're interested in the price for the new purchases (i.e.
 cases such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}>0$
\end_inset

), the prices at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset

) do not suffer with this issue.
 The expenditure on new durable goods calculated is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Delta n_{a,t+1}=P_{a,t+1}(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 a quantity that considers an mtm change less affected by the measurement
 error in the estimate provided by the household member interviewee.

Before we discuss these results, notice that the claim 2 can be evaluated
 in the data in the two different periods 2010-2012 and 2012-2014.
 The subsistence (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi,t}\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) is different in these years and it can also vary across the population
 e.g.
 in urban and rural areas.
 The Claim 2 says that when subsistence level costs increases but needs
 stay the same the status consumption should decline (i.e.
 no higher quality and no more durable goods).
 On the other hand, when subsistence becomes cheaper the status consumption
 should increase (more durable goods and/or higher quality).
 This should also be seen in the cross-section (a claim that Claim 2 does
 not encompass but the model also implies is that when the needs themselves
 increase as consumers move to urban areas or acquire more durable goods,
 status consumption would also reduce).
 The subsistence level costs amount to 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi,t}\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a function of the age of the individual and is calculated at the local
 level 
\series bold
DISTRICT/REGION/URBAN?

 - region and urban could be the same).
 The status consumption is a combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}=\frac{c_{t}-\Psi_{t}}{\psi_{t}}$
\end_inset

 - which are to be calculated at the local level as well.
 
\bar under
region X {urban,rural} seems the right way.
 The needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 are also aggregated at the needs cost level - we're interested in the how
 an urban consumer responds to high needs vs rural consumer to same needs.
 This is a cross section concern which can be visited first.

\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 is pre-determined and the interpretation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p})}{\partial P_{\psi}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial J}$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$

To be clear our measure for the price of quality is simply the calculation
 of quality against needs - As such higher subsistence level (higher price
 needs) prices would mean higher price of quality - provided the distance
 from needs is embedded in our measurement of the price of quality.
 Similarly, lower subsistence (i.e.
 lower prices of needs basket) would mean lower price of quality.
 Here what we mean by subsistence - is a level of utility - a sort of poverty
 line defined by the cost of the minimum basket 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which in turns depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

) .
 We think of a 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

as price function - that is estimated using total costs 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\rho)\nu_{i}+P_{\psi}(\rho)\psi_{i}+\Psi(A_{i},\rho)=c$

The typical life-cycle consumption patterns can be confirmed with the significan
ce of age-related coefficients.
 More particularly, the quality (excess) consumption seems to decline with
 age while durable good purchases do not seem to be influenced by age as
 much.
 Apart from the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and needs, the disposable income (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

) also depends on the durable goods someone owns through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which includes durable good-bearing costs).
 Thus a weak significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 simultaneously with a strong significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 implies a stronger effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that have much influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (durable goods such as land that do not require a high maintenance cost
 proportional to their cost are purchased less often than those that have
 higher bearing costs).
 Further, the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 is negative while it is positive for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that higher disposable income (lower needs or higher income)
 is more often associated with higher quality (excess) and less durable
 good purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is statistically weak, but the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is quite significant.
 More durable goods purchases are made by those who are already rich in
 relative terms, the new durable goods purchased are mostly those that are
 associated with high running costs.
 While the distribution of wealth - reflected in the ownership of expensive
 durable goods such as a house or land - do determine which consumers purchase
 new durable goods, the significance of disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

 (shown as lt1 in the table) - which we estimate using occupation, education
 and needs over the years 2012 and 2014 - and its negative coefficient for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 indicates that the new durable goods are purchased by those with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which is inclusive of durable goods bearing costs) and/or the new durable
 good purchases are by those who have relatively less incomes (
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 estimated through better occupation and education).
 This trend seems to reverse for the measure of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

Unlike the ownership of durable good such as land and housing, disposable
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the sort of wealth that lends to more social mobility.
 The educated and the highly-paid may pass on their skills and social networks
 to the progeny, but the transfer of such soft-durable goods to the next
 generation is more dissipative than the monetary wealth.
 Such soft-assets might not result in the ownership of more expensive durable
 goods (such as housing or land) but these do require consumption on education
 and social functions anyways.
 The durable good purchases may suggest the limits of the durable goods
 purchases.
 This is made clearer with the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for expenditure on quality(
\shape italic
excess

) consumption indicates.
 Those with less durable goods but with better income do seem to spend more
 on quality (including education).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in urban and rural lifestyles also play a role in the difference
 in durable good purchases as well as quality.
 This is in particular due to the the availability of electricity being
 limited to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for and more likely to
 deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.

 setting.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption in an environment of uneven prices for relative quality.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived risk in one's stability of wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the the participants exhibiting a risk-seeking
 behaviour (i.e.
 a disproportionate expenditure) towards goods and services that may lead
 to a large payoff (immense success) with a small probability (through joining
 golf clubs, engaging in social events - status competitions with a small
 upfront cost).
 This may serve as a refinement to the conventional assumptions of a balance
 between the urban and rural prices in the models that explore rural migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While visible items do capture such risk-seeking behaviours in the developed
 economies very well, the difference in wealth and the segregation of quality
 of life in the developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they
 may be in segregated societies in the developed economies).
 Without a
\bar under
 
\bar default
consideration of how the durable goods are distributed in the economy and
 are subject to change, one must be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed this is not to say that the consumption on items that are categorically
 visible does not tell us much about the demand in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption - and is worth exploring in its own right - but
 if one were to develop a theory of status consumption instead of revisiting
 visible consumption in varied cultural contexts in this manner, the considerati
ons of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership seem an obvious
 first step.
 Indeed in the particular case of marriages too, we would only improve our
 understanding of the bride price if we realise that marriages are both
 an indication of one's social status as well as a potential for advancement
 in social ranking - forces that are at play in durable goods purchases
 more generally in much the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the literature on rural and urban differences in the developing
 world should be extended to include status consumption on grounds of generality.
 The context of status consumption varies significantly across economies
 and one often needs to make adjustments for the particular social conditions
 to draw conclusions on visible consumption.
 Using an intertemporal behavioural model to explain consumption may help
 us in standardising the markets for status in disparate economies and help
 us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across the various states of economies.
