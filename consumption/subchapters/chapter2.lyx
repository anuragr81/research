\begin_layout Abstract
The economic inequalities in developing economies often persist both across
 wider geographical areas and within densely populated cross-section of
 urban areas.
 We uses the data on ownership of long-term assets and geographic locations
 for the districts where consumers reside - to explain the role that differences
 in prosperity levels observed in a normative reference area influence inequalit
y in educational expenses.

 as the higher percentile rank of the occupation in the US and find few
 changes in the intergenerational rank–rank correlations.
 Since 1850s, the managerial positions seem to employ a relatively less
 educated population - as education hasn't kept pace with the higher demand
 for managerial positions with the expansion of economy.
 All occupations (except the jurists, engineers - where required skillset
 seems to have expanded), therefore, have declined in the ranks thus defined.

 In the current chapter, we seek some reasons why - despite industrialisation
 being more recent in the developing economies - a general trend for intergenera
tional mobility may not be observed for the developing economies either.
 More specifically, we investigate how the asset-inequalities - across wider
 geographical areas and local income levels - may relate with educational
 expenses in two sub-Saharan African economies that exhibit different levels
 of urbanisation.
 As long as one may focus on the specific

There are two main reasons why the education-based human capital suffices
 for mobility studies in sub-Saharan Africa.
 First, the industrial development and universal education have been relatively
 recent phenomena in sub-Saharan Africa.

 note for example, that less than 40% children of parents who haven't completed
 primary education actually end up completing primary education in the sub-Sahar
an Africa (with an extreme variation across the continent - 2% for S Sudan
 and 80% for S Africa).
 Second, the income-based measures of intergenerational mobility (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fieldsmcgillivrayinequality2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) are often ruled out because the earnings or income-based recalls - as
 pointed out by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - are not meaningful in the surveys from developing economies (also see

(the inequality in higher education cannot be addressed without addressing
 the inequalites in primary education), the disparity in education expenses

Whether the effect of home dominate the effects of school is a contentious
 issues and we wish to shed some light on it by considering the differences
 in education and access to public or private education.
 In the current chapter, we compare the education-expenses for Tanzania
 and Nigeria against the prosperity levels (including the choice of private
 and public education) and the urban-rural divide in the economies.

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of prosperity - serving as an important control in the comparing
 of education expenses - is observed both within a geographical reference
 area and across geographical areas.
 More specifically, the differences in prosperity are measured as the average
 of long-term assets in the consumer's vicinity - acting as a proxy of the
 disparity in urbanisation across the wider geographic areas while the role
 of the consumer's higher permanent income on educational expenses is explored
 using the total expenditure (as suggested by the standard consumption theory
 - see

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The essential claim for the treatment of education as expenses for educational
 mobility is that a consumer who is better equipped with educational or
 occupational status may be better prepared for higher prosperity.
 Apart from with urban-rural and asset-ownership disparities, we compare
 educational expenses also across the current educational levels of the
 household head and the primary occupation (agrarian or non-agrarian) of
 the household head in both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 The empirical results are used to explain how the different contexts of
 income level and consumption in the two economies could result in disparate
 education expenditures and implication for educational mobility.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that such a comparison of consumption and education expenses
 against prosperity - both local and geographical - as well as the long-term
 characteristics of the consumer could be of interest for two specific areas
 of policy research.
 For one, the urban-rural and asset disparities have implications for migration
 pressures in the economy.
 More specifically, if the costs of living and amenities are less varied
 across reference areas in the economy, then a consumer may be indifferent
 between staying in a poorer reference and moving to a higher reference
 with higher relative poverty.
 The indifference indeed changes when the reference areas are extremely
 dissimilar in terms of opportunities - resulting in asymmetrical human
 capital investments (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corakintergenerationalmobility2004"

\end_inset

) and higher residential segregation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Second, education may also acts as a status item - since the mobility or
 occupational skills acquired through education may influence direct access
 to status-related consumption - increasing the inertia that prevents moving
 to a poorer reference (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

The question of allocation of public resources for educating a population
 in a developing economy has however opened itself to some fierce debates
 - the most prominent of which has been that of the choice between providing
 free basic education to all (at the point of use) and investing in higher
 education.
 The proponents of the approach promoting basic education for all have pointed
 out that the role of primary and secondary education is more important
 for growth in LDC nations than in the OECD economies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "petrakisgrowtheduc2002"

\end_inset

) and that the contribution of higher educational levels increases gradually
 as the level of development increases (see

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 has suggested - more particularly - that public finance should be diverted
 from higher education to primary education while letting higher education
 be privately funded.
 This suggestion has come under fierce criticism
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

- not least because of the returns-to-education methods used by

 argues that the positive externalities from education are not factored
 into the productivity measures that are used to argue against investments
 in higher education.
 That the individuals benefit culturally and physically from education -
 while reducing the costs of imparting social changes is not considered
 in the returns-of-education analyses used for developing economies.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 argued on similar grounds that only secondary or higher education may provides
 skills useful in the labour market and that primary education education
 rarely serves as a meaningful terminal level of education.
 While the returns-to-education approach is still used to explain the impact
 of education (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "soderbomReturnstoEducationTNZKYA2006"
literal "false"

 for example), it is generally agreed that the relationships between education

 productivity of educated workers (see

 has argued that the employment of the overeducated in the developing world

 argue that the graduates in sub-Saharan Africa are more likely to waste
 efforts in rent-seeking activities.
 The literature seems to suggest two contrasting explanations for the high
 unemployment among graduates and the relatively low participation of higher
 education in the region.
 On one hand it is argued that the insufficient gains in economic growth
 from education in sub-Saharan African countries are due to institutional
 problems and mismanagement in public education (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 On the other hand, it is also suggested that education has not focussed
 on skills for a informal economy and failed to provide the improvements
 in agricultural productivity

We find that the low participation in higher education and the lack of productiv
ity-centered nonformal education is entirely due to low or improper investment
 in education.
 Instead, the particular conditions of sub-Saharan Africa and the structural
 changes which the region has undergone in the last century have presented
 unique challenges that education alone may not have overcome.
 Considering the overall consumption pressures, for example, the region
 has been particularly susceptible to volatility in commodity prices (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "deatoncommoditypricesAfrica1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The environments of political instability and the presences of a large
 informal sector, may severely constrain a funding through taxation or financing
 that could be used for education.
 An economy increasingly reliant on commodity trading has also limited the
 political empowerment of lower-income workforce.
 Even though the recent alignment with the Chinese economy (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kaplinskychinesefdiinAfrica2016"

) seem to have improved the overall infrastructure in the region, the immense
 competition with China's producers has meant that the underdeveloped local
 industrial sector has failed to absorb the lower-income workforce (see

 the consumer compares herself to), a membership group (which the consumer
 thinks she belongs to) and a normative group (where the consumer gets her
 standards from).
 Other than the sense of reference group, the metric for identification
 a reference group varies across empirical studies.
 For example, the classic approach on relative income (see

The measurement of prosperity of the consumer's normative reference group
 relies on the importance of asset including land-ownership in African societies.
 The ownership of assets has been emphasised to be of great importance in

 Some studies have attributed migration pressures arising of land-distribution

In an environment of severe income inequalities of a typical developing
 economy, one would observe both that certain geographical areas are much
 poorer (richer) compared to others and that there are extreme income difference
s within the geographical area of reference (on average).
 In the current chapter, we set ourselves to measure how disparities in
 prosperity both across geographical areas and within a locality may affect
 intergenerational-educational levels and the educational expenses that
 influence future mobility.
 Here, a normative reference group defined over the consumer's vicinity
 is used to measure the levels of prosperity - which is interpreted as the
 average long-term assets within the normative group.
 The measurement of the prosperity thus relies on the market-value of assets
 (including land, housing) observed directly in the data (see Section

In its essence, a consumer balances i) increasing her consumption relative
 to the prosperity of her normative reference group with ii) preparing to
 be in an area of higher prosperity.
 More specifically, the consumer of a certain age selects a particular area
 of prosperity as well as a certain level of consumption relative to the
 reference level implied by the prosperity of the reference area while simultane
ously improving her chances of being an area of higher prosperity (with
 expenses that also depends on the reference area).
 The choice between educational expenses and other consumption is key to
 our survey of the two economies.

\begin_layout Standard
As explained earlier, the consumer's educational expenses encompass a notion
 of her preparedness to be in a reference area of higher prosperity.
 The notion also allows a consumer inertia from moving away to a poorer
 reference for a gain in relative positional advantage.
 More specifically, a consumer after having a certain educational level
 or having specialised in a particular occupation may not move back (due
 to lower utility implied) to the reference poorer in absolute terms (measured
 by average long-term assets in the reference).
 Similarly, acquiring assets that are tied to a particular area of reference
 (e.g.
 property or equipment) could bring an inertia by limiting the consumer's
 movement away from the current area reference and increase her readiness
 (due to the resale value of the assets).
 The asset-ownership and education level are thus important controls for
 our comparison of educational expenses.

If we can assume further that all the consumers are on a deterministic path
 of needs, then it is possible to understand the life-cycle effects in the
 framework as well.
 More particularly, the consumers with lower working age may have less accumulat
ions as well as needs while the households with older working ages may have
 higher needs and the imminent dissolution of assets to the progeny (with
 no bequest assumed).
 The costs of being in a certain area of reference with a given prosperity
 are akin to younger consumers investing in the prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 as older consumers shed the accumulated assets to the successive generations
 - maintaining the mobility and growth in the economy.

The arguments for treating educational expenses towards mobility different
 from consumption rely on the observation that the choice a certain area
 of prosperity is never simultaneous with that of consumption.
 Simply put, the fruits of selecting a better area of prosperity must arrive
 later than the consumption in one's reference.
 The selection of the prosperity - denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 - is thus similar in some ways to how a consumer may postpone fulfillment
 through asset accumulations in an intertemporal setting - but unlike with

 our analyses and is explored in the framework in two different ways.
 First, the effects of being in an agrarian occupation on educational expense
 and mobility are compared against those of local prosperity.
 Second, role of the prosperity is considered separately for among the agrarian
 and non-agrarian populations in the consumer's normative reference (immediate

The age

 of the consumer household and demographic characteristics such as religion
 are also important controls for an understanding of educational mobility
 and expenses.
 The role of age allows us to discuss the life-cycle effects in our analysis
 - as a consumer household having acquired more assets over her lifetime
 is less likely to aspire to improve her reference area by spending more
 on education.
 A similar inertia applies to having acquired more education itself - as
 a consumer household after having acquired a higher educational level or
 a certain occupation tied to a reference, may not consider a higher relative
 richness in a reference area of less prosperity despite the promise of
 higher relative prosperity in a poorer reference (due to liquid assets
 of the household).
 The consumer household's age, household-size and the social identity are
 thus important controls for the empirical analysis presented in Section

A concern with the above use of a nominative reference group may be that
 certain prevalent social groups in an economy could be the cause of a disparity
 within or across geographical areas - thus resulting in an omitted variable
 bias when ignored.
 While we do pay attention to social identities in the current study, we
 also note that such a social identity (race, religion or other) must both
 be observed at a wider level across all the geographical areas of reference
 and have a direct influence on the consumer's prosperity for there to be
 a significant bias.
 Since we don't find any evidence for a significant political disadvantage
 to a specific social identity in either Nigeria and Tanzania, the role
 of social identities across all the geographic areas are unlikely to be
 separate from the controls of prosperity (even if social identities may
 have a role to play at the finer levels within the geographical area of
 reference).
 This is not to suggest that the consumer societies in sub-Saharan Africa
 - much like elsewhere - are not organised around clans or social groups,
 only that the effect of reference groups implied by such micro-identities
 aggregated over larger areas are unlikely to be significantly different
 from the effect implied by prosperity of assets - so long as the diverse
 identities are dispersed over the wider geographical extent and do not
 form a separate social group with a direct prosperity disadvantage.
 In particular, if the communities within a geographical area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 do not share a social disadvantage with the community members in another
 geographical area 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, then the effects of different geographical reference prosperity levels
 in the two areas would dominate the factors for consumption.
 The relevance of social identities thus does not interfere with our definition
 of a normative reference group based on geographical locations.

The educational expenses and the non-asset related expenditures are used
 from the Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World
 Bank.
 We use the LSMS for the years 2012-2014 (Tanzania) and 2012-2015 (Nigeria).
 While the data for consumption diaries are available also for 2010 in both
 Nigeria and Tanzania survey, we ignore the year 2010 due the value of assets

 The asset-values rely on the stock of durable goods owned by every consumer
 available in the surveys - where the items range from the short-term durable
 goods such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such
 as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the the long-term assets that can be transferred
 over a generation - we focus only on the items that are costlier than the
 median furniture value in both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data for Tanzania.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts for the
 wider level consumer vicinity based on Euclidean distance.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards
 in the 6 
\begin_inset Formula $km$

Urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents in Nigeria whereas
 they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears get much costlier in Tanzania since the

 In Nigeria, these costs rise by about 54%.

While the overall poverty levels appear similar in Nigeria and Tanzania
 , the disparity in owned assets is observed to be more extreme in Tanzania
 (particularly between the south of the country and the east - see Figure

 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

We also note that the average consumer in the urban areas for both the economies
 - despite better options for lifestyle and consumption - seems to struggle
 with basic needs.
 To compare the fulfillment of basic needs in urban vs rural areas, we look
 at the fraction of consumers that have run out of food in the last 12 months
 in every district across both economies (either due to lack of agricultural
 inputs or high prices) in Figures

 These indicate a significant number of households running out of food in
 urban areas (due to high costs) - even though the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons).
 It only suggests that the expenditure on education may very much a luxury
 for a significant part of the population.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Parametric-Analysis"

, the key observation from the non-parametric view of the data is that the
 disparities in income and assets are more localised in Nigeria while they
 are more extreme across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure

The dependent variables used in the estimation described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Econometric-Method"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The two dependent variables - budget shares for educational expenses (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

) and non-durable expenditure excluding asset-costs (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ne}$
\end_inset

 ) - are used in the sureg estimation with price of non-durable expenditure
 in the consumer's vicinity as a control (see Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

).
 As described in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Econometric-Method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

 in the reference area - interpreted as the cost of living in the reference
 - are measured as the the average consumption excluding the asset costs
 in the consumer's vicinity.
 Based on the standard consumption theory (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the total household expenditures are meant to be related with the household’s
 permanent income - thus permitting the use of the logarithm of total expenditur
e 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 as the control for permanent income in the estimation.
 The results from the OLS estimation for 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 are shown in Tables

 for Tanzania and Nigeria respectively.
 The interpretation of references used in these results are as described

 are listed in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Of these control variables, some are specific to the individual household.
 More specifically, the age of the household age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
age
\family default
), the factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 (indicating whether the household head is employed in agriculture related
 occupation or not), the size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 of the household (
\family typewriter
hsize
\family default
), the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{t})$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
l
\family default
ogx), the education rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{*}$
\end_inset

 of the head of the household (
\family typewriter
\size small

), the ability to speak English 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter

 - used only for Tanzania) and religion 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
religion
\family default
 - used only for Nigeria and indicated by 1 for Christianity, 2 for Islam,
 3 for Traditional and 4 for other) vary for every household.
 The variables observed at the level of the reference area - are the number
 of rural wards 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 ( 
\family typewriter
\size small
rural_wards
\family default
\size default
- divisions within a district marked as rural in the survey), the logarithm
 of the per-head cost of non-durable consumption excluding assets costs
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\family typewriter
\size small
log_mean_cost_ne
\family default

 ) and the respective measures of the prosperity

 (as defined in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma,\tau,\Omega,r,\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

, the logit formulation also uses the education rank of the household head's
 father 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

(
\family typewriter
\size small
father_educ_rank
\family default
\size default
) as one of the control variables.
 Further, in an alternate formulation for educational expenses, we regress
 the logarithm of total expenditure on education against the same control
 variables as for 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ne},w_{educ}$
\end_inset

.
 The educational expense used both as the dependent variable and in the
 logarithm of the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 as the control variable causes a well-known endogeneity problem (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace,ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) that is resolved by instrumenting the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 with the occupation data in the survey.
 Accepting at most a rejection rate of 10% of a nominal 5% Wald test, the
 eigenvalue test statistic are higher than 20 (with the critical value of
 16.38) for all the regressions - and allow us to reject the null hypothesis
 that the instrument is a weak one.

%The panel with a random effects estimation (which assumes that fixed c_{t}
 is uncorrelated with any of the control variables x_{t} - and allows us
 to see the effect of r_{t} and other fixed characteristics) is more useful
 to understand the effect of prices rather than the fixed effects that don't
 change.
 For this reasons, we have focused on the cross-sectional approach.

The key goal of empirical analysis is to find out if the educational expenses
 in the two economies rise more sharply as a result higher prosperity in
 the local cross-section of incomes or due to disparities in prosperity
 across wider geographical areas.
 As education is a clear means for mobility, the disparity in education
 would imply a limited on mobility in the economy.
 The framework discussed in the previous sections is used to comment on
 the implications on education and mobility of the urbanisation trends in
 the two economies.
 As described earlier, the levels of urbanisation are proxied using the
 the asset-prosperity of the consumer's vicinity while the local income
 differences are accounted for using the control for permanent income.
 The analysis contrasts educational expenses and mobility in the two economies
 by looking at the relative effects of wider and local income differences.

 This seems largely due to the educational expenses being proportionately

 the agrarian households seem to be spending higher on education (compare

 In other words, the agricultural households spend higher on education in

We also see a strong significance demographic variables for educational
 expenses in both the economies.
 More particularly, we see that in Tanzania, the English-speakers spend
 significantly higher on education while in Nigeria, the educational expenses
 are higher among households identifying as Christian.
 The effects of age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and household-size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 point to the less surprising observation that the older householders with
 higher family units consistently spend higher on education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in educational mobility across rural and urban areas seem
 to be higher in Nigeria - suggesting that despite higher educational levels,
 the changes since last generation are more often limited to the urban areas
 in Nigeria.
 Once again, the households identifying as Christian or English-speaking
 in Nigeria and Tanzania, respectively, demonstrate a higher attainment
 of educational mobility.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
We had set ourselves to understand how wider disparities in urbanisation
 and improvements of income at local levels may affect the differences in
 educational expenses and mobility in the context of sub-Saharan Africa.
 Treating the educational expenses as investments in mobility, we find significa
nt effects of regional prosperity and institutional differences on both
 education expenses and mobility.
 Our results share many of the wider observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - who also highlight the role of religious and colonial institutions in
 the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.
 Since the agrarian consumers maintain a higher budget share on education
 expenses in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and higher education ranks correspond
 to higher education expenses in the developed economy (Nigeria), it would
 appear that the educational expenses remain higher after attainment of
 education by the consumers and increase in regional prosperity.
 This latter observation is aligned with the cohort-study from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who suggest that the labour with skills added through education is less
 willing to stay in agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the special cases for the two economies, we see that the separation
 of opportunities for education and mobility is stronger in Tanzania where
 agrarian occupations seem to lag far behind in basic education relative
 to the urban areas.
 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the level of urbanisation and access to
 education are generally higher but the differences brought about prosperity
 differences and religious institutions are significant.
 Thus while overall educational levels and expenses do rise with prosperity
 (as in Nigeria), the access to education as a means for mobility remains
 extremely segmented due to social factors and assets-prosperity in both
 the economies.
