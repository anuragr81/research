\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role of wealth inequalities
 in status consumption is less understood in the varied contexts of developing
 countries.
 We develop a model for status consumption based on the intertemporal consumer
 choice where status is viewed as part of the consumer's utility.
 The utility function used in the model comprises of both quality in non-durable
 consumption and owned durable goods.
 Using the data on durable goods ownership available in the Tanzanian LSMS
 consumption microdata, we discuss how a segregation of quality may characterise
 status consumption in a developing economy..

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent research suggests an ubiquity of status-related consumption and the
 relevance of peer effects in consumer demand

.
 One expects therefore that regardless of how poor an economy is, the consumers
 would maintain a consumption level relative to their reference group level.
 Since reference groups are subject to spatial and economic segregation,
 it follows that the disproportionate demand for signaling-goods (i.e.
 conspicuous consumption) would depend on the age-composition of the consumer
 population and the degree of social segregation.
 An insufficient communication amongst the reference groups imposed by region
 or social barriers could create reference groups so apart that the demand
 for conspicuous goods completely absent for some significant reference
 groups.
 In other words, if the poor in an economy are far too many, the poor majority
 may neither observe nor emulate the lifestyles of a rich microscopic minority.
 Such dependence of status consumption on poverty levels has been only partly
 explored by the studies on effects of income inequality on conspicuous
 consumption

 Germany after the economic liberalisation at the end of cold war to test
 if prolonged measures of suppressed incomes can influence visible consumption

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking a slightly different approach in this chapter, we view status consumption
 as a combination of expensive durable goods and high-quality non-durable
 consumption - comparing the two amongst consumers spread across different
 age-groups and levels of urbanisation.
 To endogenise the role of long-term durable goods and personal characteristics
 in status, we use an intertemporal model of consumer choice where both
 quality of consumption and long-term goods contribute to the consumer utility
 which is inclusive of status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That consumers compete in a social order by displaying their owned items
 and quality consumption - is based on a social deference based view of
 status that has been embraced in many economic studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 .
 If we can agree that the role of status consumption is to influence such
 a ranking, it follows that the status for a consumer with a fixed set of
 personal characteristics can only be improved either with quality in non-durabl
e consumption or with long-term durable goods (i.e.
 durable goods that can be part of inter-generational transfers).
 If the long-term durable goods are typically accumulated over generations,
 it follows that the demand for quality in non-durable consumption would
 be driven by a certain myopia relative to that for durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sense of quality in the conventional demand analyses is often interpreted
 from an aggregation of items over commodities as separable groups
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity,McKelveyQuality2011,McKenzie2005,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

.
 As the theoretical requirements for such an aggregation require a detailed
 set of market prices of goods within every commodity
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the view of status consumption as high-quality consumption is often hampered
 with a lack of information on brand/type variety in the typical consumption
 survey.
 The studies on conspicuous consumption can circumvent this issue by focusing
 on a particular instance of status consumption - comprising of (visible)
 goods that are meant to be futile for the general needs of the consumer.
 The futility of status goods ensures the separability of demand for visible
 goods - and views a narrowed context of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that the futility assumption cannot be made in severely unequal
 societies where wealth differences may be far too wide to be narrowed with
 visible (or high quality) non-durable consumption.
 As status consumption comprises both of quality across commodities and
 ownership of durable goods, the contribution of durable goods to the ranking
 order might dominate any changes with visible (high quality) non-durable
 consumption.
 Evaluating the above framework in the particular case of Tanzania, we discuss
 how quality in non-durable consumption could be segregated by long-term
 characteristics (e.g.
 such as education of parents) and availability of certain durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We hope that the framework with quality and durable goods with life-cycle
 effects that can used to test the significance of status consumption in
 an economy.
 A refinement of status consumption is particularly needed in the developing
 economies where both wealth differences and social segregation are relatively
 higher.

Status consumption was notably elaborated by Veblen

 in his 1899 treatise titled

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen seemed to have explored the
 psychological basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen hardly dwells upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assisted with the developments in game theory and an improvement in the
 quality of microdata from consumption surveys, an interest in Veblen's
 observations has been revived in the recent years (see Frank

 and Koustobinas

).
 The recent attention to status consumption - however - should not to be
 viewed asunder from the consumer demand literature on habit-formation (see
 for example Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for the classical treatment of quality and cost-of-living indices).
 It is possible to view status consumption in the intertemporal framework
 with life-cycle assumptions as a generalised inertia in moving away from
 a state of higher quality - a tendency that may in turn be determined by
 the long-term characteristics (such as social identity or education).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevance of social identities in consumption habits has been a common
 theme of much of the literature in conspicuous consumption (see Chao et
 al.

).
 The literature on marketing also finds the role of durable goods ownership
 in a formation of identities (see Corneo 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We believe it is possible to link the two threads - of identity and habit
 formation - if the role of social identity and ranking could be endogenised
 in an intertemporal setting with a substitution between the consumer's
 long-term and short-terms goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple view of status in the intertemporal substitution is one where it
 is a long-term concern for the consumer.
 This is aligned with the how status is usually viewed in the sociology
 and health studies literature (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 However, if status were only accumulated over long-term, there would be
 no utility from status consumption in the intertemporal framework.
 The seeming paradox is easily resolved with an approach that has been used
 by Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990"

\end_inset

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 - who view status as a ranking order of consumers based on their incomes
 that can be altered with consumption.
 In other words, a consumer achieves status utility through status consumption
 by moving herself up in a ranking order that is otherwise determined by
 wealth and income.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a formulation of status consumption also reminds us to exercise caution
 when looking at items in the developing countries that are considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed countries.
 As the relative wealth differences are more relevant for status differences
 in the developing countries where industrial development is concentrated
 into fewer urban areas, the wealth differences could have far more weight
 for status than the limited range of visible items available to a consumer
 in the developing world

 for criticism of a certain 
\shape italic

\shape default
view of status consumption.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This caveat on the relevance of wealth differences is not highlighted enough
 in the literature on conspicuous consumption we have surveyed (except for
 some studies directly exploring the effect income inequality on conspicuous
 consumption with exogenously observed poverty/income levels or GINI indices
 - see Jaikumar 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and Chai et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Some studies, for example, include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in status-related consumption while others choose to focus on
 non-durable consumption.
 An empirical view assisted with the intertemporal framework helps us assess
 whether particular long-term durable goods should be viewed as part of
 status consumption or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that status competitions are always relevant in one's own reference
 group, status consumption varies across several social strata - particularly
 in the developing countries where the wealth differences are wide.
 While the economic history of the developing world might suggest that lower
 classes tend to emulate the habits of past upper economic classes (see
 Timothy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TimothyBurkeLifebuoyMen1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SrinivasSanskritization"
literal "true"

\end_inset

), the overwhelming evidence for status consumption at finer levels marks
 the relevance of one's own reference group (see Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "FrankPond"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Chai
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 One possibility that hasn't been explored enough at the finer levels of
 consumption is that the visible goods too could vary significantly across
 the social strata.
 A luxury watch - for example - may be as useful as its pawned value in
 the poorest sections of a developing economy.
 That a common set of visible goods should be considered relevant for all
 participants in a consumer survey could therefore be subject to debate.
 One one hand, it could be argued that rapid industrialisation and a transformat
ion of consumer markets in many developing countries has resulted in a narrowing
 of income differences and creation of new markets for status (see Srinivas

 and Wisman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "WismanSavingClassIdentity2009"

\end_inset

) where every consumer can spend on the same set of visible items.
 The measurement of visible consumption would therefore sufficiently capture
 the essence of all status consumption.
 On other other hand, it could also be argued that despite recent economic
 developments, wide social inequalities have prevailed in the populations
 in both Asia and Africa and that the relevance of severe and widespread
 income inequalities on what may constitute status consumption cannot be
 fully discarded (see Khamis et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The questions in the consumer survey (which is how a researcher may obtain
 the list of visible items) may need to be adjusted to include items that
 may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A model for the combined effect of wealth and consumption on one's status
 thus becomes necessary to address the relevance of wealth differences in
 status consumption across varied cultural contexts.
 In a developing economy, the measure of wealth and income can be proxied
 relatively easily with the stock of durable goods the consumer has (inclusive
 of housing, land and other long-term assets) so that durable consumption
 contributes directly to the ranking order.
 The contribution of non-durable consumption - on the other hand - would
 be only through the quality of non-durable consumption.
 We argue that if a common set of consumer needs makes sense in the population
 being observed, then there is no status utility to be achieved through
 addressing of needs.
 This is because the consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfillment of consumer needs - which are the same for every one by
 definition - does not carry a similar influence on status.
 Thus if there is any status related utility to be derived from non-durable
 consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
quality (which is defined as distance from needs observed within a particular
 reference group).
 It also follows that any status that is not signaled with quality in non-durabl
e consumption must come out of long-term durable goods (i.e.
 the proxy of wealth).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement of ownership of long-term durable goods is relatively easier
 - if we consider long-term durable goods as only those that can be passed
 on by the consumer to the next generation (this has implications in the
 life-cycle model as we later elaborate).
 The short-term concerns of the consumer (which could themselves be influenced
 by the acquired wealth) comprise only of needs and quality (inclusive of
 short-term durable items - if any) which both determine the non-durable
 consumption by the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An appropriate measure of quality is therefore key to our empirical analysis.
 Since the consumption surveys hardly obtain brand-related details of the
 item, one must rely on alternative ways to distinguish higher than required
 consumption from a minimum necessary consumption.
 In much of the consumer demand literature on quality, for example, the
 measurement of quality relies on detailed market prices.
 If market prices are observed (as is often the case for food), quality
 is simply the proportion of expensive items standardised by quantity
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity,DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,McKelveyQuality2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 When quantities consumed and the details prices aren't available, a notion
 of quality can rely on the cost of a standard basket of basic needs ( i.e.
 the problem of cost-of-living indices - see Fisher 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 A measure of quality is thus simply the expenditure in 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
of the cost of needs
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since most empirical data is gathered at household levels, the larger households
 having more needs would require the consumption data to be scaled by the
 number of members - thus standardising the needs across households.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Our notion of quality thus in turn relies on a sound definition of basic
 needs - which provide the reference point for quality in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the cost of needs as a reference point, the very idea that there are
 universal needs has been a somewhat contentious issue.
 Again on one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by
 subjective preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs can supersede
 her subjective interests (wants).
 We have leaned towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need
 of the consumer without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts should be standardised.
 The basic needs of the consumer are the standard requirements not meeting
 which would lead to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory
 argued for by Doyal and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite.
 A starch diet fulfilling the set of dietary needs can thus be ruled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such an objective assessment of basic needs could also enrich the discussion
 on status consumption in the literature which often performs a rather subjectiv
e assessment of consumer necessities.
 Despite relying on the futility assumption (i.e.
 that conspicuous consumption is necessary futile), the empirical studies
 in status consumption tend to make varied assumptions about what to include
 as part of conspicuous consumption and what not to.
 The contents of the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption often include
 items that are just commonly understood to have some signaling value (jewelry
 etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 It is common in the literature to use a consumer basket identified from
 a different economy on the basis of items being of conspicuous value by
 common knowledge.
 A consideration of health and autonomy could provide an appropriate justificati
on for the futility of conspicuous consumption in a particular economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said the ideas of health and autonomy are somewhat subject to interpretatio
n in a particular context.
 In the LSMS survey data we use for Tanzania, for example, we treat the
 costs incurred by owning durable goods as part of needs only if the durable
 goods themselves are part of needs.
 The costs that the owner of a refrigerator or a large house (let's say)
 has to bear can only be part of basic needs if the durable goods themselves
 are a basic need.
 In the particular case of Tanzania, refrigerator isn't deemed a basic need
 while housing is.
 The other empirical issue with the measurement of quality is that certain
 maintenance costs for own durable goods may appear as non-durable consumption
 in the diary (we revisit this issue in detail in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While needs may serve as a necessary reference point for our notion of quality,
 the more relevant reference point for status consumption is consumer's
 group or regional identity.
 If the choice consumer faces is to either save for future or spend on status
 goods, she is likely to be concerned with the rich consumption in her immediate
 social surroundings rather than a distant (possibly richer) consumer.
 The factors of locality are thus relevant for the measurement of contribution
 to status utility from consumption
\begin_inset Foot

Notice that even if the prices of needs are considered in two different

 consumption (quality) has been substantial.

An interpretation of quality must therefore also rely on the distance of
 a consumer's non-durable consumption relative to the reference group's
 consumption level (i.e.
 the consumption in the immediate surroundings e.g.
 a locality, a relevant social group, income or owner group of the durable
 goods etc.).
 
\bar under
We assume that the cost of needs represent this social reference for non-durable
 consumption and include the estimated cost-of-needs from the long-term
 durable goods owned by the consumer as part of this reference point as
 well.
 Thus if total non-durable consumption in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 were 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

, the cost of needs (inclusive of the costs of maintaining long-term durable
 goods) 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$

 then the quality control is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}=c_{t}-\Psi_{t}$

\begin_layout Standard
The individuals with ownership of expensive durable goods tend to live in
 a region different than where those with low ownership of durable goods
 reside, there are two ways to include the peer effects - either as identity
 variable (region, neighborhood, class identity etc.) or as an average over
 the identity variable.
 Regardless of how these are measured, the status differences do exist across
 such identities (e.g.
 individuals in one region compare themselves to those from other regions)
 and the consumer must get utility from this identity in order for there
 to be a higher (lower) status utility from a richer (poorer) identity (e.g.
 region, class etc.).
 In other words, if consumers were to get utility from their durable goods
 and non-durable consumption alone, the consumer in the poor neighborhood
 does not really have a choice to move to the richer neighborhood.
 For status consumption to have some utility to the consumer, the utility
 function - which is the same for all consumers - must also use positioning
 so that a rich consumer with low-positioning can be convinced to trade
 places with someone in the poor neighborhood who has a higher (local) social-po
sitioning.
 For status consumption to have any meaning, there should be a reason for
 someone who is a small fish in a big pond to trade places with someone
 who is a big fish in a small pond.
 Indeed social positioning is what makes this exchange and the consequent
 utility function possible.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider for example the consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

\begin_inset Formula $R$

 who live in a poor region (small pond) and a rich region (big pond) respectivel
y.
 Let their non-durable consumption levels be 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{P},c_{R}$
\end_inset

 and the average consumption levels in the regions they reside be denoted
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

 Further, let's assume that the values of their respective long-term durable
 goods are related as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}<A_{R}$
\end_inset

 as are the averages of the regions 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

 respectively i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 <
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 If we also have the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P},\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 then the cost above needs can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=c_{P}-\Psi_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{R}=c_{R}-\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Since status is only achieved through durable goods and quality, for there
 to values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{P},A_{P})\sim(\nu_{R},A_{R})$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 would trade places (ponds) with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, the utility model would need to consider the role of regional identity
 or peer effects (proxied with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P},\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

, the durable goods values 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P},A_{R}$
\end_inset

 or simply the region dummy).
 This would allow 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 to increase her non-durable quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}$
\end_inset

 so that she is indifferent to moving to a rural area even for a higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}$
\end_inset

.
 Without a consideration of peer effects (through
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P},\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{R}>A_{P}$
\end_inset

or the regional identity), and a non-decreasing utility for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, there is no point of indifference at the which the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 would trade places with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 The model thus allows someone in the big pond to move to the small pond
 in exchange of local positioning.

Assuming that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular sense
 - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for visible consumption
 can be considered separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 We do not find futility assumption plausible for the data we observe in
 the developing countries.
\end_layout

 The most relevant feature of visiblity based models is the separability
 of necessary items from conspicuous items that is offered by assuming the
 conspicuous items are futile (an argument attributed to Veblen).
 As we prefer to include wealth differences using a general intertemporal
 setting for a developing economy, however, we use a slightly different
 approach to status consumption that is based on the role that long-term
 durable goods play towards status 
\begin_inset Foot

The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor
 that they belong to a club that poor don't (invidious comparison).
 While these could be related to snob and bandwagon behaviours (see Corneo

, the consumer's status is a combination of long-term security from the
 extreme fluctuations in her wealth and the short-term risk in advancing
 her social ranking she undertakes by engaging in higher-quality non-durable
 consumption.
 In contrast to the visible consumption models, we are more interested in
 the effects of wealth and characteristics such as residence or social identity
 on status-related consumption rather than the demand for items that are

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term consumer needs
 does not view status consumption as futile but relates it with measures
 of wealth.
 Status may not be changed by fulfillment of basic needs but is influenced
 both by long-term possessions and non-durable consumption in an intermporal
 setting that we use to understand the status consumption in an economy.

Status as utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to state one assumption which much of the model could follow
 from, it would be that status is constituted in the consumer's long-term
 utility.
 If not, the model's representative consumer would have no reason to engage
 in status-related consumption in any form.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a
 consumer can a achieve higher status in the model not only by the acquisition
 of durable goods (which is assisted with higher income) but also by the
 status promotion through consumption (which may enhance social interactions
 and improve self-image)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is worth clarifying that the consumer utility inclusive of status is
 not meant to describe consumer's beliefs.
 As non-durable consumption is myopic (i.e.
 it represents consumer's short term concerns) and savings cumulative (represent
s consumer's long term concerns), the status utility derived from quality
 in non-durable consumption in the model only differentiates the consumer's
 utility from long-term determinants of status (ownership of long-term durable
 goods and personal characteristics such as education).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The role of non-durable consumption is therefore two-fold in the model
 - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer and second, it
 also matches the high-quality consumption with status-related goals.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity in
 the present as well as a possible status advantage - since all else being
 the same, someone consuming a higher quality is likely to have more status
 than someone consuming a lower quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[HIERARCHY] The hierarchy of competitions is the other underlying theme
 in the model.
 All our possessions are temporary - some more than others.
 Social identity is most permanent of all, while ownership of durable goods
 are more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 The intertemporal substitution attempts to include social characteristics
 as the most permanent parameter to the utility function.
 To motivate an empirical analysis, we propose that the consumer avails
 a particular factor by competing only against those who are withing her
 long-term cluster in the order

 Consider a white and a black person - who won't observe the same average
 - their averages being calculated by assuming social processes that treat
 them differently.
 Empirically, the utility from

 A white and a black person becomes the same in non-durable consumption
 - the limitations are only due to avenues of

\begin_inset Formula $A$

 comes in.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 deviates a consumer from the basic needs - i.e.
 more 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 due to cost of maintaining assets.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 is of no value in comparison of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

\begin_inset Formula $\int_{A}\nu$

 But the effect of on

 If consumers of different

 How status is supposed to work is that a consumer can project 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 (or have the same utility as someone with

\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 An urbanite with high-quality consumption could be believed to be rich
 - in a way the rural person can't.
 It's because what we have absorbed due to political or economic movements
 is that the urban person on average has higher wealth.
 Similarly, a white person doesn't need real wealth to indicate higher status.
 A black person - comparing herself with other blacks - would not have real
 asset advantage.
 Comparing with whites, black is always disadvantaged.
 When comparing herself with the white person, combining 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,\rho$

 is not an option for the black person.
 This is an important point combining 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 Higher

Notice that relying only on the total costs associated with a commodity
 (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality or 
\shape italic

cannot differentiate between the consumption of a higher quantity and of
 a higher quality.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming

\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$

 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

 That said, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity
 are available in the region or not, it is possible to draw conclusions
 about over-consumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity (more so when a pseudo-panel analysis
 is used).

 The (first) reference point of needs is crucial to our notion of quality

 items as basic needs.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standardising needs in terms of the quantity of non-durable consumption
 poses yet another issue - since the non-durable consumption may depend
 on the long-term durable goods that the consumer possesses.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and thus a high non-durable consumption
 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical goods would not have
 the respective non-durable consumption).
 We get around this issue and solve the problem with standardisation of
 durable goods as needs by considering an extended set of necessities that
 are inclusive of the constraints imposed by the ownership of durable goods.
 This means that the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is changed corresponding to the particular level of durable goods ownership
 that every consumer has.
 We argue that counting the durable-goods-bearing costs as necessities makes
 more sense than counting it as quality of consumption.
 This is because the latter choice would double-count the utility that the
 consumer gets from the durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 To explain this with an example, consider a consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 with a refrigerator and another consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 without a refrigerator who both have the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 set all non-durable consumption.
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{R'}<\Psi_{R}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{R'}>c_{t}-\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

) .
 Does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 First, because the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Second, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity
 groups (over energy or durable goods for example).
 In fact, there is little sense in claiming that the quality in one commodity
 can be substituted with quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality is meaningless unless one considers the cost
 of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The notion of excess is thus the only way to assess overall quality in
 non-durable consumption.
 If having a refrigerator is not considered a need, then we may say nothing
 more than that 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

.
 By avoiding counting maintenance costs in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, we merely maintain that interpretation
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is possible that ownership of some durable goods generates some rental
 income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, such income would be considered an additional stream of income instead
 of reduction in the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In other words, the measure of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is thus conditioned for such costs in order to avoid the double-counting
 the durable-goods owner advantage by differencing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 inclusive of the costs of maintaining durable goods from

An alternative to including the durable-goods-bearing costs instead of adjusting
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is to view the owners and non-owners of durable goods as separate reference
 groups.
 This is akin to considering owners of durable goods as separate peer groups
 - the averages over which would be considered as different quality levels.
 This approach has its advantages but since the number of durable goods
 to be considered are likely to be high - one may not have enough data within
 every durable good owner group for the empirical analysis to follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter approach is however the only option available when unlike with
 the case for owned durable good we don't observe the direct costs associated
 with a long-term choice e.g.
 that of residence or education (part of the the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 If someone moves to an expensive neighborhood, then their consumption is
 likely to change in accordance with neighbours.
 Other than the prices, there is no direct constraint imposed on the consumer
 - except through the herd behaviour inherent in residing in an expensive
 neighbourhood.
 In such cases, considering different groups based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is feasible as well since the number of characteristics are likely to be
 limited.

[CLEARS UP CONFUSION OVER EDUCATION - as assets] The above clears up an

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 require an investment and have a value in the employment market.
 A long-term choice should be considered as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in the model only as long as the costs of maintenance can be included in
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
 If not, then the long-term choice must be considered as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (an educated individual is not required to pay a maintenance fee for having
 been educated).
 The empirical method for adjusting necessities based on the durable goods
 one possesses is straightforward if we assume a typical usage for all expensive
 durable goods owned.
 If a household possesses a car, then the needs of the household would be
 incremented with the petrol consumption per year and maintenance for a
 typical usage.
 This also means that some costs of needs (e.g.
 for food) are multiplied by the number of household members in the family
 while other needs aren't - as we obtain the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for a particular household (see Section

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical distinction between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may also require some clarification as it is not always obvious if a certain
 cheaper durable goods such as appliances should be considered as part of
 quality in non-durable consumption instead.
 For reasons that'll become clear in the discussion of the intertemporal
 setting in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, a durable good is considered part of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and thus its cost of maintenance are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) if it can be passed through generations.
 The durable goods that cannot be passed through generations are not considered
 long-term and excluded from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ( this is due to the life-cycle considerations that are later explained
 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, if quality is measured as the distance from cost of needs,
 the sunken cost that the owner of a durable good incurs due to ownership
 may imply that quality in non-durable consumption necessarily together
 with ownership of durable goods.
 This is no longer necessary if one considers the costs associated with
 durable goods as part of the cost of necessities.
 Notice that this does not interfere with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 moving together with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 due to consumer's demand.
 More specifically, even after costs of ownership of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are deducted from non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a period (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}=c_{t}-\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) the quality demanded 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 could move together with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a population of consumers also because 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 may not be improved beyond a certain point until 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 too is increased.
 For example, in the household category, high prices of housing may encourage
 the consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

) but she may only improve the overall quality instead of buying a bigger
 house only until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 The consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is thus likely to move together with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that the consumer acquires.
 Inclusion of maintenance costs in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not interfere with this co-movement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a co-movement is likely in demand and would result in a limited substitutio
n between quality and durable goods.
 The limited substitution between durable goods and non-durable consumption
 thus allows us to express the consumer utility as an additive function
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon=f(A)+g(\Psi)+m(\nu)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are the durable goods owned, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 the cost of needs (or a scale of needs) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 the quality of non-durable consumption.
 The co-movement of quality and durable goods also means that the quality
 differences in the durable goods can be ignored if the quality in non-durable
 consumption is already being considered.
 A high-quality durable goods is therefore merely a more expensive durable
 good in the consumer's utility
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although not used in the current analysis, the price derivatives can readily
 enter the utility model if the price of needs and quality can be estimated.
 Consider first an environment of without price changes.
 Here, the consumption of quality would change only when individuals acquire
 long-term durable goods or give up hopes of acquiring costlier durable
 goods (possibly due to other needs).
 As the consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality, a rise in
 quality must come either from an increase in income or from an undercut
 in savings.
 Similarly, if needs stay the same, a drop in quality must be due to purchase
 of durable goods or a drop in income.
 Empirically, the prices are attached with a commodity rather than overall
 quality.
 So, to consider price changes, one must consider the price of needs as
 well as the price of quality across the various commodities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Faced with change in prices, a consumer may prefer quality in one commodity
 over another (i.e.
 a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport to food or
 vice versa) as she addresses her needs and long-term durable goods requirements.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider a middle-income family that
 moves to a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants
 are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place.
 One way to view this change in the consumer's circumstances is to observe
 that the price of entertainment services are lower for the consumer in
 the new neighborhoods.
 Assuming the needs of the family (indicated by the number of family members)
 haven't changed, the consumption would either shift to saving for a better
 car or improve quality in some other category (better jewelry, better schooling
 for kids etc.) in response to price changes or a equivalent changes in income.
 The sensitivity of consumption with respect to price thus comprises of
 sensitivity with respect to basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\Psi_{t}}$
\end_inset

as well as a sensitivity with respect to quality for each commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\nu_{t}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The assumed structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\Psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 implies that a consumer could achieve the same utility - inclusive of status
 - as that of a consumer with a higher education or higher durable goods
 ownership (higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) by raising her excess non-durable consumption (or quality).
 This would accommodate the likely clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 associated with a characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g education, housing, identity, region or barriers owing to segregation,
 trade barriers etc.).
 In other words, a peer effects approach is readily incorporated in the
 model (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Peer-Effects-Simplification"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that status is not considered a need using this
 approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the level
 of durable goods ownership she achieves while her basic needs are independent
 of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both expensive
 durable goods and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class needs of the
 consumer).
 As an example, the difference between the status of a rich and that of
 a poor family in our model is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 the family combined with a demand for quality for education (with a higher
 price for higher quality).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consideration of a consumer's wealth - which separate the rich and non-rich
 consumers - is assumed to be encompassed by the accumulated durable (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) and long-term characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (education, occupation or social identity) in the model.
 The ownership of durable goods is modeled with an asset account - whose
 value is reflected in the total cost of durable goods.
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase durable goods and the actual
 purchase of durable goods.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all long-term
 durable goods in the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success
 to preferences being the same for everybody) that provides furniture, housing
 and all amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every durable goods  and service - offered as a life-long subscription
 - can be purchased by giving an amount to this company.
 We also assume that at the of the lifetime of a consumer, her personal
 wealth would either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so
 that the asset account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth
 of some other household(s) in the economy.
 Consequently, while all individuals in the population are assumed to be
 the same as our representative consumer in terms of the preferences for
 needs over quality, they do differ in the the starting amount of their
 asset accounts as well as the trends of their salaries.
 The quality habits of quality (
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
) depend on these long-term characteristics.
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and her salary after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 then at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased some long-term durable-goods from a portion of
 her income - deciding that she does not want more durable goods for the
 rest of her life.
 Alternatively, she could have experienced a change in the life-circumstances
 (needing a bigger or a more expensive house) thus needing more durable
 goods urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Due to the minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing countries,
 we assume a negligible credit in the market.
 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only durable goods available in the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To separate the measures of wealth from the long-term characteristics that
 drive the household income, we use an income process that is estimated
 exogenously.
 Unlike in PIH, the accumulation of long-term durable goods have an influence
 on the substitution between savings and quality in the intertemporal setting
 we have chosen.
 What this means empirically is that while the exogenous income process
 may depend on education or occupation levels, the effect that long-term
 characteristics have on consumption are not necessarily through income
 but through the constraints associated with levels of durable goods ownership.
 As the effects of on consumption are modeled explicitly, it would suffice
 if the income process models only the monetary growth i.e.
 a reflection of the steady growth in the economy on the consumer's budget
 (in analysis of the Tanzanian data in the current chapter, an income process
 dependent on long-term characteristics such as education and occupation
 is assumed).

 Other than the control

The non-durable costs imposed by the durable goods one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees

 long-term choices or characteristics (e.g.
 not having a house or living in a region that doesn't have electricity
 available) would limit the choice to avail quality through non-durable
 consumption.

 The intertemporal substitution between durable goods

 Notice that the utility of long-term durable goods is not supposed to change

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2}$

 instead of consuming all her income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$

 she can spend all her income

\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{0}$
\end_inset

 If we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 Let this utility be 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*},A_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 To extend this to two periods with dynamic optimisation one can exploit
 the fact that a consumer independently optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 would always obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are unbounded functions 
\begin_inset Formula $max(u_{1}+u_{2})\le max(u_{1})+max(u_{2})=u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is only a tool to formulate the dynamic optimisation approach - using which
 the expected value of utility is to be optimised over her life period in
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

-period model (
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 being the age of the consumer).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The changes in expected utility per period are what drive her behaviour
 at every period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and her choice is set to vary according to her age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (assuming that all consumers have similar expectations for the trajectory
 of their needs).
 A steady state would thus be achieved with ages 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 .
 The conditions of stability of the steady state imply that while consumers
 maintain different 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

, they are a function of characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the notion that a consumer may change her behaviour away from the
 current plan in the future is fallacious since a consumer observed at different
 ages is equivalent to consumers of varied ages at any point in time (see
 Deaton's clarification of the so-called dynamic inconsistency problem

 In other words, the behaviour of an older consumer is the same as the future
 behaviour of a younger consumer.
 So the optimal solution for the total sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{T-t}u_{i}$
\end_inset

 would apply both to the individuals of all ages as well as an individual

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 Indeed the more educated people or those in better occupations (or those
 with higher perceived class) might need less durable goods and less quality
 to indicate status.
 We therefore include 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

Due to the high upfront cost attached to owning long-term durable goods,
 there may be a certain levelling effect to the extent to which durable
 goods may be used to compensate for not having the most favourable 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 Thus the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 may dominate the choice for non-durable consumption.
 In other words, ownership of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is quite likely to be segregated amongst those with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 An influential or a high-status 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has two competing roles for the consumer utility - first, it allows the
 consumer to not require as many durable goods as those in a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Second, it requires the consumer to maintain a certain level that is required
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 she possesses.
 This interplay of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is allows us to model the role of peer effects - i.e.
 that claim that the consumers consider quality relative to her reference
 group rather than an absolute level.

If peer effects were to be modeled explicitly, let's say through a distance

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) are also wealthy, the consumer with a high status rank due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would also need to keep up the quality consumption to her wealthier reference
 level.
 Therefore, those in the higher rank (e.g.
 higher status occupations etc.) would benefit both from being in a higher
 status group (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) and from the higher durable goods possession that entails being in the
 high status group (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 To avoid double-counting for the effect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has on the utility, we choose only the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that form the reference group over which the distance from average consumption
 is considered relevant for peer effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some recent literature has found an ordinal treatment of status more suitable
 for modeling status-related consumption.
 We believe that the properties of the average over the particular personal
 characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 allows us to consider an ordinal treatment without losing the tractability
 of averages in estimation.
 If we are sure to consider only the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that can serve as a reference group for consumption, then the presence
 of peer effects only means that the consumer does not worry about having
 less 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 than the average of a community (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 ) which she does not consider herself a member of.
 Instead, the utility derived by being ahead of the local average (of quality
 or durable goods) i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is more significant to her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To consider what this simplification offers to the econometric methods to
 follow, consider a market of just quality (and no durable goods) as an
 illustration.
 Here, a model for utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $S=a\nu+b\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu$
\end_inset

 which is similar to the Ireland's signaling model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - in the sense that the utility is a combination of private and public
 sub-utilities.
 The model for 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

\begin_inset Formula $S=a\nu+b\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above can be interpreted as how the total utility can be seen as a combination
 of the sub-utility from the distance in quality from the local average
 and that from the overall effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 This interpretation permits us to approximate the first term with a function
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and the second term with a function solely of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 The consumer thus maintains both a relative advantage and the collective
 absolute advantage from quality - without issues of double-accounting.
 The approach would not change if difference in durable goods were introduced
 in the model.

 Peer effects don't matter for needs - because they're needs - so the best
 way to include the effect of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the measurement of distance from needs which
 we track with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is not a measure of peer effects in itself.
 The distance from needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in fact only encompasses the higher price of the items or their consumed
 quantity.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 must be included in the

Ideally, we should use a measure of needs rather the cost of needs.
 We use 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 not only because it is observed directly (rather than the quantities which
 are not observed) but also because it encapsulates the regional variation
 in prices.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The last assumption rests upon the definition of long-term durable goods
 being intergenerational (and thus long-term enough for their utility to
 not change over time).
 The subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is used to signify that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 does not change with personal characteristics the way 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 does not change with age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 The utility that the consumer gets from from the same level of quality
 and long-term durable would - on the other hand - vary with both personal
 characteristics (reference group) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 Due to the very definition of needs, preference of the total cost of needs
 does not vary with

[BIG AND SMALL FISH] There are three things that matter to status - first
 the long-term characteristics

\begin_inset Formula $\nu-\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and relative long-term durable goods value 
\begin_inset Formula $A-\bar{A}$
\end_inset

 Other than status the utility is made of needs - 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

 which changes both with time and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $A-\bar{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 do not vary with time.

 are also likely to change with both 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 We'll have to make the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 don't change with time.
 The key assumption that we seek is whether a consumer entering into a new
 area would adjust to habits of those around them - or would executve her
 habits in the new environment.
 This would determine whether a utility is obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (just by moving to the neighborhood) so that doesn't need so much 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (Counterintuively ,therefore the poor consumer gets more status utility
 from the poor neighborhood.
 ) or because she has already got enough weight due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 or if there is a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\nu}=f(\rho,A)$
\end_inset

 that she uses to determine her non-durable consumption.
 In either cases, the role of needs is important.
 In a poor neighborhood, needs are so the cost-function would be lower -but
 the direct function for needs itself is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 This is only a matter of empirical analysis - where we would only have
 dummy variables for social characteristics (unless there is a continuous
 index of social ranking being used).
 We therefore assume a direct utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

[BIG AND SMALL FISH] It is worth considering if there is ever a reason why
 an individual with more wealth in absolute terms in a rich area would trade
 places with.
 If a model doesn't allow for that then there is no value in status consumption.

 compete with non-durable consumption.

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 Let's consider two consumers with wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 who live in an urban and rural settings where mean wealths are 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{U}$

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{R}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Let's also assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 has more overall wealth than 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U}{\bar{U}}$
\end_inset

 is much less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{R}{\bar{R}}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the rural consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is relatively richer in her community than 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 in hers.
 Using our terminology, the consumers gets utility i) from being either
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and ii) from the relative advantage 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U}{\bar{U}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{R}{\bar{R}}$
\end_inset

 (respectively).
 Notice that if we didn't consider the role of the reltive advantage realised
 in a community, then a richer consumer would always appear to have a higher
 utility.
 Being in an urban area may have a higher utility (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{U}>\bar{R}$
\end_inset

) but relative advantage would allow a rural consumer with less wealth than
 an urban consumer (
\begin_inset Formula $U>R$

[BIG AND SMALL FISH] If we add another social characteristic on top the

 For example, instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{R}$

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{R}_{middle}$

 We can also assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{R}_{low}<\bar{R}_{middle}<\bar{R}_{high}$

 But a consumer with lower

 by raising her 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 The essential question is whether the consumer gets utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu-\bar{\nu}$

 or from 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\nu}-\bar{\hat{\nu}}$

 This is another empirical question.
 Do users of refrigerator compete with the amount of electricity they're
 using? Probably not, do owners of a house compete with decorating their
 house (with those who don't and those who do)? Yes, likely.
 But there are differences between paying electricity bills and buying carpets
 for one's house.
 The latter is less easily justified as a runnig cost.
 Thus if we assume that the consumers don't compete with running costs,
 we also need to make sure - that the running costs of long-term durable
 goods do not overlap with the non-durable consumption for quality.
 In econometric analysis, this necessitates a discussion of how needs are
 separated.

 identity.
 Also worth remembering is that any non-durable consumption other than what

Cost of Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input for the cost of needs is the diary of food items and the recall
 diary for upto one year.
 The consumption of the items that are considered necessities is calculated
 for the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 The cost of needs thus calculated in this manner (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) depend on the particular locality where the household is located.
 Given the categories of consumption in Tanzania i.e.
 food, household, energy and transport, we calculate the cost of basic needs
 as the cost of minimal requirements in every category.
 As an example, we use the commodity sub-groups of carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables in the food category.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - which is composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - are then calculated in each region and district based
 on the prices of the items recorded in the survey (which records the prices
 at the district level as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket could be a
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - as these are most often
 the cheapest items in their respective sub-group (
\begin_inset Formula ${carb,fact,protein,fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the cost of this basket thus calculated is much higher
 in the urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 The cost thus calculated is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the food component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and https://energypedia.info/ for data on typical energy usage in the developing
 countries).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 The costs of clothing in the region for a particular year are included
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The running costs of the house - depending on whether it's owned or rented
 are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 When the house is rented, the running costs are simply the reported rent
 on the house whereas when the house is owned by the household, a 2.5% of
 the cost of the house is used (the maintenance rate is estimated based
 on the expenditure reported in the survey for the houses that report maintenanc
e on the owned house) .
 The matching of need with the level of durable goods owned is similar to
 how the energy costs are set up based on the type of durable good one possesses.
\end_layout

Under transport category, the public-transport costs and petrol consumption

 imply that one should not expect the consumption associated with a durable
 good to have signaling advantages.
 Thus, a user of electricity does not have much signaling advantage when
 compared with a non-user of electricity.
 In terms of the model, the user of electricity may indicate a higher status
 to those who don't have access to electricity through the ownership of
 electrical items rather than the consumption (part of

Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the income process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

, we use the reported income from primary occupations in the Tanzania LSMS
 data over the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 One limitation of the Tanzanian LSMS data is that it does not provide income
 data for every household head for which the consumption diary and durable
 goods are recorded.
 Another limitation of the data set is that a household that is visited
 in a particular year is less likely to be visited after more than 2 years.
 This means that while a significant number households would be common between
 2010 and 2012 as well as between 2012 and 2014, very few households that
 were visited in 2010 would be visited the third time in 2014 (in fact less
 than 100 household from the survey in 2010 seem to be visited in 2014 for
 income survey).
 Such a lack of a true panel data compels us to prepare a pseudo-panel for
 the calibration of the income process.
 The pseudo-panel we prepare is based on the similarity of the number of
 adults, the number of children, the year of birth of the adults, the occupation
 and education levels
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A minor issue encountered while the preparation of the pseudo-panel related
 to the age of the household members was circumvented with an approximate
 matching of that year-of-birth values.
 The LSMS community survey appears to have recorded the year-of-birth values
 for individuals in years 2010 and 2012 but the age variable is recorded
 instead for the year 2014.
 Matching the year-of-birth values from 2012 with the YOB values inferred
 from the recorded age was made possible by allowing a tolerance for matching
 the YOB values for the preparation of the pseudo-panel.
\end_layout

 While the FE GLS estimator for the pseudo-panel passes the Hausmann tests,
 we favour the use of RE estimator since the of time-invariant cross-sectional
 variables are important for the estimation of Equations

Durable goods 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey includes everything from
 a mobile phone to land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 The details of records include the number of durable goods owned by the
 household, the reported cost at which the durable good was purchased and
 the price the household expects by selling the durable good in the market
 at the time of the survey.
 While these data fields are promising for the intertemporal setting we
 wish to make use of, some refinement of this data is necessary due to the
 measurement errors with the costs and the current price (the latter is
 referred to as marked-to-market average or mtm average in the current discussio
n).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue with the reported cost is typical of those based on a consumer
 recall.
 Recorded by the survey at two time-points spread across two years (let's
 call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs may change over a period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) may be significantly different from the cost recorded in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 To some extent, the reported cost of the durable goods follows the mtm
 average which itself is less susceptible to the issue as it is not recalled
 from consumer's memory and reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable
 good over time instead.
 The mtm average of the durable goods (like the cost of the durable good)
 is a value averaged over the number of durable goods owned by consumer.
 Therefore, the cost incurred by the purchase of a new durable good - that
 we're interested in - is not directly observed in the mtm average and relies
 on the field indicating number of durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the value of new purchases relies on the number of durable goods observed
 in the survey, we detect an durable good purchase only when a difference
 in the number of durable goods over the successive years is observed.
 The difference between the mtm average is thus recorded as part of new
 durable goods only as long as we observe a difference in number of durable
 goods in the two-year period (i.e.
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 The number of durable goods observed however is also subject to some measuremen
t error and requires some further refinements for us to calculate the total
 cost of durable goods.
 That said, since we are interested in the the new durable good purchases
 for our analysis, someone buying their first music player is unlikely to
 make counting errors than someone adding to their collection of music systems.
 We thus look for significant changes in durable goods numbers (e.g.
 if they change from 0 to 1 or substantially 3 to 5 or to 6,7...
 etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible issue with a calculation of durable good cost changes as outlined
 above is that the measurement error with the number of durable goods may
 get magnified for more expensive durable goods such as house.
 However, since we also observe whether the individual owns a house or not
 from the household questionnaire (which records the housing-status through
 a direct question), we confirm that this error is not significant after
 reconciling the calculated differences with the data from the household
 questionnaire.
 What this reconciliation does remind us however is that the durable goods
 recorded in the survey indicate whether the household uses (or has access
 to) the durable goods rather than what it owns
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A lot of households in rented or employer-provided houses report having
 a house.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since rental options - except for housing - are fairly limited in the developin
g economies, this does not pose a significant measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final caveat for the data is the presence of split households.
 A significant portion of the households may split into two or more households.
 Considering a split household as the terminal state of a household, we
 don't consider the parent household while calculating durable good differences
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 if it has terminated in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, durable good net-differences are included only as long
 as the households have not split in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+1$
\end_inset

.
 As explained in the discussion of the model, we only wish to consider durable
 goods that can be potentially transferred over generations (it is easy
 to verify these when the households are split).
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data, we consider any durable good more expensive
 than bed as eligible to be transferred to the next generation.
 This can be verified with the data on split household.
 The durable goods in the survey that are not life-long durable goods e.g.
 mobile phones, dish-tv etc.
 are not considered in the net-durable good changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{\tau+1}=A_{\tau+1}-A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a median-cost order of the durable goods recorded in 2014).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For robustness tests to our conclusions, we attempt to both sharpen and
 smoothen the data on durable goods changes by considering purchases within
 coarser groups such as electronic items, furniture etc.
 and by turning off the effect of depreciation in the durable good difference
 calculation respectively.
 The first test to sharpen the data is with classification of new durable
 goods into coarser categories - which is useful in its own right in order
 to interpret the distribution of functional durable goods - since counting
 the instances of purchases of just any electronic item may make more sense
 than the purchase of individual items such as a music system or a CD player.
 The appeal of the grouping approach is also due the extreme differences
 in urban and rural markets in an economy like Tanzania.
 Grouping the durable goods into agricultural electronic, electric and livestock
 categories accentuates the minor additions to one's durable goods - by
 giving the cheaper durable goods purchased by the consumer the same treatment
 as the more expensive durable goods.
 The downside with such a grouping is of course this very collation of durable
 goods with vast differences in prices within a single group (cd-player
 and music system for example may have vast differences in prices but could
 be counted as a new electronic durable good purchased).
 As our primary intention has been to get the total durable goods costs
 we have refrained from using such grouping as a primary means of analyses.

\begin_layout Standard
The method to smoothen the data on the other hand has clear advantages.
 As we have noted earlier, in every two years of the survey, the mtm-average
 by the household is susceptible to both how the household interviewee may
 estimate the change in the market and whether the interviewee from the
 household in a particular year is different from the interviewee household
 member in another year.
 The durable goods data can thus be smoothened by separating the effect
 of these factors if we can consider only only one year's prices.
 To explain this with an example, consider an durable good 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 whose value is 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the reported average mtm of the durable good at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of durable goods the household possesses.
 To avoid the measurement error associated with the difference in the estimate
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, we prefer to use the mtm-average estimate (price) at either from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the difference in cost of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 could be either be 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}P_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t}P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 Choosing the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 however leads us to another issue due to the sparsity of data.
 As we rely on a district-level granularity of data, not only would we not
 have the price reported for an item not owned by the consumer in period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, there may not be enough purchases in the district for us to estimate the
 cost of the item that consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One way to circumvent this is to classify all durable goods into cheap,
 middle-range and expensive categories based on cost quantiles in the period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and then determine the category of the durable good purchased in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 based on its price in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 The price at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would then by the price of matching category (expensive, middle-range or
 cheap) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Since, we may as well use the price at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, this indirect methods is rendered unnecessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As we're interested in the price for the new purchases (i.e.
 cases such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}>0$
\end_inset

), the prices at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset

) do not suffer with this issue.
 The expenditure on new durable goods calculated is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Delta n_{a,t+1}=P_{a,t+1}(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 a quantity that considers an mtm change less affected by the measurement
 error in the estimate provided by the household member interviewee.

 The disposable income

 are represented with At and c.At#c.age represents the interaction between
 the age and

\end_inset

 (the c.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical life-cycle consumption patterns can be confirmed with the significan
ce of age-related coefficients.
 More particularly, the quality (excess) consumption seems to decline with
 age while durable good purchases do not seem to be influenced by age as
 much.
 Apart from the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and needs, the disposable income (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

) also depends on the durable goods someone owns through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which includes durable good-bearing costs).
 Thus a weak significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 simultaneously with a strong significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 implies a stronger effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that have much influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (durable goods such as land that do not require a high maintenance cost
 proportional to their cost are purchased less often than those that have
 higher bearing costs).
 Further, the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 is negative while it is positive for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that higher disposable income (lower needs or higher income)
 is more often associated with higher quality (excess) and less durable
 good purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is statistically weak, but the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is quite significant.
 More durable goods purchases are made by those who are already rich in
 relative terms, the new durable goods purchased are mostly those that are
 associated with high running costs.
 While the distribution of wealth - reflected in the ownership of expensive
 durable goods such as a house or land - do determine which consumers purchase
 new durable goods, the significance of disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

 (shown as lt1 in the table) - which we estimate using occupation, education
 and needs over the years 2012 and 2014 - and its negative coefficient for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 indicates that the new durable goods are purchased by those with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which is inclusive of durable goods bearing costs) and/or the new durable
 good purchases are by those who have relatively less incomes (
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 estimated through better occupation and education).
 This trend seems to reverse for the measure of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the ownership of durable good such as land and housing, disposable
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the sort of wealth that lends to more social mobility.
 The educated and the highly-paid may pass on their skills and social networks
 to the progeny, but the transfer of such soft-durable goods to the next
 generation is more dissipative than the monetary wealth.
 Such soft-assets might not result in the ownership of more expensive durable
 goods (such as housing or land) but these do require consumption on education
 and social functions anyways.
 The durable good purchases may suggest the limits of the durable goods
 purchases.
 This is made clearer with the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for expenditure on quality(
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
) consumption indicates.
 Those with less durable goods but with better income do seem to spend more
 on quality (including education).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in urban and rural lifestyles also play a role in the difference
 in durable good purchases as well as quality.
 This is in particular due to the the availability of electricity being
 limited to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for and more likely to
 deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a need to exercise caution in the interpretation of the tobit /
 OLS results using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which - in econometric terms - is treated as a proxy for prices, regional
 variations, age and the effects of wealth.
 To allow our conclusions to be more robust, it may be worthwhile to to
 decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 into more control variables - possibly by reformulating the model in the
 Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dAt_regression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 to employ a quantile regression based on age, income, durable good costs
 - while still maintaining the key purpose of the model which is to separate
 means of income from wealth in an analysis of the intertemporal substitution
 between durable good purchases and quality (excess) under a life-cycle
 setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived risk in one's stability of wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the the participants exhibiting a risk-seeking
 behaviour (i.e.
 a disproportionate expenditure) towards goods and services that may lead
 to a large payoff (immense success) with a small probability (through joining
 golf clubs, engaging in social events - status competitions with a small
 upfront cost).
 This may serve as a refinement to the conventional assumptions of a balance
 between the urban and rural prices in the models that explore rural migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While visible items do capture such risk-seeking behaviours in the developed
 economies very well, the difference in wealth and the segregation of quality
 of life in the developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they
 may be in segregated societies in the developed economies).
 Without a
\bar under
 
\bar default
consideration of how the durable goods are distributed in the economy and
 are subject to change, one must be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed this is not to say that the consumption on items that are categorically
 visible does not tell us much about the demand in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption - and is worth exploring in its own right - but
 if one were to develop a theory of status consumption instead of revisiting
 visible consumption in varied cultural contexts in this manner, the considerati
ons of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership seem an obvious
 first step.
 Indeed in the particular case of marriages too, we would only improve our
 understanding of the bride price if we realise that marriages are both
 an indication of one's social status as well as a potential for advancement
 in social ranking - forces that are at play in durable goods purchases
 more generally in much the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the literature on rural and urban differences in the developing
 world should be extended to include status consumption on grounds of generality.
 The context of status consumption varies significantly across economies
 and one often needs to make adjustments for the particular social conditions
 to draw conclusions on visible consumption.
 Using an intertemporal behavioural model to explain consumption may help
 us in standardising the markets for status in disparate economies and help
 us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across the various states of economies.
