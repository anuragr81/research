\begin_layout Abstract
The income inequalities in a developing economy exist both across the wider
 geographical areas and within the densely populated urban areas.
 We compare the expenditure on asset possessions with that on opportunities
 for mobility across the income levels and regional disparities in Tanzania
 and Nigeria to comment on how consumption in a typical developing economy
 responding to changes in urbanisation levels may have implications for
 migration pressures and status consumption.

 explains that the reference group could be a comparative group (one the
 consumer compares herself to), a membership group (which the consumer thinks
 she belongs to) or a normative group (where consumer gets her standards
 from).
 Depending on the particular context, the criterion for identifying a reference
 group varies in the literature.
 Despite the different approaches, the notion of reference groups remain
 of key importance in much of literature in social sciences - including
 the current behavioural approaches to decision under risk (see

\begin_layout Standard
The chapter explores how consumption towards educational mobility varies
 in a developing economy with respect to prosperity.
 The notion of relative prosperity is considered both within a geographical
 reference area and across geographical areas in the economy.
 We consider that an improvement in prosperity for the consumer residing
 in a certain area of reference may depend on her inheritable wealth, her
 occupational or educational status and any positive externality (or affluence)
 associated with being in the area of reference of a certain prosperity
 level.
 Using a utility model for the problem, we perform a within-country survey
 of mobility opportunities in Tanzania and Nigeria.
 More specifically, the utility we formulate in the study comprises of the
 three variables - the consumption in the area of reference, the area of
 reference itself and the expenditure that prepares the consumer to be in
 richer area of reference.
 Assisted with this formulation of the consumer utility, we compare the
 educational expenditures - interpreted as the consumer's preparedness to
 be in a improved surrounding area - against the consumption on assets (durable
 goods) and non-durable consumption in the current study.
 .
 The results from the empirical analyses are then used to explain how the
 different contexts of income level and consumption in the two economies
 could result in the differences on education expenditures.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that such a comparison of consumption and education expenses
 against prosperity of the region and consumer characteristics such as education
, asset-level and occupation may be of interest for two reasons.
 First, the consumer characteristics and prosperity have a direct role to
 play in the overall mobility for the consumer.
 This may in turn have implications for migration pressures in the economy.
 More particularly, if the costs of living and amenities are less varied
 across reference areas in the economy, then a consumer may be indifferent
 between staying in a poorer reference and a moving to a higher reference
 with higher relative poverty.
 This - however - changes when the difference in reference areas are extreme
 in terms of opportunities.
 Second, the distribution of educational and occupational skills across
 the economy influences the access to certain types of consumption - which
 may have implications for status-related consumption in the economy.
 When a poorer reference has less opportunities both for mobility and status
 consumption, then the escape to a richer reference may act as a door to
 an improbable mobility - which may amount to a lot more than a mere gain
 in absolute income.

In an environment of severe income inequalities in a typical developing
 economy, one would observe both that certain geographical areas are much
 poorer (richer) compared to others and that there are extreme income difference
s within the geographical area of reference (on average).
 The current model considers the effect of occupational and educational
 levels on consumption while incorporating the choice of the area of a certain
 prosperity as the consumer's normative reference group - where the levels
 of prosperity are interpreted as the average long-term assets within the
 boundary of the reference area.

The representative consumer in the model balances i) increasing her consumption
 relative to the prosperity of her normative reference group with ii) preparing
 to be in an area of higher prosperity.
 The consumer thus selects a particular area of prosperity by optimising
 a reference-bound utility that she achieves from i) being in the reference
 area of a certain prosperity itself ii) achieving a high expenditure relative
 to the consumption level in the reference and iii) improving chances to
 be in an area of higher prosperity (while simultaneously increasing her
 chances to have a higher income).
 In other words, the consumer selects a particular area of prosperity with
 a given total income 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 that can be spent on preparing to be in an area of higher prosperity, purchasin
g long-term assets or availing non-durable consumption within the area.

 Other than this exogenous relation with

 With the choice to move to a different area of prosperity incorporated
 in the model, the consumer in a certain area of reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$

 obtains a utility from consumption (including assets) in the area

\begin_layout Standard
In a long-term equilibrium with a reference-bound consumption utility, no
 consumer must see any advantage in moving away from her chosen area of
 prosperity.
 In this equilibrium, not only does each consumer get the best possible
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $x(r,\rho)$
\end_inset

 given her personal characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 ( including the readiness to move to a different area) from her reference
 of prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 , but the overall prosperity also declines if a consumer moves to a different
 reference in the equilibrium.
 Any expenditure by a consumer towards improving her chances to be in a
 richer reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

 (with respect to her current area of reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

While it could also be argued that higher assets are generally associated
 with higher income in an economy (consumer with higher assets get favoured
 get non-transactional benefits from being richer), we consider such effects
 to be reflected in the consumer's static characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in equilibrium.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume the reference-bound utility to be an increasing function of the
 consumption - consisting both of liquid assets and the non-durable consumption.
 The expenditures that enhance the consumer's preparedness to move to a
 different area of prosperity - which also contribute to the utility - are
 treated different from the expenditure on consumption.
 These expenditures encompass the notion of the preparedness of the consumer
 to be in a higher reference.
 This latter expenditure on mobility allows an inertia from moving away
 to a poorer reference for a gain in relative positional advantage.
 For example, a consumer after having a certain educational level or having
 specialised in a particular occupation may not move back (due to lower
 utility implied) to the reference poorer in absolute terms (measured by
 average long-term assets in the reference).
 Similarly, acquiring assets that are tied to a particular area of reference
 (e.g.
 property or equipment) could also bring an inertia to the consumer by limiting
 her movement away from the current area reference and increase her readiness
 due to the resale value of the assets.
 The utility function must therefore allow both the inertia and mobility
 to depend on the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and the prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 of the consumer's normative reference group (we comment on the combined
 effect of these in the empirical analyses presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 It is implicit also that all areas of prosperity in the economy except
 the one with the highest richness offer a fair chance of improvement a
 reference of a slightly improved richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in the consumer's proximity.
 Since urban settings offer an environment that cannot be replicated in
 the rural environment, this ensures that the choice to move up to an area
 of higher prosperity is always relevant for every consumer.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice the sub-utility from consumption being bound to 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 means that there are diminishing returns from consumption relative to a
 particular reference of prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

.
 In other words, the consumer in a poorer area of reference may be satisfied
 with the same or lower absolute consumption than that of the average consumer
 in the richer area of prosperity.
 It is also implied that a higher income 
\begin_inset Formula $x(r,\rho)$
\end_inset

 would always make the choice to be in an area of higher prosperity a lucrative
 one - since the utility from relative richness with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is limited.
 Thus the consumer also derives utility from the preparedness to improve
 her prosperity which improves her income 
\begin_inset Formula $x(r,\rho)$
\end_inset

 by letting her change her area of prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 or enhance the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 In equilibrium, the consumers in a given reference

\begin_inset Formula $x(\rho,r)$
\end_inset

The differences in ages

 In equilibrium, the consumers with lower working age may therefore have
 less accumulations as well as needs while the households with older working

 progeny (no bequest assumed).
 This is akin to younger consumers investing in 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

\begin_layout Standard
The core argument for the different treatment of expenses towards mobility
 and consumption in the model is that the choice of a certain area of prosperity
 is never simultaneous with that of consumption.
 In other words, the fruits of selecting a better area of prosperity must
 arrive later than the consumption in one's reference.
 This selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is thus similar in some ways to how a consumer may postpone fulfillment
 through asset accumulations in an intertemporal setting - but unlike assets,
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 being associated with an area of reference brings additional costs to all
 consumers in the area of prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 while controlling the consumers' income 
\begin_inset Formula $x(r,\rho)$
\end_inset

.
 The substitution between selecting an area of prosperity and the consumption
 thus makes sense in the long-term equilibrium - when each consumer makes
 no utility gain by moving away from her current area of reference.
 This equilibrium is where the consumers with the same income

 to have different consumption values - i.e.
 the non-durable consumption

\begin_layout Standard
A concern with the use of a nominative reference group may be that certain
 prevalent social groups in an economy could be the cause of a disparity
 within or across geographical areas - thus resulting in an omitted variable
 bias when ignored.
 For this to be true, however, such a social identity (race, religion or
 other) must both be observed at a wider level across all the geographical
 areas of reference and have a direct influence on the consumer's prosperity.
 While we do consider the controls corresponding to religious affiliation
 and linguistic preferences in the two economies, we also don't find any
 evidence for a significant political disadvantage to a specific social
 identity in either Nigeria and Tanzania.
 Therefore, while social identities may have a role to play at the finer
 levels within the geographical area of reference, their role across all
 the geographic areas are unlikely to be more significant than the controls
 of prosperity and geographical disparities.
 This is not to say that the consumer societies in sub-Saharan Africa -
 much like elsewhere - are not organised around clans or social groups,
 but the effect of reference groups implied by such micro-identities at
 the finer levels are unlikely to be significant if the diverse identities
 are dispersed over the wider geographical extent and do not form a separate
 social group with a direct disadvantage to their prosperity.
 If the communities within a geographical area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 do not share a social identity with a community in another geographical
 area

 A key control is the prosperity of the area of reference chosen by the

 along with this first interpretation of prosperity in of the consumer's
 normative reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 (a high-paying occupation is one that provides higher than the median income
 on average).
 The use of manual/non-manual factor variable

 is based on occupation-distinctions used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and distinguishes occupations requiring more than the primary education.
 The second interpretation considers the average prosperity at the same
 occupation level as that of the consumer.
 The higher or lower occupation levels used in the reference prosperity
 level is based again on the income quantiles from the data on income in
 the surveys for both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 The control 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 for agrarian/non-agrarian occupations is used with the second interpretation
 of reference.
 Lastly, the third interpretation of the reference treats identity into
 the manual and non-agrarian occupation in the locality separately.

The range of occupations available to the consumer populations in the surveys
 from Tanzania and Nigeria are varied.
 To compare the role of occupations in the two economies, we standardise
 all the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria into
 occupation ranks ranging from 0 to 3.
 The occupation ranks are essentially based on sorting the varied occupations
 in the two economies by the income of consumers in the respective countries.
 The occupation-ranks mapped from the occupation levels in Tanzania and
 Nigeria are presented in Table

In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this the sparsity of income data - a problem aggravated
 because of informal sectors of a significant size in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 for Tanzania and Table

 for Nigeria).

We also note that the average consumer in the urban areas - with better
 options for lifestyle and consumption - seems to struggle with basic needs
 as well.
 To compare the fulfillment of basic needs in urban vs rural areas, we look
 at the fraction of consumers that have run out of food in the last 12 months
 in every district across both economies (either due to lack of agricultural
 inputs or high prices) in Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TanzaniaFoodShortageAgrInp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 This does suggest a significant number of households running out of food
 in urban areas (due to high costs) - even though the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons).

While we undertake a more detailed view on consumption in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Parametric-Analysis"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the non-parametric view indicates that the disparities in income and assets
 are more localised in Nigeria while being more extreme in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the disparity in asset ownership across regions is not nearly as extreme
 as in Tanzania.
 We discuss the implications of this non-uniformity on consumption in the
 subsequent sections.

\begin_layout Standard
The two countries have different levels of urbanisation but may be on a
 similar trajectory.
 Policy tell us that the pressure on education may be natural and could
 be seen as urbanisation needs.
 We explore a linear causality with the question: do people spend more education
 as the prosperity increases ? How does this vary against other variables
 such as the mothers/fathers/educ.
 Urbanisation - is measured as prosperity and expenditure on education is
 seen as readiness for mobility.
