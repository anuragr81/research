Status consumption under severe inequalities

- a case study in Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role played by wealth
 inequalities and spatial exclusion in the varied contexts of developing
 economies is explored less often.
 We develop a model for status consumption considering permanent ownership
 and high quality the primary indicators of status in a framework of intertempor
al substitution.
 Incorporating the opposite effects of peer influences and extreme wealth
 differences on status competitions in the model, we use the data on durable
 goods ownership from the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata to discuss
 how a segregation of overall quality in an environment of price heterogeneity
 may characterise status consumption in a developing economy.

[NOT GOOD- who says relative to refernce group means the same status consumption

.
 The ubiquity of conspicuous consumption implies that consumers must maintain
 a consumption level relative to their reference group level regardless
 of how poor an economy is.
 But since reference groups themselves are subject to spatial and economic
 boundaries, the conspicuous consumption in an economy would also depend
 on the extent to which the social reference groups are segmented across
 the population.
 It is quite possible thus that the demand for certain conspicuous goods
 (not commodities) is completely absent in some reference groups that are
 excluded spatially or economically

 in conspicuous consumption - as the consumers need not emulate the rich
 if their social reference is insulated from the higher requirements of
 income corresponding to a group outside their own social reference.
 In other words, if the status competitions for a group do not include a
 significant number of consumers outside their own reference or peer group,
 the status consumption would be necessarily segmented across the groups
 formed on the basis of a particular social characteristic (e.g.
 class, region, race etc.).
 One may hardly claim therefore that the poor majority in a largely impoverished
 economy observes and emulates the lifestyles of a rich microscopic minority.
 The opposing effects of poverty levels and peer-influences on status consumptio
n have not been explored in much detail in the literature - except some

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore status consumption in the context of wealth differences and social
 segmentation, we fall back to the notion of how status consumption is used
 to offset existing inequalities in income and economic standing.
 Instead of focusing on the disproportionate demand for signaling-goods
 (i.e.
 conspicuous consumption), therefore we adopt a model based on a social-deferenc
e view of status that has been embraced in many economic studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The model thus developed considers permanent ownership ( owned long-term
 goods ) and quality consumption as the key indicators of status that offset
 the existing income and social hierarchies.
 If the role of status consumption is to influence a ranking of income and/or
 wealth, it follows that two consumers with the same personal characteristics
 and the same set of needs can compete with each other for status only with
 quality in non-durable consumption and ownership of long-term durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We incorporate the effects of poverty and peer effects in the model where
 the consumer obtains utility through her social characteristics, quality
 in non-durable consumption and long-term durable goods.
 The consumption for quality and permanent ownership subject to the heterogenous
 prices are then explored across different age-groups, regions and levels
 of urbanisation in an economy.
 The model endogenises the role that personal characteristics (such as social
 class, level of education) play in status through the ownership of long-term
 durable goods and the constraints on quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[CONTRAST WITH VISIBLE CONSUMPTION] While measuring permanent ownership
 is relatively easy in the empirical analyses when the assets owned by consumers
 are recorded in the consumption microdata, the measurements of quality

 turn out to be less attractive due to their reliance on observed market
 prices of items.
 A workaround is implicitly adopted by the visible consumption studies -
 which focus on items that are assumed to be futile for common use (an assumptio
n attributed to Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 Without an assumption of futility of conspicuous items, the measurement
 of quality derived from an aggregation of items over commodities as separable
 groups

\end_inset

 would depend on the observed prices of items.
 While the futility assumption does ensure the separability of demand for
 visible goods, it does so at the cost of limiting oneself to a narrowed
 context of quality.
 We thus avoid making the futility assumption and use a more general notion
 of quality that permits any high-price non-durable consumption or a durable
 good to contribute to status - a notion which we feel is necessary to represent
 the conditions of a developing economy where basic needs are unmet for
 a significant portion of society.
 This notion of quality is measured as the

 non-durable consumption given the cost of basic needs (both external and
 internal) - which are measured in data at a district-level granularity.

In the empirical analysis that follows, we use the context of the saving
 vs consumption under an observed heterogeneity of price of relative quality
 to understand how status consumption may vary across the population observed

 Our quantitative model for the combined effect of wealth and consumption
 on one's status - which we use to describe the seemingly opposite effects
 of peer influences and poverty on status competitions - is aimed to be

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen has explored the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.

 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

 We argue that this recent attention to status consumption need not to be
 viewed asunder from the consumer demand literature on habit-formation (see

 for the classical treatment of quality and cost-of-living indices).
 Using the intertemporal framework with life-cycle assumptions, we view
 status consumption as an inertia in moving away from a state of higher
 quality - a tendency that may in turn be driven by the long-term characteristic
s such as social identity or education.
\end_layout

 We suggest that a model that views consumption in the context of status
 as a ranking order based on income or wealth could be used to endogenise
 the role of social identity in conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the notion of status most commonly used in literature - where it
 is seen merely as a long-term characteristics of the consumer - is hardly
 one that can relate social identity with consumption.
 The view of status as a static characteristic - which allows the studies
 in sociology and health sciences to use status as simply a vector education
 or income (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a few examples) - in fact poses a necessary paradox when used in the
 context of consumption.
 If status were only accumulated over a sufficiently long-term, how can
 there be any utility from status consumption? The paradox is trivially
 resolved if one considers that status is subject to change with consumption
 - just the way it is shaped by income or education.
 This dynamic view of status - provided by Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and having been widely embraced in the economic studies - presents status
 as an income-based ranking order that can be altered by the consumer with
 consumption.
 A consumer achieves thus status utility through status consumption by moving
 herself up in a ranking order that is otherwise determined by wealth and
 income.
 This is the view used in our intertemporal formulation of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To motivate a discussion of the role which social characteristics play in
 status consumption, we revisit how wealth differences may matter towards
 status consumption.
 Instead of assuming that the status-indicating goods in a developing country
 must be the same as those that are considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed economies, we also consider the role that wealth differences
 could play towards status differences in the developed economies.
 We argue that the wealth differences may have far more weight towards status
 than the limited range of visible items available to a consumer in the
 developing economies (where industrial development is concentrated into
 fewer urban areas).
 The relevance of wealth differences towards status consumption has not
 been discussed in great detail in much of the literature on conspicuous
 consumption we have surveyed (except for some studies directly exploring
 the effect income inequality on conspicuous consumption with exogenously
 observed poverty/income levels or GINI indices - see Jaikumar

\end_inset

 and Chai et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In fact in much of the literature, the inclusion of long-term durable goods
 (e.g.
 housing) in status-related consumption has been rather arbitrary.
 We believe that viewing status consumption in the context of wealth differences
 could also guide the assessment of whether a particular long-term durable
 good should be viewed as part of status consumption or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we could consider the social identities in the same ranking order as
 of wealth, the consumption beyond fulfillment of needs could be viewed
 as the consumer's attempt to alter the wealth order.
 However, however are two problems with this approach.
 First is that the social identities (tribes, castes, race etc.) may not
 always be observed as crisp categories of wealth.
 Second, the social identities are always associated with a particular scope
 and the competitions to reach a higher status may also be separated by
 the scope of social identities.
 While some social identities could be perceived to be of higher status
 than others, it is also true that individuals that are too poor or too
 different from other groups might not compare themselves with those that
 are either too rich or too different from themselves.
 This does complicate the role that social identities plays towards consumption
 as they both i) limit the status consumption within themselves and ii)
 carry a status value to those outside the respective social groups.
 Notice that it is only outside the reference group driven by one's identity
 that a social identity may influences status the way wealth differences
 would.
 Within the scope of the social identity that determines a reference group,
 the social identity doesn't carry much status to those in the reference
 group (since everybody carries the same social identity).
 Therefore when a social identity - which determines a reference group -
 also limits competitions for status within itself, one may no longer assume
 that lower economic classes would unconditionally emulate the habits of
 upper economic classes (i.e.
 pecuniary emulation as defined by Veblen) or even participate in the same
 status competitions as those who are perceived to have higher status (see

 and Chai

 for an empirical perspective on reference groups).
 This implies a possible segmentation of status goods and consumption thereof
 across the groups that are defined by social-identities (see Ustuner-Holt

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 (which is how a researcher may obtain the list of visible items) is adjusted
 to include items that may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since social identities are themselves often a result of long-term wealth
 differences, the first problem may not arise in most empirical studies
 - where the direction of wealth differences and the influence of social
 identities towards status could be practically indistinguishable.
 Even though there may exceptions to this alignment - economies that are
 undergoing fundamental changes may see older identities disappear and get
 replaced by newer ones - such problems can be dealt with empirically.
 To resolve the second issue, one must consider how status consumption (i.e.
 the status items therein) may be segmented across the different social
 classes in an economy.
 The combined effect of social identities and wealth differences on status
 is the quantitative concern that we wish to address with a model for quality
 and permanent ownership.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this model, a consumer changes her status by achieving both permanent
 ownership of goods and relative quality.
 If status is viewed as a ranking order based on long-term characteristics
 such as income, education and other social characteristics, the consumers
 are to compete with each other in order to offset the deep wealth and social
 hierarchies that determine the ranking order (see Corneo 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In an empirical analysis, the two status indicator variables whose measurement
 is critical to the model's operationalisation are i) the wealth of a consumer
 which we could proxy relatively easily in a developing economy if the stock
 of durable goods the consumer has (inclusive of housing, land and other
 long-term assets) is made available and ii) the quality in non-durable
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within non-durable consumptin, we only consider quality's contribution towards
 status because the fulfillment of basic needs alone is not expected to
 offer any advantage in a status competition.
 More specifically, a consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) would have higher status than another consumer consuming less
 quality if the needs of the two consumers are the same.
 As long as a common set of basic consumer needs can be assumed for two
 consumers, there is no status utility to be achieved through addressing
 of needs alone.
 The claim has a particular implication for our model of utility - if there
 is any status related utility to be derived from non-durable consumption,
 it would be constituted in the felicity from 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
quality (which is defined as distance from all needs tied to a particular
 reference group).
 It also follows that any status in a particular reference group that is
 not signaled with quality in non-durable consumption must come out of the
 possession of (and thus utility from) the long-term durable goods (or the
 proxy of wealth).
 Life-cycle assumptions are thus implicitly included in the model as long
 we can view a durable good as one that can be passed on to the progeny.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is possible to proxy wealth through measures of good possession
 in the empirical data, a robust empirical measure of quality has been subject
 to much debate in the literature.
 This is owing primarily to the lack of sufficiently detailed consumption
 surveys.
 Most consumption surveys hardly record the market-observed prices or the
 quantities of the items consumed - let alone the brand-related details
 of the items.
 This makes the identification of higher quality somewhat non-trivial.
 In fact the market-prices of items purchases or even quantities consumed
 - which could permit us to view quality as the proportion of expensive
 items standardised by quantity (see Nelson

) - are seldom recorded in the consumption surveys.
 In the instances where they are recorded, they tend to be limited to the
 food items alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the absence of quantities consumed and the detailed prices of key diary
 items, we thus use the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quality by considering a higher-than-required consumption based on a minimum
 necessary consumption (this is similar to the problem of cost-of-living
 indices in the literature - see Fisher 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "false"

\end_inset

for the classical approach to the problem).
 The variation in the cost of a standard basket of basic needs across the
 regions and districts in the economy provides the varying cost of needs
 that is used as the basis of this measure for quality.
 As long as the basic needs of the consumer in an economy can be determined,
 the measure of quality is simply the expenditure in 
\shape italic

of the cost of needs.
 An empirical assessment of what is consider 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 therefore becomes key to our definition of quality - much as it is for

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, a precise definition of the consumer needs has not been without
 controversy.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs can supersede
 her subjective interests (wants).
 To fix a particular definition of needs for own empirical analyses, we
 lean towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need
 of the consumer without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts should be standardised.
 The basic needs of the consumer are thus the standard requirements not
 meeting which would lead to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the
 theory argued for by Doyal and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite.
 A starch diet fulfilling the set of dietary needs can thus be ruled out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ideas of health and autonomy may appear slightly abstract but they can
 interpreted as the internal needs of the consumer in a particular cultural
 setting.
 We view the internal needs of a consumer household as those that are driven
 by the biological needs of the household.
 Thus the reference level of the basic internal needs of the consumer can
 be inferred with a measure of the biological needs of the consumer household
 (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - representing number of household-members, number of children, individual
 age, body weight etc.).
 That said, the notion of quality as consumption in excess of needs also
 depends on the consumer's external needs which encompass more than her
 health and autonomy.
 Consider for example the question of whether lodging/home-ownership or
 the primary education of children in the area where a consumer resides
 should be considered a basic need or not.
 Evidently, such needs are determined by a social reference rather than
 biology.
 Using the biological needs alone as the reference level consumption in
 fact amounts to ignoring the the peer effects that have a role in choice
 for status goods.
 The utility that a consumer avails from the relative quality depends on
 her perception of what she considers necessary (which comprise of the external
 needs) rather what is dictated by biology alone.
 The inclusion of peer effects - i.e.
 external needs - is therefore necessary in a measure for quality as it
 determines the reference consumption level for the consumer along with
 the price of basic needs which the consumer faces.
 There a basic-needs basket - whose cost varies with observed prices in
 a given region - serves as the cost of internal needs whereas the social
 or spatial context of the consumer identified by the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and the wealth measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 of the consumer determine the external needs of the consumer.

 An interpretation of quality essentially depends on the distance of a consumer'
s non-durable consumption relative to the reference group's consumption
 level (i.e.
 the consumption in the immediate surroundings e.g.
 a locality, a relevant social group, income or owner group of the durable
 goods etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the model we have outlined so far, a consumer can avail consumption
 utility only from durable and non-durable goods.
 That the external needs must depend on the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 of the consumer and her demographic characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 makes sense in empirical terms since consumer must pay maintenance and
 upkeep costs for the long-term durable goods she inherits or purchases
 over time.
 Such costs directly contribute to the non-durable consumption and increase
 the reference level of the consumer needs.
 We denote such cost of needs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 .
 The total cost of needs of a consumer are therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi+\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is measure of the basic needs of a consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the wealth measure (proxied with the value of long-term durable goods
 etc.) and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 is the cost of needs in a particular locality.
 The consumer's consumption of everything else that is not included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 is the consumer's demand for 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
quality (relative to her social reference comprising of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 By owning long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the consumer essentially improves her social-reference and aims to get
 ahead of others by maximising her stock of durable goods relative to the
 reference possession level (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the reference ownership level).
 Another way to look at the consumer's long-term possessions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is that of a commitment which leads to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,A)$
\end_inset

.
 The cost of needs provided by such a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and the expenditure on the relative quality availed by the consumer constitute
 the total expenditure on non-durable consumption by the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The total non-durable consumption for the consumer can thus be written
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu P_{\nu}+\Psi(\rho,A,\psi)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that status is not considered an internal need using our approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the level
 of durable goods ownership she achieves while her internal needs remain
  independent of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both expensive
 durable goods and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class internal needs
 of the consumer).
 Thus at a normative level, the difference between the status of a rich
 and that of a poor family is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 both the families combined with a disparate demand for quality of education
 (driven partly by a disparate price for higher quality).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the price of relative quality relevant in the respective reference group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To motivate a utility function from the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,\nu,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 so far, notice that while the consumer does avail utility within her own
 social reference (specified by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

), a utility function should represent the case where all consumers are
 permitted to rank (compare) each other.
 This is a necessary condition for us to define a common utility function
 applicable to all consumers.
 Since status differences do exist across social reference groups as well
 (e.g.
 individuals in one region compare themselves to those from other regions),
 it follows that a consumer must get some utility from the identity of one's
 social reference in order for there to be a higher (lower) status utility
 obtained with a richer (poorer) identity (e.g.
 region, class etc.).
 If this weren't true - i.e.
 if the consumers could get utility inclusive-of-status only from their
 durable goods value and non-durable consumption - then there could be no
 point of indifference at which a consumer in the poor neighborhood could
 trade places with another in a richer neighborhood.
 For status consumption to have some utility to the consumer, the utility
 function - which is the same for all consumers - must also depend on group
 identity in some way so that a rich consumer with low-positioning can be
 convinced to trade places with someone in the poor neighborhood who has
 a higher (local) social-positioning.
 A common utility function for all consumers and the presence of status-related
 consumption - together permit the small fish in a big pond - so to speak
 - to trade places with a big fish in a small pond.
 Both the i) utility from identity to a reference group and ii) the social
 positioning within a reference group are thus key to the model for status
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider an example to illustrate how two consumers may compete for
 a utility inclusive of status.
 Let there be consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 who live in a poor region (small pond) and a rich region (big pond) respectivel
y so that their non-durable consumption levels are 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{P},c_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The average consumption levels in the regions they reside are 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Let's also assume that the values of their respective long-term durable
 goods bear the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}<A_{R}$
\end_inset

 .
 The same is true for the average asset ownership of the regions 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 ,
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 <
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 If we now consider the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P}<\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 then the cost above needs as quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=\frac{c_{P}-\Psi_{P}}{\psi_{P}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{R}=\frac{c_{R}-\Psi_{R}}{\psi_{R}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the same needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{P}=\psi_{R}$
\end_inset

, if i) the status utility were to be achieved only through durable goods
 and quality, ii) the needs cost the same for both the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and if iii) the utility were a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

, then there may never be any two values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{P},A_{P})\sim(\nu_{R},A_{R})$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 could trade places (ponds) with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 The dependence of utility function on being 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 or being 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 - through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\psi)$
\end_inset

 or directly with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - is necessary for this indifference to exist.
 Such a utility allows 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 to increase her non-durable quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}$
\end_inset

 so that she is indifferent to moving to an urban area even for a higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Assuming that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular sense
 - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for visible consumption
 can be considered separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 The data we observe in the developing countries in sub-Saharan African
 makes the futility assumption less plausible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 For the empirical analyses, probably the most desirable feature of visiblity
 based models is the separability of necessary items from conspicuous items
 - a property that is offered by assuming that the conspicuous items are
 futile (an argument attributed to Veblen).
 To accommodate this assertion, the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 includes items that are commonly understood to have exclusive signaling
 value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 In nascent modern economies of sub-Saharan Africa, however, we find that
 the bandwagon items such as electronics or cars pose obvious empirical
 concerns as they are hardly futile but also serve status needs due to the
 rapid and recent urbanisation in the economies.
 The futility assumption is therefore hardly suitable for a model that is
 cognisant of wealth differences in a rapidly developing economy.
 We therefore use a different approach to status consumption that is based
 on the role that long-term durable goods may play towards status 
\begin_inset Foot

The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor

 While these could be related to snob and bandwagon behaviours (see Corneo
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In an elaboration of the model with a varying cost of relative quality
 across wealth, we also consider the conditions under which the substitution

 We believe that such a model would be more generic for it to be applied
 across other developing economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the utility function we choose for long-term and short-term
 consumer goals does not view status consumption as futile but relates it
 with the attempts to alter a hierarchy of wealth and social identity.
 In this model, status cannot be changed by fulfillment of basic needs but
 is influenced both by long-term possessions and non-durable consumption
 of the consumer in an intertemporal setting.

Hierarchy of Consumer Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The claim that much of our model rests upon is that status is a part of
 the consumer's long-term utility.
 If that weren't the case, the representative consumer in the model would
 have no reason to engage in status-related consumption in any form.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption towards status (otherwise consumers would know of its
 futility), a consumer can achieve a higher status in the model by the acquisiti
on of durable goods (which is assisted with higher income) as well as by
 the status promotion through high-quality non-durable consumption - which
 may enhance social interactions, improve the consumer's self-image and
 is possible to achieve with lower income.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have discussed before, the role of non-durable consumption is two-fold
 in the model - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer
 and second, it achieves high-quality consumption with status-related goals.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity and
 status advantage - since all else being the same, someone have a habit
 of a higher quality is likely to have more status than someone consuming
 a lower quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that the utility from status consumption is a combination of short-ter
m and long-term goals of the consumer - where the short-term goals are fulfilled
 with non-durable consumption and the long-term goals through ownership
 of durable goods.
 The social characteristics such as residence, neighborhood or social class
 could be viewed as cumulative status items that are acquired over multiple
 generations.
 As long as one may assume that the rewards of status are passed on to the
 progeny, this view of social characteristics allows us to view their effect
 on status competitions - which develop within a particular social reference
 group - in the utility model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this temporal hierarchy of goods, some items that bring status are more
 temporary than others.
 Social identity is probably the most permanent of all possessions, while
 ownership of durable goods is more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 In an intertemporal substitution framework, the representative consumer,
 once having addressed her basic needs, would therefore attempt to distribute
 her total (income) outlay into the three variables - needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and permanent ownership 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 does not change in her lifetime, a consumer may only be influenced by the
 characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (and not exercise her choice over it).
 This would mean that all the consumers sharing the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would compete for status with both the durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Empirically, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is simply the total cost of durable goods owned by a consumer (or a household).
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase durable goods and the actual
 purchase of durable goods.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and quality in non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 .
 It follows that when consumers with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 compete with each other for status, their respective 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 also contributes to the utility.
 As social characteristics themselves may only have an epistemological value,
 we assume that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for consumers carries a direct utility proportional proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the overall possession of the social group with the characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - it being the only mechanism of how a consumer derives utility from the
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 As we have already considered the role of

 the wealth which someone having a social characteristics

 is always relative to the social reference level 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$

 Thus the utility from durable goods could be seen as proportional to (
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

 is measure of the group-level durable-goods possession

 We have already defined a control

 By the very definition of the needs, a consumer is meant to select a quality
 control

 only after her basic needs - internal and external - are fulfilled.

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 (in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\end_inset

 for the household - where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 is the long-term durable goods account, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 the social characteristics vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 the basic needs of the consumer.
 A higher value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 would imply a longer distance in value from the needs cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 and a lower future growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (due to constraints on total income).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the model assumes no change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 for the representative consumer does not mean that change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 migration etc.) cannot be understood in terms of the model.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, a consumer who changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (by moving residence or being initiated into an new social group) can be
 seen as facing a new set of needs based on her new environment (and is
 not expected to carry over her habits in from the past environment).
 Therefore the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in non-durable consumption is obtained through a measure of group behaviour
 associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (for example, with the changed costs in the new neighborhood for somebody
 moves in to the neighborhood).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus while the consumer does not choose

 The intertemporal substitution between durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 The choice amongst 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 is not lexicographic - and the consumers with the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 Similarly, the consumers with the same level of

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

\begin_layout Standard
In the empirical analyses, an estimation of costs

 As these are hardly available in a typical consumption dataset, we consider
 an elaboration of the model where

 is observed at the level of groups defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The following subsection first discusses how the variables identified so
 far outline a model for status using a direct utility approach - vis-a-vis
 how the consumer utility depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\frac{c_{t}-\Psi-P_{\psi}\psi}{P_{\nu}}$
\end_inset

.
 We then elaborate a cost-function-based approach that relaxes the limitations
 imposed by the direct utility model and considers 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 observed at a 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-group level.

\begin_layout Subsection
Intertemporal Substitution with an additive direct utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we can assume that the needs of the consumer evolve with a deterministic
 process 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 that is known to the consumer, the substitution would be limited only between
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the direct utility model.
 The assumption is not implausible in a developing economy.
 Given such a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, one could write the combined utility as an additive loglinear utilty in
 the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\upsilon(\rho,A,\nu,\psi) & =k_{A}log(s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A))+k_{\psi}log(\psi)+k_{\nu}log(\nu)+k_{\rho}log(\int_{\rho}A)\label{eq:loglinearutil}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A}+k_{\psi}+k_{\nu}+k_{\rho}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clear limitation of the above model is that the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A,\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 do not represent how the longer-term choices may constrain the short-term
 choices.
 More particularly, the longer-term choices are not only more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

permanent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that guard one's status - they also open possibilities of
 status-signalling through (non-durable) means (i.e.
 less permanent than the durable goods).
 A particular state or characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 of the consumer could constraint or enhance the available choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, much the way 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may constrain 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 For example, having an urban residence opens up the access to a wider market
 for status goods.
 In household-related consumption, similarly, the high prices of housing
 may encourage a consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus
 increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 However, she may improve the overall quality instead of buying a bigger
 house only until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 This implies that the consumers with lower weight for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 may compensate by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 but only as much.
 The effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is both due to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

herd-effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a consequence of the costs that are imposed by the durable goods one possesses
 (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.).
 In the direct utility approach, one can treat such constraints as part
 of the needs cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such constraints on choices that we incorporate in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 are not entirely unrelated to the temporal hierarchy since the constraints
 are essentially the part of commitment implied by the consumer's long-term
 choice.
 Certain costs are necessarily associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 - both of which (along with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 if a consumer could change her characteristics) are long-term commitments
 of the consumer.
 If a consumer chooses to be on a trajectory of higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

, the consumer might have less concerns for status (a choice where life-cycle
 effects have a direct influence).
 Similarly, the ownership of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 also presents a commitment to costs associated with the owned durable good
 - albeit less inescapable than 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

( since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 can be sold in the market or rented out for income).
 The constraints which choices present are thus also part of the temporal
 hierarchy we have outlined in the previous section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving further into the dynamics of the model, we assume that at the end
 of the lifetime of a consumer, the personal wealth of the consumer would
 either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so that the asset
 account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth of some other
 household(s) in the economy.
 Consequently, all consumers in the population differ in the the starting
 amount of their asset accounts as well as the trends of their salaries.
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and her salary after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau-\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

 years of working is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 then at a given age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (the start of working age is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

), she could have purchased some long-term durable-goods from a portion
 of her income - deciding that she does not want more durable goods for
 the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, she could have experienced a change in the life-circumstances
 (needing a bigger or a more expensive house) thus needing more durable
 goods urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Due to minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing countries,
 we assume an environment of negligible credit.
 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only durable goods available in the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider how two consumers that are vastly separated by their
 respective characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1},\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho_{1}}A<\int_{\rho_{2}}A$
\end_inset

 or vice versa) might behave in the direct utility model.
 Recall that the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\rho})$
\end_inset

 means that someone with a group that has a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 an urbanite or someone in a privileged social class) would be believed
 to be rich - even though her real wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 might be at same level with someone with a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 a rural person or someone with an underprivileged social class).
 What permits the decomposition of utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into those through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the social observation (i.e.
 perception) of individuals in terms of identities that are established
 through long-term political or economic events.
 Thus an urbanite or someone with a privileged social class might not need
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth to indicate a higher status when compared with a rural person or
 someone from an under-privileged class who may have the same or even higher
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth.
 Yet since competitions for status matter within one's own social reference
 group and since inference of status is through social observation (perception),
 the individuals from respective social classes would continue to compare
 themselves within the same social reference group as well as those outside
 their social reference group - implying the relevance of both 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 in the common utility function
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While we assume static 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the empirical analyses, the separate effects also accommodate the change
 in demand of quality as one changes their social reference group (e.g.
 by moving residence or establishing social networks outsides one's reference
 group).
 In such a case, the consumer changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has to to adjust to the higher (or lower) 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (due to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\rho)$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The separate effects of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 also explain how the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 could dominate to such an extent that competing with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

 might not matter towards status competitions (we explore the condition
 of this separation in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

With the direct utility function specified in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 we can now specify a simple intertemporal substitution framework where
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t},\nu_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 are the respective measures for needs, quality and durable goods in the

 If the consumer faced only two periods, then the utilities to be maximised
 in the two periods would be described as
\end_layout

\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1},\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 are consumption on quality in periods 1 and 2 respectively while 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0},A_{1}$

 are value of durable goods at start of the periods 1 and 2.
 The constraints 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\psi}+k_{\rho}+k_{\nu,i}+k_{A,i}=1$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In equilibrium, we consider that the utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 The consumer choice is therefore not exercised for

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

This is not far-fetched in a developing economy.
 However, outside the developing economy contexts, if needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 expansion of family) were to be treated as part of the consumer choice,
 we may consider that an individual could delay or suspend the expansion
 of family in order to fulfill a target 
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 The basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and the utility one gets from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 for a rich and poor individual may be the same but the costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\rho)$
\end_inset

 the two may face depends both on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 When faced with imminent expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, therefore the consumer could discourage potential changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 so as to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 (by keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

.
 This effect is indeed ignored with the assumption of a predetermined 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 being predetermined for every consumer in the economy implies that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 is nearly constant with time, the consumer exercises her choice only by
 distributing income between 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{1},A_{1}-m(\int_{\rho_{1}}A))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{2},A_{2}-m(\int_{\rho_{2}}A))$
\end_inset

 in a two-period model.
 The only true substitution - in other words - is between 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

\begin_layout Standard
In a typical solution of the intertemporal problem, the wealth constraint
 for the optimisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $U=u_{0}+u_{1}$
\end_inset

 would consider the final 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 all of the consumer's durable goods being liquidated and consumed in the
 last period) and the discounting rate based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - but in our case, we prefer to track the change in asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 at every period i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 (as we observe ownership of durable goods rather than wealth).
 Using a dynamic optimisation formulation, we write the following constraints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
J_{1}\equiv x_{1}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{1},A_{1})=(P_{\nu,1}\psi_{1})\nu_{1}+\Delta_{1}P_{A,1}\nonumber \\
J_{2}\equiv x_{2}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{2},A_{2})=(P_{\nu,2}\psi_{2})\nu_{2}+\Delta_{2}P_{A,2}\label{eq:J_constraints}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A,i}$
\end_inset

 is the price of durable-goods in period 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu,i}$
\end_inset

 represents the price non-durable quality respectively (not associated with
 a particular item with quality overall).
 The above means that the consumer may consume quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{3...}$
\end_inset

 being undefined) in the periods 1 and 2 while she bears the cost of the
 needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\rho,\psi_{1},A_{1}),\Psi(\rho,\psi_{2},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 (in periods 1 and 2 respectively).
 She may save for growth to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}=A_{0}+P_{A,1}\Delta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}=A_{1}+P_{A,2}\Delta_{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of consuming all her outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu_{t}\psi_{t}+\Psi_{t}(\psi_{t},A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 she can spend all of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}$
\end_inset

 (respectively) or save some of it towards 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If we observe the states of the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0},A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

, consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\{c_{1},c_{2}\},$
\end_inset

 cost of necessities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2}\}$
\end_inset

, the prices of quality units (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu,t}$
\end_inset

) and that of durable goods (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A,t}$
\end_inset

), then we can solve for the parameters that govern the utility function
 additive over time i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we assume that the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 grow with a fixed deterministic process 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

, the outlay to be distributed in expenditure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t},A_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in\{1,2\}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{t}=x_{t}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{t},A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:J_constraints"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 To motivate the dynamic programming approach to this solution, consider
 first what consumer's choices would be in a one-period consumption.
 Here, she could either spend her outlay as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{_{1}}=\nu_{1}\psi_{1}+\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or keep the minimum consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0,c_{1}=\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

) in the period and end up with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, then the first-order conditions would provide us the optimal condition
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Let this utility be 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*},A_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 To extend this to two periods with dynamic optimisation one can exploit
 the fact that a consumer independently optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 would always obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are unbounded functions 
\begin_inset Formula $max(u_{1}+u_{2})\le max(u_{1})+max(u_{2})=u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is only a tool to formulate the dynamic optimisation approach - using which
 the value of utility is to be optimised over her life period in a 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

-period model (
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 being the age of the consumer).
 Thus in the optimisation of utility function in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:twoperiodoptim"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the consumer must optimise both 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 in periods 1 and 2 respectively.

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have put no restrictions on 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu,1}$

\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu,2}$

\begin_inset Formula $k_{A,1},k_{A,2})$
\end_inset

 (other than that they should add to unity in every period).
 If we add some structure to the consumer choice by introducing life-cycle
 effects with a form of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu},k_{A}$
\end_inset

 that depends on the age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of the consumer - so the same level of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 offers less utility to the consumer as shes age (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 declines with age) and that the same level of long-term durable goods has
 higher utility later in life (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A}$
\end_inset

 increases with age).
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu},k_{A}$
\end_inset

 could be assumed to be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $n(\tau)$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau)$

 of the consumer - a sensitivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau,A)$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 could be considered.
 In economies that are segregated based on long-term durable goods that
 are largely intergenerational (and thus long-term enough for their utility
 to not change over time), the sensitivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau,A)$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 may be very little and could allow us to use a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

The above solution highlights how a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may be influenced by social charactersitics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and life-cycle effects.
 An obvious implication is that higher needs suppress the total outlay for
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Also evident is that in absolute terms, the richer consumers would find
 it more expensive to indicate wealth to their surrounding.
 The equivalent argument applies for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Assumed an appropriate form for 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A,t}$
\end_inset

 would show that the consumer would increase her ownership of durable goods
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A,t}$
\end_inset

 increases with time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are however three major limitations to such an approach.
 First is that using a loglinear utility, the price derivatives of the cost-func
tion need to be the same for both subsistence and bliss (see Appendix for
 details).
 Second, the issue of constraints imposed by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 - which we've discussed above - is not sufficiently addressed with the
 additive function.
 The third and probably the most critical limitation is that we have assumed
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 to be uniform for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Since the price of relative quality of non-durable consumption in excess
 of needs (relevant for status consumption) is likely to depend on long-term
 characteristics e.g.
 wealth measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 or characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 such as residence or social class in an economy, the empirical utility
 of the model is limited.

\begin_layout Standard
There are many reasons why the cost of relative quality could differ significant
ly across regions.
 One such instance is the unavailability of certain high-quality items in
 the relatively deprived regions of an economy.
 The heterogeneity of prices may be starker in a developing country where
 there are severe disparities amidst the consumer markets in urban and rural
 areas (due to structural issues such as high transportation costs, under-develo
ped markets or lack of centralised incentives).
 The constraints on quality of non-durable consumption imposed by long-term
 durable goods also cause a heterogeneity in prices of relative quality.
 For example, the consumption of exotic desserts or meats cannot improve
 quality of one's food until one owns a refrigerator.
 Someone with no access to the refrigerator thus faces a different relative-qual
ity price for food than from someone who own a refrigerator.
 Thus substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is subject to constraints.
 The additive utility with a uniform 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 does not represent such constraints as it allows the consumer to readily
 substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\nu$
\end_inset

.
 To better represent the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{A,\nu\}$
\end_inset

, we look further into how prices of relative-quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 could vary for a consumer with characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

Substitution with quality under a hierarchy of wealth levels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the choice between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is not lexicographic, the relevance of reference groups and constraint
 on quality implies that it does not amount to much substitution either.
  To develop the specific conditions for this substitution, we detail the
 dependence of the price of relative quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 on the wealth-level 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 As we have argued before, the price of relative quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 depends on the possessions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and the reference group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - which we viewed as clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) in two ways.
 First is the direct dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 the cost of maintaining the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

).
 Second dependence is due to the constraints on the quality due to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is merely a cluster of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, a consumer may not compete for status using 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 if the differences in their 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 levels (the difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band of a consumer and the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band just above hers) are too wide apart.
 Such a difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda=\int_{\rho_{1}}A-\int_{\rho_{2}}A$
\end_inset

 for levels 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho_{1}}A>>\int_{\rho_{2}}A$
\end_inset

 would limit consumption on quality for the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consequence of this particular limitation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is that the substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\{A,\rho\}$
\end_inset

 can only occur within certain bounds of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 When wide differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 cannot be overcome with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 , the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 limit the consumers' focus outside their own reference group.
 This is an important claim for our model.
 While unexpressed differences in wealth may be the very cause of status
 consumption, it is also true that extremely wide differences in wealth
 or durable goods would segregate participation in status competitions across
 the groups of consumers having disparate levels of wealth.
 This is particularly true in severely unequal societies of the developing
 economies.
 Even in the more general setting, the conditions of higher cohesion (e.g.
 urban life ) that may coalesce various social groups (which would have
 had their own reference groups if not for the social cohesion brought about
 through economic changes) do not necessarily end the segmentation of status
 consumption based on wealth differences.
 For as long as wealth matters towards status and the consumers of disparate
 wealth levels participate in a common status competition, one can be assured
 that the higher wealth differences would segregate the status competitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical observations verify that the status items are tied to a specific
 wealth levels - e.g.
 better food and beverages tend to indicate status at low wealth levels,
 luxury accessories at medium wealth levels and exclusive possessions (expensive
 watches, private jet access) at higher levels of wealth.
 There is evidence to the observation that the consumers with varied wealth-leve
ls often compete only with those in their immediate neighborhood(see Chai
 et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ChaiKaus2019"

\end_inset

).
 Status competitions thrive because we are consciously averse to committing
 ourselves to the implications of a long-term wealth order.
 A psychological need to maintain a certain self-image and dismiss the role
 of known wealth differences to our near future necessitates the status
 consumption for all wealth-levels.
 Thus while the differences in wealth drive the consumption of quality,
 the quality itself is likely to be segregated based on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-levels.
 The status item from someone else's 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band may not be of much value to oneself - a luxury watch may be worth
 only its sale value to someone who toils the earth for food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate how quality may be tied to differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-levels (
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

) more quantiatively, let's look at a simple example where consumers 1 and
 2 with wealth measures 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 compete for status.
 Given that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

, let's also assume at first that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=0$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 they are individuals with the same basic needs and there are no new durable
 goods to be purchased).
 With the same set of basic needs, the disposable income would be higher
 for consumer 1 since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}-\Psi(A_{1})>x_{2}-\Psi(A_{2})$
\end_inset

 (thus possibly
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}>\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 So while as such consumer 2 has higher status 1 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

, the consumer 1 might have a higher status than consumer 2 in the competition
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{x-\Psi(A_{1})}{P_{\nu}},A_{1})=u(\frac{x-\Psi(A_{2})}{P_{\nu}},A_{2})$

 for the consumers 1 and 2 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}<A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the same utility cannot be obtained with disparate levels
 of durable goods possession - as it would imply the unlikely observation
 that the asset-poor consumer is indifferent to being asset-rich.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is possible however, that the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}-A_{1}$
\end_inset

 is so high than consumer 2 may never have a status higher than consumer
 1 i.e there may be a critical difference in wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

 between the consumers 1 and 2 so that any difference in wealth for the
 poorer consumer 1 beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

 would be insurmountable with quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu'$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda=A_{2}-A_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin{alignat*}{1}
\forall\Lambda & <\Lambda_{0}:\{\forall\nu'\ u(\nu',A_{1})\le u(0,A_{2})\}

\end_inset

The market for status through quality thus exists for wealth differences
 within 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If one could view 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 as the price of items that indicate status through quality, their demand
 would be lower when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda>\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 when there is no market for status through quality.
 Put differently, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 drops sharply beyond the critical value 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

 in the two-consumer world.
 If we were to permit 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta>0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the purchase of durable goods in the example, it would make sense for both
 the consumers to divert all outlay to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 outside of this 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 It follows that the consumption of quality is optimal only within the range
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda\le\Lambda_{0}$

 In a simple model with

 the quality required to be ahead of the higher 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$

 This would imply that the value of

Now that we have associated

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 in more detail.
 Let's consider a different example with two consumers where one owns a
 private jet while the other doesn't.
 Here, not having a private jet 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 could be substituted with first-class air-travel 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 up to a certain level of wealth (bliss), but it would become the part of
 the necessity 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

 as one's wealth grows - until a certain point arrives where a private jet
 must be owned.
 The first-class air-travel forms the part of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 only for someone in a lower band to compete with somebody in the private-jet-ba

 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 has a necessary break due to

 We refer to this 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

-break as the

which implies that a certain

 The segmentation in demand for quality due to the differences in wealth

 If we can assume that

 In a society that is more equal in terms of long-term wealth, therefore,
 the demand for relative quality might be more than one where wider differences

 Thus the cost-function

A useful intuition for the PIGLOG cost-functions (see Deaton

Properties of Substitution in Relative Quality

In the direct utility problem a consumer optimises her direct-utility for
 a given period comprising of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$

\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 (whose path is predetermined) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

\begin_inset Formula $A$

 Equivalently, the consumer minimises her costs to obtain a certain

 for a given structure of the price of relative quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\rho$

 While in the earlier direct utility formulation, we have detailed how the
 two consumers would maximise their own utility using of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for a given set of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

\end_inset

, the latter cost-function formulation with the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band-varying 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 allows us to consider the optimisation of utility with respect to the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band as a reference point.
 By making 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 dependent on a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, we effectively constrain the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 to a particular 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible objection to this latter formulation could be that there is no
 real competition between the wealthy and non-wealthy - as they are trivially
 far apart from one another in status.
 That can never be entirely true since there may always be a status competition
 between close-enough wealth differences.
 Also, such a competition is not fundamentally unlike the optimisation of
 consumer utilities in the presence of disparate consumer budgets.
 Thus as long as one may assume that every consumer 
\shape italic
- ceteris paribus 
\shape default
- prefers a higher wealth-level than her own and participates in the competition
 for one's perceived status, the consumer utility framework can be appropriately
 used to understand status consumption.
 Following are some key assumptions that lead to the properties of this
 model that we later use in our empirical analysis.

, the identification of

-groups relevant to status consumption is essentially an empirical concern.
 For example, the groups based on region or social class are easier justified
 than a group based on education or native-language.
 If one were to consider overlapping characteristics

- e.g.
 education, income, then the classification 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 would ensure mutually exclusive

 For example, to consider groups of graduates and non-graduates in a population
 of high-income and low-income individuals, we can consider the tuples of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{educ,inc\}$

\begin_inset Formula $educ,inc$

\begin_layout Description
Assumption 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The subsistence level of needs does not  include ownership of long-term
 goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define subsistence level as the cost of the minimum needs basket for
 the consumer i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 denotes the price of the basket per head evaluated locally and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the number of family units.
 In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, we use a minimum needs basket comprising
 of food, energy, transport and household items categories.
 As a significant population in the developing countries survives on mere
 subsistence, the assumption that the basic needs of the consumer (i.e.
 the subsistence level) do not  include ownership of long-term goods is
 hardly far-fetched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exclusion of durable goods from subsistence and the view of relative-quality
 as non-durable consumption in excess of one's needs together imply that
 the price of long-term durable goods cannot vary with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the way 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 does.
 This is because there is no sense of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 durable goods if the basic needs of the consumer do not include owning
 long-term durable goods.
 Once again, this does not pose an empirical issue in the developing countries
 where the ownership of long-term durable goods such as land or housing
 is limited to a small proportion of the population.

\begin_layout Description
Assumption 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The separation condition does not apply to the groups participating in status

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 An important feature of the direct utility model had been the substitution
 between a higher status-group and the possession of durable goods in a
 lower status group.
 While the rich live in a better neighborhood and indicate higher status
 as a group - someone not so rich amongst the rich might get more bliss
 by staying in a poorer neighborhood if she prefers to have a higher relative
 income with respect to her reference group.
 As we detail in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Substitution-with-quality"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 however, such a substitution is also subject to a separation condition.
 If the groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

 have disparate levels of needs, then all consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in$
\end_inset

group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

 would have a futile status consumption (in a competition with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

-group) as there is no amount of relative quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 or durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that can can overcome the effect of group level wealth differences.
 Under these conditions of a perfect separation, 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in$
\end_inset

group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

 cannot move to the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

 and enjoy a lower set of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 or a more favourable 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 The status competitions would thus only exist if the separation condition
 is not met for groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical data on usage of the long-term goods e.g.
 electricity bills for the electrical equipment are subject to seasonality
 and measurement errors.
 As we cannot reliably estimate the maintenance-costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 associated with owned set of goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 at an individual consumer's level, we are limited to using 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

-level implies necessarily that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 must also be observed at the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 -level in the empirical analysis.
 This is because for every consumer (due to the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) we have 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 are of commodities rather than goods (we consider quality of food, quality
 of entertainment etc.
 and associated prices with it rather than the items).
 The purchase prices of the items - that may be observed directly, recorded
 or recalled in the survey - are therefore not required for an estimation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 at the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-group level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of particular interest is the variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 due to the unavailability of items of higher quality.
 If higher quality items are not available in a given region, for example,
 the overall (absolute) quality in non-durable consumption available to
 the consumers in the region would be lower.
 It is worth emphasising that absolute quality comprises both of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 If the consumers within a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 avail high quality due to availability of higher quality items, it is not
 automatically implied that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is higher for the consumer where there are more high quality items.
 As the price of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quality, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is associated with a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band and only measures the price of consumption on quality conditioned
 on the durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 owned by the consumer (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu=\frac{c_{t}-\Psi-P_{\psi}\psi}{\psi}$
\end_inset

 ).
 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu=\frac{c_{t}-\Psi-P_{\psi}\psi}{\psi}$
\end_inset

 is an estimate of the consumption on quality in the group which the consumer
 belongs to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirically, it is the permanent ownership instances of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in the respective regions that determine higher or lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 in the respective group and the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in the group.
 Through residence in the region with high quality items, the consumer would
 typically raise her minimum level of needs (thus reducing the income outlay
 towards quality i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu$
\end_inset

 - responding to conditions in her own 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-group)

The pseudo-panel approach used in our empirical analysis where

 Therefore, as the representative consumer purchases more durable goods,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 - which may also contribute to overall / absolute quality - changes with
 that of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-group she belongs to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate this with an example, consider two consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 so that the consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 possesses several electrical appliances while consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 does not.
 As such 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 is likely to have a higher quality of consumption.
 This is indicated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 would necessarily have higher electricity bills than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 While the consumption of more energy itself does not amount to availing
 higher quality, it helps account for quality that is accompanied by having
 more durable goods.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 were to compete for status, there must be non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 that would permit 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 to get closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 in status ranking (i.e.
 the separation condition does not apply).
 The consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu$
\end_inset

 is the part of the relative quality and allows 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 to compete with each other.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 merely provides a way for us to standardise the competition with quality
 by allowing us to compare non-durable consumption from consumers having
 more durable goods with that from those who don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with the direct utility approach, we use the assumption that the consumers
 are on a predetermined path of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
 Thus in the PIGLOG specification, a consumer minimises costs for a given
 utility by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu,\Delta A)$
\end_inset

 under relative-quality prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\rho)$
\end_inset

 and the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 given her 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 (see Equation

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$

\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The other less straightforward option - which does not require the consumer
 to be on a predetermined path of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 - would have been to view subsistence costs 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 (but not 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu})$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p)$
\end_inset

 remain a function of both 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 we rewrite the consumer budget as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
x_{t} & \equiv\Delta_{t}+c_{t}-\Psi(A_{t})-P_{\psi}\psi_{t}=\Delta_{t}+P_{\nu}\psi_{t}\nu_{t}\label{eq:x_t_definition}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subsistence costs therefore correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 (a zero outlay means the subsistence level expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Delta_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 due to the Assumption 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of this specification, the higher budget could either be spent
 on relative quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\nu$
\end_inset

 or more long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 As the consumer acquires more durable goods her outlay could fall if the
 costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 rise.
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 by assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 must depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-levels and that the life-cycle effects are already part of the model since
 the effective price of quality increases with increase in needs (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\psi$
\end_inset

).
 The cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,P_{\nu},\Psi,A)$
\end_inset

 is defined for i) a given distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and ii) the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 - both of which 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 must depend on.
 The changes in
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 across 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho/A$
\end_inset

 motivate a quantile regression for the demand for quality.
 Before we discuss the empirical application of the model in the subsequent
 sections, the we enlist a few properties of the model that we use for empirical
 analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Property 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Higher subsistence costs for a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would suppress consumption on quality for the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a straightforward implication given the definition of the outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Higher subsistence prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 for a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 have the same effect as that of reducing the disposable outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 (relevant for only quality) for that particular 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Of two consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-groups facing different subsistence costs, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-group having the higher subsistence costs would have lower outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards status consumption.
 It also matters whether the two 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-groups survive closer to subsistence.
 For a consumer closer to the subsistence level, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 would be low and a rise in subsistence costs would mean a minimal outlay
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 towards relative quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, a consumer further from subsistence i.e.
 with an higher outlay higher than subsistence level may substitute between
 owning more durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and relative quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 more comfortably.
 The rise in subsistence prices for such a consumer lowers her budget for
 quality but not as much compared to a consumer who survives closer to subsisten
ce levels.
 That lowering the outlay at higher levels of the outlay does not drop the
 bliss (utility) as sharply as closer to the subsistence is evident from
 the shape of the PIGLOG curve as well (see Appendix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also evident that when subsistence costs 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 are not high for any particular 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 they are same for all consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-groups, then the expenditure on relative quality is subject only to the
 price of relative quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\rho)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Property 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Status competitions are spurred as subsistence becomes cheaper and bliss
 becomes expensive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of this claim is proven trivially.
 Subsistence becoming cheaper makes sure that more consumers participate
 in the status consumption.
 With the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x_t_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we can see that rise in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
reduce the outlay for quality as well as permanent goods and thus discourage
 status competition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we explain the spurring of status competitions in response to higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

, notice an asymmetry in the consumption at subsistence and bliss levels.
 More particularly, while survival may not be possible below subsistence,
 there is virtually no upper limit to the level of wealth and quality that
 can provide more bliss (even if there are diminishing returns to bliss
 from relative quality and permanent ownership).
 The acquisition of durable goods and provision of higher quality can continue
 unabated as income levels rise - but they cannot fall below subsistence.
 This asymmetry and the association of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band has implications for the demand for status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice first that by an intensification of status competitions we mean either
 or both of the purchases in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 not merely consumption of quality to compete with a consumer having higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ).
 Therefore the model must explain how price-rises in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) could affect the demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

).
 For the purposes of this discussion, we ignore the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - as it is observed as a cluster of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Thus status consumption is subject to a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and the changes in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 As we have seen a separation condition may apply i.e.
 the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 could be so far apart that and there is no need for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 status competition.
 The significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is only with respect to a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is subject to the demand from consumers in a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band, then consumers within the same 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band competing for quality (their needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 being the same) would drive the price for quality items 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The separation implies necessarily that the substitution between permanent-owne
rship and quality is not as if every individual has a fixed demand for quality
 which she adjusts as the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 rise and fall.
 Instead, when 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is driven by finite-sized 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band alone, then a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may create more competition for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

-goods leading to a rise in the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (and in turn narrowing the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Such a change would trickle down to the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands since the 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for the immediately lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would get more crowded because of the rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - a ripple effect that would may continue to the lowest 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The rise of prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 thus raises the price of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
 Note that the rise of prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 does not affect the higher 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

-band - so that it only limits the competition for the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band itself (as there are fewer consumers with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 to compete with them).
 On the other hand, the separation condition between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 also implies that too much of a drop in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would make the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 feasible.
 More specifically, if the rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is so much that a redistribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (wealth) ensues i.e.
 the consumers may sell their 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and move to the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 Equivalently, when there is a small drop in price of

\begin_layout Standard
To consider the demand for

\end_inset

 through introduction of new quality goods (newer technology, products etc.)
 could affect the prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Once again the price of relative-quality increases the status of only a
 certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band.
 As a newer item is introduced, all other items might not have as much value
 towards status any more and the new item - having a higher price - would
 raise the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 slightly.
 If the respective 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands are intact, the price of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would drop as 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 rises due to a new item.
 Here, since quality is always tied to a certain

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$

 Except through the budget-squeeze, the rise in

 The association of

amounts to the intensification of status competitions.
 Specifically, as small rises of

 move together, a rise in prices of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 for consumer above subsistence does little to end the need for status competiti

 Without changes that transform the asset hierarchies, we can argue that
 bliss becoming more expensive amounts to more intense status competition.

\begin_layout Description
Property 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The separation based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is more likely at subsistence than at bliss levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We bring back the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in the separation condition again in the discussion of this property.
 To recap, a separation can exist based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 as well if 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho_{R}}A>>\int_{\rho_{P}}A$
\end_inset

 for groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{P},\rho_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The two consumers in groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{R}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{P}$
\end_inset

 therefore may never trade places with each other if a 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-separation applies.
 In the absence of this condition, on the other hand,  a substitution between
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A,\nu$
\end_inset

) would be possible since the consumers having different 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 may get the same utility (
\begin_inset Formula $\exists A_{P}|\upsilon(\cdot,A_{P},\rho_{P})=\upsilon(\cdot,0,\rho_{R})$
\end_inset

) .
 As we have discussed with the Property 1, the indifference (or substitution)
 is more likely if the consumer wealth is high enough so that changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is of negligible impact to the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 i .e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{R},\rho_{P}$
\end_inset

 are as far as from subsistence level as possible ( equivalently, a consumer
 would not gain much utility by changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 e.g.
 by moving residence or joining another social network when she is quite
 poor ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider - for example - a group with a higher education than the other
 group - where both groups face different bliss costs while the subsistence
 costs are not sensitive to being educated.
 The status competitions may thrive between the two 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-groups when there is no separation based on education (i.e.
 being educated could be substituted with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

).
 On other hand, if those who are educated also face lower subsistence costs
 than others (e.g.
 due to the education being provided through a central authority which also
 covers expenses etc.), then the non-educated necessarily have a lower outlay
 for relative quality and a separation condition is implied.
 Thus the less-educated group may not have a reason to compare itself with
 the educated-group.
 In empirical terms, it could be said that a steep or discrete change in
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(\rho)$
\end_inset

 represents a strong separation - i.e.
 less substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\nu$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard

There may be for example a non-linearity of choice at play around the subsistenc
e levels i.e.
 the consumers may be particularly resigned to the idea of improving quality/per
manent-ownership or participating in status competitions closer to subsistence
 levels.
 In other words, the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-levels could appear starker to the consumer and contribute the separation
 based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 closer to subsistence levels (see Karelis

\end_layout

\end_inset

 pricess vary significantly across clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or identified 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-groups in an economy or not.
 In the subsequent sections, we present an estimation of the model using
 the dependence of budget ratios 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu},w_{A}$
\end_inset

 (which are equivalent to the price-sensitivities of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(c(u,\textbf{p}))$

\end_inset

 and the demographic characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (which let us identify clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ).
 The above mentioned properties of the model motivate our interpretation
 of the results - which we use to explain the variation in permanent ownership
 and quality consumption across the population of consumers.
 We believe that such a variation could provide a more relevant view of
 status consumption in the developing economies  than that of the assumed
 rush for visible goods.

Cost of Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each wave of the survey, we use both the consumption diary of food items
 and the recall diary of non-food items to compute the cost of needs of
 the consumer - summing up the expenditure on the items that are considered
 necessities.
 The necessities are gathered from the four categories of consumption identified
 in the LSMS data - food, household, energy and transport.
 The cost of basic needs is therefore simply the cost of minimal requirements
 in every category.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this interpretation of basic (internal) needs, we rely on the market-prices
 available in the survey for each locality.
 For example, under food category, we obtain the minimum requires for carbohydra
tes, fat, protein and fruits-vegetables categories and the prices of the
 cheapest item in each sub-category of food.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - is calculated at the level using the prices of the
 items recorded in the survey (the prices are recorded at the district level
 as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket is a diet of
 cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - these being the cheapest items
 in most regions.
 The cost of the basket thus calculated is much higher in the urban areas
 than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 This cost of baskset is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the basic cost of needs per household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LamSmith2012Kerosene"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and https://energypedia.info/ for data on typical energy usage in the developing
 countries).
 For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 The running costs of the house - depending on whether it's owned or rented
 are included in the cost of basic needs as well.
 Under transport category, the public-transport costs and petrol consumption
 costs (which in turn depend on whether a consumer owns a motor-bike or
 a car) are considered not as part of basic needs but as part of the costs
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

Quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In empirical terms, our notion of quality as consumption in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of needs is a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 For food commodities, standardising a set of needs general across the populatio
n is relatively easy - as the cost of needs in food would simply be the
 cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area for the total number
 of households in the family.
 But when the context of consumption is not limited to food and employment,
 the ideas of health and autonomy (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and Doyal-Gough

) require some justification based on the consumer's environment.
 In the particular context of Tanzania, the differences between urban or
 rural settings drive our consideration of subsistence costs 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

.

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-groups used for analyses are the urban and rural residence in every region
 of Tanzania.
 Using this 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

-level aggregation, the quality chosen by the consumer is simply the needs-adust
ed difference between her reported non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi+P_{\psi}\psi$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 The aggregation also minimises possible measurement errors with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 due to seasonality or completeness of data.
 Consider if there were severe measurement error 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon'$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi'$

In such a case, the measurement errors with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

 directly influence the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu P_{\nu}$

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice however that relying only on the total costs associated with a commodity
 (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality or 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
cannot differentiate between the consumption of a higher quantity and of
 a higher quality as such.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 for a commodity priced 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$
\end_inset

, then our quality metric for the consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

).
 That said, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity
 are available in the region or not, it is possible to draw conclusions
 about over-consumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity (more so when a pseudo-panel analysis
 is used).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This is unavoidable unless we have a detailed time-series for the usage
 of every individual.
 A consumer not having reported expenditure on clothing or transportation
 in the recorded week of the survey, doesn't mean that the consumer would
 not have had clothing needs throughout the year.
 The cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 - which acts as the reference point for the notion of quality - is therefore
 essentially an aggregate-concern and the measurement of the needs of the
 consumer at an individual level is equivalent to measuring quality consumed
 at an individual level.
 Notice that the cost of internal needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 of the household - i.e.
 the product of the number of units in the family and observed price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 - is less susceptible to measurement errors due to the availability of
 market prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 at the district level and the detailed record of the members of the households
 (and their cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - which we use to measure the needs of the household).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that all costs incurred due to maintenance, usage and upkeep of the
 long-term durable goods are included in the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and would thus bear a higher non-durable
 consumption level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

(while the consumer that does not own any electrical goods would not have
 the same non-durable consumption).
 Revisiting the earlier example, consider a consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 with a refrigerator and another consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 without a refrigerator who both have the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and the same set of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 .
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{E_{L}}<\Psi_{E_{H}}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{E_{L}}>c_{t}-\Psi_{E_{H}}$
\end_inset

) .
 But does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 While the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity groups
 (over energy or durable goods for example).
 Strictly speaking, the quality in one commodity can be hardly substituted
 with the quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality is meaningful only as long as a total cost
 of basic needs level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is considered.
 The notion of excess - subject to such a level - is thus the only a way
 to assess overall quality in non-durable consumption.
 If having a refrigerator is not considered a basic need, we can say nothing
 more than that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{H}$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 By avoiding counting maintenance costs under 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, we merely maintain the interpretation that quality needs to be understood
 from a reference point of needs 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is possible that ownership of some durable goods generates some rental
 income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, such income would be considered an additional stream of income rather
 than a reduction in the costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the classification of long-term durable goods is based on intergenerationa
l transfers i.e.
 an item is included in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and thus its cost of maintenance are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) only if it can be passed on through generations.
 The durable goods that cannot be passed through generations are thus not
 considered long-term and excluded from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 An empirical criterion for consideration of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is also that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 should increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (there are no assets that can be maintained without any costs).
 This criterion avoids an assets-interpretation of certain social characteristic
s such as education or club-membership - which may be acquired over a life-time,
 require some investment (fees for education or club membership) and even
 have a definite value in the market (e.g.
 employment market).
 We prevent viewing personal characteristics (e.g.
 education) as assets by limiting the constituents of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs may change over the period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) can be significantly different from the cost reported in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 This may simply be because of a different member of the same household
 providing the estimate in the two different years.
 The problem gets worsened due to two further factors.
 First, that the data we have from the three waves are not panel-data in
 the true sense since the household visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is likely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 but very unlikely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-2$
\end_inset

.
 Second, a significant number of households are split in multiple households
 - thus permitting more measurement errors as the new household members
 recall the cost of owned items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to above issues with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

, we use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods (i.e.
 the mtm average) as it is not recalled from consumer's memory but instead
 reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time - an
 issue that we can handle by averaging over 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 An issue that still remains is that the mtm average of the durable goods
 (like the cost of the durable good) is a value averaged over the number
 of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 (for item 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

) owned by consumer.
 Therefore, the cost incurred by the purchase of a new durable goods in
 the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 we're interested in i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 - also depends on the field 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 indicating the number of durable goods (for each good 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

).
 To minimise measurement errors, we record a durable good purchase as part
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 when a significant difference in the number of durable goods over the successiv
e years is observed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The split households no longer pose the same measurement error concenrs
 when using the average mtms 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 and treating a split household as the terminal state of the parent household.
 Whenever the household is split in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, we do not consider the parent household in the computation of the durable
 good differences from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the durable good net-differences include a household only if it has
 not split in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presence of split households also provides us an opportunity to verify
 the classification of durable goods - since the goods that can be transferred
 over generations can be verified as being split across the resultant households
 after the split.
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data, we consider any durable good more expensive
 than bed as eligible to be transferred to the next generation.
 The durable goods in the survey that are not life-long durable goods e.g.
 mobile phones, dish-tv etc.
 are not considered in the net-durable good changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{\tau+1}=A_{\tau+1}-A_{\tau}$

For robustness tests to our conclusions, we attempt to both

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

smoothen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the data on durable goods changes.
 The sharpening of the data is merely the classification of new durable
 goods purchased into a coarse categories rather than an aggregate of all
 durable goods.
 This is insightful in its own right as it illustrates the distribution
 of functional durable goods (electric, agricultural etc.) in the consumer
 population.
 We find that grouping the durable goods into agricultural electronic, electric
 and livestock categories accentuates the differences across rural and urban
 regions.
 Since our asset-groups are based on urban/rural residence, these differences
 are accounted for in the analyses through 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The finer view of asset ownership data validates the conclusion obtained
 by considering the cost of assets and urban-rural classification (as part
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).

The smoothening of the data is turning off the effect of depreciation in
 the durable good difference calculation.
 The need for a test after smoothening the data arises due to possible measureme
nt errors that may remain in the recording of the mtm-average.
 The three LSMS waves we have considered have been conducted in way that
 a household visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is quite likely to have visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 but very unlikely to have been visited in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t-2$
\end_inset

.
 Thus as we calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 over the period of two years, it is possible either that the household
 interviewee estimates the change in the mtm differently in the two years
 or that the local market conditions have changed in the region (it is also
 possible that a different member of the same household provides a different
 estimate in the two years).
 We smoothen the asset ownership data by separating the effect of such factors
 by consider one year's prices alone.
 For example, with a durable good 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 whose value is 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the reported average mtm of the durable good at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of durable goods the household possesses), we use the
 mtm-average estimate (price) at either from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t+1}=A_{t+1}-A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore either 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t+1}=P_{a,t}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 ( or 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t+1}=P_{a,t+1}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 ) instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t+1}=n_{a,t+1}P_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t}P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 It is evident that former is less affected by the measurement error than
 the latter

Due to the sparsity of the survey, the data on asset-ownership may not be
 available at the district-level - i.e.
 no consumers may have the price for a certain good in a particular region
 in both the yeas.
 Such problems are remedied with the consideration of

 The problem is also avoided if we use the price

Before we discuss these results, notice that the claim 2 can be evaluated
 in the data in the two different periods 2010-2012 and 2012-2014.
 The subsistence (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi,t}\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) is different in these years and it can also vary across the population
 e.g.
 in urban and rural areas.
 The Claim 2 says that when subsistence level costs increases but needs
 stay the same the status consumption should decline (i.e.
 no higher quality and no more durable goods).
 On the other hand, when subsistence becomes cheaper the status consumption
 should increase (more durable goods and/or higher quality).
 This should also be seen in the cross-section (a claim that Claim 2 does
 not encompass but the model also implies is that when the needs themselves
 increase as consumers move to urban areas or acquire more durable goods,
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{nu}nu$
\end_inset

 would also reduce).
 The subsistence level costs amount to 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi,t}\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a function of the age of the individual and is calculated at the local
 level 
\series bold
DISTRICT/REGION/URBAN?
\series default
 - region and urban could be the same).
 The status consumption is a combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}=\frac{c_{t}-\Psi_{t}}{\psi_{t}}$
\end_inset

 - which are to be calculated at the local level as well.
 
\bar under
region X {urban,rural} seems the right way.
 The needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 are also aggregated at the needs cost level - we're interested in the how
 an urban consumer responds to high needs vs rural consumer to same needs.
 This is a cross section concern which can be visited first.

Considering the cross-sectional concern
\bar default

\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$

 increases for the population.
 The elasticity of 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\Delta A}$
\end_inset

 with respect to price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$

 is one way to do it but since we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 is predetermined for the consumer, the derivatives we cannot set
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\psi}\equiv\frac{\partial c(u,\textbf{p})}{\partial P_{\psi}}$

\end_inset

 against 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log(J)$
\end_inset

 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is pre-determined and the interpretation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p})}{\partial P_{\psi}}$
\end_inset

 must be arrived at through 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial J}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$
\end_inset

 is not needed in the RHS of the equation because it is already in the 
\begin_inset Formula $J=x-\Psi$
\end_inset

 We can indeed use 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial w_{\nu}}{\partial P_{\psi}}=\frac{\frac{\partial w_{\nu}}{\partial P_{\nu}}}{\frac{\partial P_{\psi}}{\partial P_{\nu}}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial w_{\Delta}}{\partial P_{\psi}}=\frac{\partial w_{\Delta}}{\partial P_{\nu}}\cdot\frac{\partial P_{\nu}}{\partial P_{\psi}}$

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial P_{\nu}}{\partial P_{\psi}}$

To be clear our measure for the price of quality is simply the calculation
 of quality against needs - As such higher subsistence level (higher price
 needs) prices would mean higher price of quality - provided the distance
 from needs is embedded in our measurement of the price of quality.
 Similarly, lower subsistence (i.e.
 lower prices of needs basket) would mean lower price of quality.
 Here what we mean by subsistence - is a level of utility - a sort of poverty
 line defined by the cost of the minimum basket 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which in turns depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\psi}$

The typical life-cycle consumption patterns can be confirmed with the significan
ce of age-related coefficients.
 More particularly, the quality (excess) consumption seems to decline with
 age while durable good purchases do not seem to be influenced by age as
 much.
 Apart from the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and needs, the disposable income (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

) also depends on the durable goods someone owns through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which includes durable good-bearing costs).
 Thus a weak significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 simultaneously with a strong significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 implies a stronger effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that have much influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (durable goods such as land that do not require a high maintenance cost
 proportional to their cost are purchased less often than those that have
 higher bearing costs).
 Further, the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 is negative while it is positive for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that higher disposable income (lower needs or higher income)
 is more often associated with higher quality (excess) and less durable
 good purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is statistically weak, but the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is quite significant.
 More durable goods purchases are made by those who are already rich in
 relative terms, the new durable goods purchased are mostly those that are
 associated with high running costs.
 While the distribution of wealth - reflected in the ownership of expensive
 durable goods such as a house or land - do determine which consumers purchase
 new durable goods, the significance of disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

 (shown as lt1 in the table) - which we estimate using occupation, education
 and needs over the years 2012 and 2014 - and its negative coefficient for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 indicates that the new durable goods are purchased by those with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which is inclusive of durable goods bearing costs) and/or the new durable
 good purchases are by those who have relatively less incomes (
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 estimated through better occupation and education).
 This trend seems to reverse for the measure of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the ownership of durable good such as land and housing, disposable
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the sort of wealth that lends to more social mobility.
 The educated and the highly-paid may pass on their skills and social networks
 to the progeny, but the transfer of such soft-durable goods to the next
 generation is more dissipative than the monetary wealth.
 Such soft-assets might not result in the ownership of more expensive durable
 goods (such as housing or land) but these do require consumption on education
 and social functions anyways.
 The durable good purchases may suggest the limits of the durable goods
 purchases.
 This is made clearer with the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for expenditure on quality(

 Those with less durable goods but with better income do seem to spend more
 on quality (including education).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in urban and rural lifestyles also play a role in the difference
 in durable good purchases as well as quality.
 This is in particular due to the the availability of electricity being
 limited to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for and more likely to
 deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption in an environment of uneven prices for relative quality.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived risk in one's stability of wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the the participants exhibiting a risk-seeking
 behaviour (i.e.
 a disproportionate expenditure) towards goods and services that may lead
 to a large payoff (immense success) with a small probability (through joining
 golf clubs, engaging in social events - status competitions with a small
 upfront cost).
 This may serve as a refinement to the conventional assumptions of a balance
 between the urban and rural prices in the models that explore rural migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While visible items do capture such risk-seeking behaviours in the developed
 economies very well, the difference in wealth and the segregation of quality
 of life in the developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they
 may be in segregated societies in the developed economies).
 Without a
\bar under
 
\bar default
consideration of how the durable goods are distributed in the economy and
 are subject to change, one must be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed this is not to say that the consumption on items that are categorically
 visible does not tell us much about the demand in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption - and is worth exploring in its own right - but
 if one were to develop a theory of status consumption instead of revisiting
 visible consumption in varied cultural contexts in this manner, the considerati
ons of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership seem an obvious
 first step.
 Indeed in the particular case of marriages too, we would only improve our
 understanding of the bride price if we realise that marriages are both
 an indication of one's social status as well as a potential for advancement
 in social ranking - forces that are at play in durable goods purchases
 more generally in much the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the literature on rural and urban differences in the developing
 world should be extended to include status consumption on grounds of generality.
 The context of status consumption varies significantly across economies
 and one often needs to make adjustments for the particular social conditions
 to draw conclusions on visible consumption.
 Using an intertemporal behavioural model to explain consumption may help
 us in standardising the markets for status in disparate economies and help
 us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across the various states of economies.

Limitations of the additive loglinear utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To detail the limitation of an additive loglinear utility, consider a general
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\beta_{i}log(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, if the budget constraint is set to be 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}$
\end_inset

, then the optimisation using a Lagrangian leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $L=u-\lambda(\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}-x)$
\end_inset

.
 The first-order conditions imply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
x=\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}\\
\frac{\beta_{i}}{q_{i}-\gamma_{i}}=\lambda p_{i}
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})=1$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})=\beta_{i}(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 the Marshallian demand function).
 The indirect utility function - of which cost function is the inverse of
 - can be written as

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
u & =\sum{\beta_{i}}log(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}(x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}))
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{k}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})+\sum\beta_{i}log((x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}))\Rightarrow u=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})+log(x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}})$
\end_inset

.
 The cost function thus becomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
log(c(u,\textbf{p})-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}) & =u-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})\label{eq:loglineargeneral}

 up linearly with the logarithm of outlay i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{log(x)-a(p)}{b(p)-a(p)}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

An useful intuition for the PIGLOG cost-functions (see Deaton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonMuellbauerAIDS"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is its view as a linear decomposition of the logarithm of outlay (
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

) into costs of subsistence (
\begin_inset Formula $u=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$
\end_inset

) and bliss (
\begin_inset Formula $u=1$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p)$
\end_inset

).
 In this form, the cost function in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:loglineargeneral"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 would be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
log(c(u,\textbf{p})-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}) & =(1-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}))u+(-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}))(1-u)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost-function formulation shows just how restrictive a loglinear direct
 utility function really is.
 The above direct utility form of the loglinear utility claims that the
 price derivatives of cost-functions (which are typically equated with the
 budget ratio in the econometric analysis i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial p_{i}}$
\end_inset

) are the same for both subsistence and bliss sub-utilities.
 This is a strong assumption if one were to consider status utility using
 the loglinear formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus for the consumer choice between consuming value 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 (which the consumer avails in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) and increasing asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, a general PIGLOG cost-function would allow the sensitivity of savings
 rate (choice between consuming in the current period vs saving for future)
 with respect to prices of quality and durable goods to be different at
 subsistence and bliss levels.
 The cost-function can still be used to describe the dynamics of the model
 just equally well.
 Much the way a direct utility function under a budget constraint explains
 that a higher price makes it difficult to obtain the same utility (comprising
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{q}=\{q_{i}\}$
\end_inset

), the cost-function approach shows how a higher price causes a consumer
 to avail less utility for the same cost (
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

).

 Such conditions of a narrow difference between

 is virtually unbounded.
 This asymmetry has implications for status consumption as well.
