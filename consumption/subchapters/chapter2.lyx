\begin_layout Abstract
The economic inequalities in developing economies often persist both across
 wider geographical areas and within densely populated cross-section of
 urban areas.
 The urban migration pressures are often implied due to the uneven growth
 - in particular due to the sparse opportunities for both intergenerational
 mobility and improvements in consumption.
 Considering how consumer demand for education and non-durable commodities
 responds to local and wider disparities in prosperity relative to a reference
 area, the current study explains the implications of differences in contexts
 across two representative countries in the sub-Saharan Africa.

 changes in the intergenerational rankâ€“rank correlations.
 Since 1850s, the managerial positions seem to employ a relatively less
 educated population - as education hasn't kept pace with the higher demand
 for managerial positions with the expansion of economy.
 All occupations (except the jurists, engineers - where required skillset
 seems to have expanded), therefore, have declined in the ranks thus defined.

 The presented chapter addresses why - despite industrialisation being more
 recent in the developing economies - a general trend for intergenerational
 mobility may not be observed for the developing economies either.

 wealth and educational mobility in greater detail for sub-Saharan Africa
 in the chapter.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The focus of the current chapter is on educational mobility in sub-Saharan
 Africa - where the studies on intergenerational mobility have relied on
 a human capital view of mobility.
 With the attainment of primary school education as a measure of mobility,
 for example, a cross-country examination by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 notes a segmentation in educational mobility due to varied levels of infrastruc
ture and educational institutions across the continent.
 The focus on educational and occupational attainments remains admissible
 for sub-Saharan Africa foremost due to the changes brought about by industriali
sation being much more recent.
 As the cross-country examination by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 points out, less than 40% children of parents who haven't completed primary
 education end up completing primary education in the sub-Saharan Africa
 - with an extreme variation across the continent (2% for S Sudan and 80%
 for S Africa).
 Further, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "IversenKrishnaSenPovertyEscapes2019"

\end_inset

 point out, the income-based measures of intergenerational mobility (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fieldsmcgillivrayinequality2006"

\end_inset

) - if possible - are ruled out also because the earnings or income-based
 recalls are often not meaningful in the surveys from developing economies
 (also see

\begin_layout Standard
Focusing on the notion of educational mobility, we find out in particular
 how the differences in paternal educational levels, long-term assets and
 the urban-rural divide could influence consumption and education-expenses.
 The problem we address is similar in many ways with the exploration of
 consumer welfare and consumption with respect to non-land assets and educationa
l choices by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lambertintergenerational2014"

.
 We comment also on the rift between urban and rural areas - a concern that
 has been reported in nearly every study on intergenerational mobility in
 sub-Saharan Africa (see for example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BossuroyCogneauMobilityAfrica2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The empirical analyses use the data on ownership of long-term assets as
 well as that on geographic locations for the districts where consumers
 reside - to explain the role which differences in prosperity levels

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The most common mechanisms through which the difference in prosperity levels
 may affect mobility are the asymmetrical human capital investments (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corakintergenerationalmobility2004"

\end_inset

) and possible residential segregation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the negative association between inequality and mobility has been
 noted in cross-country comparisons (see for example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corakintergenerationalmobility2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the association appears to become less strong when mobility is measured
 in terms of social (ordinal) classification (rather than income or earnings)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 This again is due to the notions of occupational mobility or educational
 mobility deviating from each other (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "IversenKrishnaSenPovertyEscapes2019"

 with the context of educational mobility while treating education as expenses

\begin_layout Standard
For the within-country comparisons of expenditure towards mobility (interpreted
 as education expenses) in Tanzania and Nigeria, the notion of relative
 prosperity is considered both within a geographical reference area and
 across geographical areas.
 In a simple model we outline in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, an improvement in prosperity for the consumer residing in a certain area
 of reference depends on her inheritable wealth, her occupational or educational
 status and any positive externality (or affluence) associated with being
 in the area of reference of a certain prosperity level.
 The essential claim for the treatment of education as expenses for educational
 mobility is that a consumer who is better equipped with educational or
 occupational status may be better prepared for higher prosperity.
 A utility function thus formulated comprises of the three variables - the
 consumption in the area of reference, the area of reference itself and
 the expenditure that prepares the consumer to be in richer area of reference.
 The educational expenditures - interpreted as the consumer's preparedness
 to be in a improved surrounding area - are then compared against the consumptio
n on assets (durable goods) and non-durable consumption in the a particular
 area of reference with a seeming-unrelated regression (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZellnerSureg1962"

\end_inset

).
 The empirical results are used to explain how the different contexts of
 income level and consumption in the two economies could result in disparate
 education expenditures.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that such a comparison of consumption and education expenses
 against prosperity and consumer characteristics such as education, asset-level
 and occupation may have implications for two specific areas of research.
 First, the consumer characteristics and prosperity may have implications
 for migration pressures in the economy.
 More particularly, if the costs of living and amenities are less varied
 across reference areas in the economy, then a consumer may be indifferent
 between staying in a poorer reference and a moving to a higher reference
 with higher relative poverty.
 This - however - changes when the difference in reference areas are extreme
 in terms of opportunities and prevent immediate mobility (to surrounding
 areas).
 Second, the distribution of educational and occupational skills across
 the economy influences the access to certain types of consumption - which
 may have implications for status-related consumption in the economy.
 When a poorer reference has less opportunities both for mobility and status
 consumption, then the escape to a richer reference may act as a door to
 improbable mobilities for the consumer - amounting to a change of context
 more important to the consumer than a simple gain in income levels.

 In particular, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 notes the inadequacies of an objective notion of status - suggesting that
 the context of the consumer be measured and accounted for in order to have

 While considering reference groups in the context of status, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 enumerates three types of statuses - the objective, the subjective and

 These notions of status have considered of importance in the later the
 seminal work from

 Focusing on relative deprivation in Britain, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 notes three types of reference groups that could be relevant in a study
 - the reference group could be a comparative group (one the consumer compares
 herself to), a membership group (which the consumer thinks she belongs
 to) or a normative group (where the consumer gets her standards from).
 Depending on a given perspective, the criteria for identifying a reference
 group may vary - but the notion of reference groups remains of key importance
 in much of literature in social sciences - including the current behavioural
 approaches to decision under risk (see

 relevant to the consumer.

 The current model considers the effect of occupational and educational

 her consumption relative to the prosperity of her normative reference group
 with ii) preparing to be in an area of higher prosperity.
 The consumer of a certain age

 thus selects a particular area of prosperity by optimising a reference-bound
 utility that she achieves from i) being in the reference area of a certain

While it could also be argued that higher assets are generally associated
 with higher income in an economy (consumer with higher assets get favoured

 to be reflected in the consumer's static characteristics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference-bound utility we formulate in the model is an increasing function
 of the consumption - consisting both of liquid assets and the non-durable
 consumption.
 It is worth highlighting that the expenditures that enhance the consumer's
 preparedness to move to a different area of prosperity (i.e.
 education expenses) are treated differently from expenditures on consumption.
 These education expenditures encompass our notion of mobility vis-a-vis
 the preparedness of the consumer to be in a higher reference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mobility expenditures also allow an inertia from moving away to a poorer
 reference for a gain in relative positional advantage.
 For example, a consumer after having a certain educational level or having
 specialised in a particular occupation may not move back (due to lower
 utility implied) to the reference poorer in absolute terms (measured by
 average long-term assets in the reference).
 Similarly, acquiring assets that are tied to a particular area of reference
 (e.g.
 property or equipment) could bring an inertia to the consumer by limiting
 her movement away from the current area reference and increase her readiness
 due to the resale value of the assets.
 The utility function is therefore to allow both the inertia and mobility
 to depend on the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and the prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 of the consumer's normative reference group.
 An implicit assumption is that all areas of prosperity in the economy except
 the one with the highest richness offer a fair chance of improvement a
 reference of a slightly improved richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in the consumer's proximity.
 Since urban settings offer an environment that cannot be replicated in
 the rural environment, this ensures that the choice to move up to an area
 of higher prosperity is always relevant for every consumer.

 The consumer chooses both

 and the consumption within the reference area of prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 to optimise her utility from the three parameters.
 Notice that the sub-utility from consumption being bound to

\end_inset

 means that there are diminishing returns from consumption relative to a
 particular reference of prosperity

 Thus on one hand, the model allows the consumer in a poorer area of reference
 to be satisfied with the same or lower absolute consumption than that of
 the average consumer in the richer area of prosperity while on the other
 hand, the utility from relative richness with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$

 This selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is thus similar in some ways to how a consumer may postpone fulfillment
 through asset accumulations in an intertemporal setting - but unlike assets,
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 consumers in the area of prosperity

A concern with the use of a nominative reference group may be that certain
 prevalent social groups in an economy could be the cause of a disparity
 within or across geographical areas - thus resulting in an omitted variable
 bias when ignored.
 For this to be true, however, such a social identity (race, religion or
 other) must both be observed at a wider level across all the geographical
 areas of reference and have a direct influence on the consumer's prosperity.
 While we do consider the controls corresponding to religious affiliation
 and linguistic preferences in the two economies, we also don't find any
 evidence for a significant political disadvantage to a specific social
 identity in either Nigeria and Tanzania.
 Therefore, while social identities may have a role to play at the finer
 levels within the geographical area of reference, their role across all
 the geographic areas are unlikely to be separate from the controls of prosperit
y and geographical disparities.
 This is not to say that the consumer societies in sub-Saharan Africa -
 much like elsewhere - are not organised around clans or social groups,
 but the effect of reference groups implied by such micro-identities at
 the finer levels are unlikely to be significant if the diverse identities
 are dispersed over the wider geographical extent and do not form a separate
 social group with a direct disadvantage to their prosperity.
 More specifically, if the communities within a geographical area

 do not share a social disadvantage with the community members in another
 geographical area 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

 in the two areas would dominate the factors for consumption.
 This, while we consider the effects of social identities on consumption,
 the relevance of social identities does not interfere with the definition
 of a normative reference group based on geographical locations.

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(t,\rho)$
\end_inset

 and the demographic characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 could imply either an inertia or a push for mobility to the consumer household.
 In terms of the model, a consumer household having acquired more assets
 over time (high 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(t,\rho)$
\end_inset

 ), may not get as much utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r,t)$
\end_inset

 and thus become reluctant to moving to a different reference.
 Similarly, after having acquired a higher educational level or a certain
 occupation (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) tied to a reference, the consumer household - despite having a higher
 (liquid) assets- may not consider the higher relative richness in a reference
 area of lower richness.
 The effects on consumption of age, social identity and the inequalities
 in assets within the reference as well as those with respect to neighbouring
 reference areas (corresponding to the above interpretations) are discussed
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 We then use these results to assess the extent to which an increase in
 income (or assets) within and across areas of reference could increase
 the preparedness to move into urban areas as well as the consumption in
 the two economies.

% To reiterate, the dependence of x(r,

 Thus, when the poor reference area are segmented away from the richer reference
 areas in this manner, the substitution between being in a high relative
 position in the poorer reference and being in a richer reference with relative
 poverty is immaterial for the consumer.

While the overall poverty levels appear similar in Nigeria and Tanzania
 , the asset-disparity is observed to be more extreme in Tanzania (particularly
 between the south of the country and the east - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 for Nigeria and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for Tanzania).
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) whereas the income-disparities in occupations and asset-differences appear
 less extreme in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, the inequality in expenditure on non-durable consumption is not
 as different for the two economies.
 This can be verified with the Lorenz curves for total non-durable expenditure
 and total assets in Figure

The range of occupations available to the consumer populations in the surveys
 from Tanzania and Nigeria are varied.
 To compare the role of occupations in the two economies, we standardise
 all the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria into
 occupation ranks ranging from 0 to 3.
 The occupation ranks are essentially based on sorting the varied occupations
 in the two economies by the income of consumers in the respective countries.
 The occupation-ranks mapped from the occupation levels in Tanzania and
 Nigeria are presented in Table

In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this the sparsity of income data - a problem aggravated
 because of informal sectors of a significant size in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 for Nigeria).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also note that the average consumer in the urban areas - with better
 options for lifestyle and consumption - seems to struggle with basic needs
 as well.
 To compare the fulfillment of basic needs in urban vs rural areas, we look
 at the fraction of consumers that have run out of food in the last 12 months
 in every district across both economies (either due to lack of agricultural
 inputs or high prices) in Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TanzaniaFoodShortageAgrInp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NigeriaFoodShortageCosts"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This does suggest a significant number of households running out of food
 in urban areas (due to high costs) - even though the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons).

While we undertake a more detailed view on consumption in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Parametric-Analysis"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the non-parametric view indicates that the disparities in income and assets
 are more localised in Nigeria while they are more extreme in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the disparity in asset ownership across regions is not nearly as extreme
 as in Tanzania.
 We discuss the implications of this non-uniformity on consumption in the
 subsequent sections.

 Here, the prices

\end_inset

 in the reference area - interpreted as the cost of living in the reference

 The measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$

 Other variables are observed at the level of the reference area - such

In an alternate formulation, we regress the educational expenses against
 the same control variables.
 Since having the total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 as the control variable causes a well-known endogeneity problem (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace,ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), we instrument the 
\begin_inset Formula $log(X)$
\end_inset

 with the occupation data in the survey.
 Accepting at most a rejection rate of 10% of a nominal 5% Wald test, the
 eigenvalue test statistic are the higher than 20 (with the critical value
 of 16.38) for the regressions and we thus reject the null hypothesis that
 the instrument is weak.

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two countries have different levels of urbanisation but may be on a
 similar trajectory.
 Policy tell us that the pressure on education may be natural and could
 be seen as urbanisation needs.
 We explore a linear causality with the question: do people spend more education
 as the prosperity increases ? How does this vary against other variables
 such as the mothers/fathers/educ.
 Urbanisation - is measured as prosperity and expenditure on education is
 seen as readiness for mobility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 In the cross-sectional study, we only look at changes in prosperity across
 the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 In the time-series question, we may look at how increase in prosperity
 is responded to by the consumers.
 But this is not available due to measurement errors with assets owned as
 well as missing past hhid information for a significant number of households
 in 2014 for Tanzania.
 This could be done however for 2010-2012 - although it would be out of
 sync with 2012-2015 analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison of the expenses in the two economies is faulty - because of
 the effect of urbanisation brings in a lot about educational institutions.

\begin_layout Standard
The father's educ is collinear with education.
 It needs to be explained better how father's education influences the choice.
 One way is to contrast role of education-rank vs father's education rank.
 Since regressions would give us the results for one variable while keeping
 the other constant, father's education coefficient does not tell us the
 how much it matters together with the education rank itself.
 Since education rank is collinear with the occupation rank, one option
 is to use education-rank (and possibly its cube) as instrument(s), while
 studying the role of father's education and the occupation-rank of expenditure.
