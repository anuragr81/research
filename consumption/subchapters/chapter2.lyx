Status consumption under severe inequality

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role of wealth inequalities
 and spatial exclusion status consumption is less understood in the varied
 contexts of developing countries.
 We develop a model for status consumption based on permanent ownership
 and high quality in non-durable consumption and use the durable goods ownership
 data available in the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata to discuss how
 a segregation of overall quality under conditions of price heterogeneity
 may characterise status consumption in a developing economy.

Recent research on conspicuous consumption suggests its prevalence in both

.
 The ubiquity of conspicuous consumption could imply that consumers maintain
 a consumption level relative to their reference group level regardless
 of how poor an economy is.
 However since reference groups themselves are subject to spatial and economic
 boundaries, the conspicuous consumption in an economy would depend on the
 extent to which the social reference groups are segmented across the population.
 It is quite possible thus that the demand for certain conspicuous goods
 (not commodities) is completely absent in some reference groups that are
 excluded spatially or economically

The relevance of reference groups therefore provides a necessary qualification

 in conspicuous consumption - as the consumers need not emulate the rich
 if their social reference is insulated from the higher requirements of
 income corresponding to a group outside their own social reference.
 If status competitions for a group do not include a significant number
 of consumers outside their own reference or peer group, the status consumption
 would be necessarily segmented across the groups formed on the basis of
 a particular social reference.
 One can hardly claim therefore that the poor majority in a largely impoverished
 economy observes and emulates the lifestyles of a rich microscopic minority.
 The opposing effects of poverty levels and peer-influences on status consumptio
n have not been explored in much detail in the literature - with the exception
 of some studies on the effects of income inequality on conspicuous consumption

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore status consumption in the context of wealth differences and social
 segmentation, we fall back to the notion of how status consumption is used
 to offset existing inequalities in income and economic standing.
 Instead of focusing on the disproportionate demand for signaling-goods
 (i.e.
 conspicuous consumption), therefore we adopt a model based on a social-deferenc
e view of status that has been embraced in many economic studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Our model considers permanent ownership ( owned long-term goods ) and quality
 consumption as the key indicators of status that offset the existing income
 and social hierarchies.
 If the role of status consumption is to influence a ranking of income and/or
 wealth, it follows that two consumers with the same personal characteristics
 and the same set of needs can compete with each other for status only with
 either quality in non-durable consumption or ownership of long-term durable
 goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of poverty and peer effects are incorporated in the model where
 a consumer uses obtains utility through her social characteristics, quality
 in non-durable consumption and long-term durable goods.
 The consumption for quality and permanent ownership subject to the heterogenous
 prices are then explored across different age-groups, regions and levels
 of urbanisation in an economy.
 The model endogenises the role that personal characteristics (such as social
 class, level of education) play in status through the ownership of long-term
 durable goods and the constraints on quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While measuring permanent ownership is relatively easy in the empirical
 analyses when the assets owned by consumers are recorded in the consumption
 microdata, the measurements of quality using conventional methods from
 demand literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 turn out to be less attractive due to their reliance on observed market
 prices of items.
 A workaround is implicitly adopted by the visible consumption studies -
 which focus on items that are assumed to be futile for common use (an assumptio
n attributed to Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Without the assumption of futility of conspicuous items, the sense of quality
 derived from an aggregation of items over commodities as separable groups
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity,McKelveyQuality2011,McKenzie2005,GibsonKimQualityBog2019,DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 would depend on the observed prices of items.
 Thus while the futility assumption does ensure the separability of demand
 for visible goods, it does so at the cost of limiting oneself to a narrowed
 context of quality.
 With a more general notion of quality that permits any high-price non-durable
 consumption or a durable good to contribute to status - a notion which
 we feel is necessary to represent the conditions of a developing economy
 where basic needs are unmet for a significant part of society - we avoid
 making the futility assumption and rely on a view of quality as

 non-durable consumption given the cost of basic needs (both external and
 internal) at a district-level granularity.

In the empirical analysis, therefore we use the context of the saving vs
 consumption problem under an observed heterogeneity of prices of permanent
 ownership and relative quality to understand the data from Living Standards

 Our quantitative model for the combined effect of wealth and consumption
 on one's status - which we use to describe the seemingly opposite effects
 of peer influences and poverty on status competitions - is aimed to be

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen has explored the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

 - but Veblen hardly dwells upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services

Assisted with the developments in game theory and an improvement in the
 quality of microdata from consumption surveys, an interest in Veblen's
 observations has been revived in the recent years (see Frank

 We argue that this recent attention to status consumption need not to be
 viewed asunder from the consumer demand literature on habit-formation (see
 for example Muellbauer

 for the classical treatment of quality and cost-of-living indices).
 Using the intertemporal framework with life-cycle assumptions, one could
 view status consumption as an inertia in moving away from a state of higher
 quality - a tendency that may in turn depend on the long-term characteristics
 such as social identity or education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevance of social identities in consumption habits has been a theme
 visited by much of the literature in conspicuous consumption (see Chao

).
 The literature in marketing studies has similarly explored identity formation
 with acquired goods.
 A model that views consumption in the context of a ranking order based
 on income or wealth, could be used to endogenise the role of social identity
 in conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of status most commonly used in literature is one where it is
 one of the long-term characteristics of the consumer.
 This allows the studies in sociology and health sciences to use status
 as simply a vector education or income (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 This definition for status consumption would poses a necessary paradox
 when used in the cotnext of consumption - if status was only accumulated
 over a sufficiently long-term, how can there be any utility from status
 consumption in an intertemporal framework? This paradox is trivially resolved
 if one considers that status is subject to change with consumption - just
 the way it is shaped by income or education.
 This is the view of status provided by Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990"

\end_inset

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 that has been widely embraced in the economic studies.
 Here, status is viewed as an income-based ranking order that can be altered
 by the consumer with consumption.
 In other words, a consumer achieves status utility through status consumption
 by moving herself up in a ranking order that is otherwise determined by
 wealth and income.
 This is the view that we use in our intertemporal formulation of status
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of developing economies, this view raises some fundamental
 questions on whether the status goods in a developing country should be
 the same as those that are considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed economies or not.
 As the relative wealth differences are more relevant for status differences
 in the developing countries, the wealth differences could have far more
 weight for status than the limited range of visible items available to
 a consumer in the developing world (where industrial development is concentrate
d into fewer urban areas).
 We find that the presence of wealth differences in the developing countries
 is not always given its due attention in much of the literature on conspicuous
 consumption we have surveyed (except for some studies directly exploring
 the effect income inequality on conspicuous consumption with exogenously
 observed poverty/income levels or GINI indices - see Jaikumar

).
 We find that some studies include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in status-related consumption while others choose to focus on
 non-durable consumption.
 We believe that an intertemporal substitution approach - which explicitly
 considers the role of wealth differences on status - could help us assess
 whether the particular long-term durable goods should be viewed as part
 of status consumption in an economy or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presence of social segregation or varied social identities (tribes,
 castes, race etc.) - which may also carry status - poses yet another issue
 in the relevance of visible consumption.
 The presence of social identities may imply that the competitions to reach
 a higher status are segmented.
 The idea that lower economic classes tend to emulate the habits of past
 upper economic classes (i.e.
 pecuniary emulation as defined by Veblen) - must therefore be refined when
 status competitions are always relative to one's own reference group (see

 for empirical perspective on reference groups).
 More specifically, if status competitions are strong only in one's own
 reference group, then the social identities which define such reference
 groups themselves would carry some status and influence status consumption
 much the way wealth differences do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presence of both wealth differences and social identities might not
 pose a serious issue - at least empirically - since segregated identities
 themselves are often a result of long-term economic differences.
 However, in rapidly changing economies it is not necessary that the role
 of social identities and wealth difference on status are always aligned.
 In countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as parts of Asia - where older
 identities are disappearing and being replaced by newer ones - it is possible
 that some social identities are superseded by economic developments while
 some others get more crystallised with the growth in economy.
 The peer influences of the socio-economic identities could therefore inform
 one's notion of status consumption in the economy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the rapid economic developments and creation of new markets for
 status which often serves as a backdrop for visible consumptiojn, it is
 possible that the prevalent socio-economic inequalities in the developing
 world could have far more weight in the developing economies than the consumpti
on of a few conspicuous items that are considered visible in the developed
 economies (see Ustuner-Holt

 (which is how a researcher may obtain the list of visible items) is adjusted
 to include items that may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ).
 The combined effect of social differences and wealth differences on status
 is a quantitative concern which concerns our model for status-related consumpti
on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If status is viewed as a ranking order based on long-term characteristics
 such as income, education then a certain acquired characteristics and consumpti
on may be seen as a way to offset the deep wealth and social hierarchies
 that determine the consumer ranking order (see Corneo 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In an empirical analysis, the wealth of a consumer can be proxied relatively
 easily with the stock of durable goods the consumer has (inclusive of housing,
 land and other long-term assets).
 This is particularly true in the developing economy.
 The contribution of non-durable consumption to status - on the other hand
 - is only through the quality of non-durable consumption.
 This is because the fulfillment of basic needs cannot offer any advantage
 in a status competition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 As long as a common set of consumer needs - which are fundamentally the
 same by definition - can be measured in the population being observed,
 there is no status utility to be achieved through addressing of needs themselve
s.
 This has a particular implication for our model of utility.
 If there is any status related utility to be derived from non-durable consumpti
on, it would be constituted in the felicity from 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
quality (which is defined as distance from needs which themselves are observed
 within a particular reference group).
 It also follows that any status that is not signaled with quality in non-durabl
e consumption or is associate with innate social characteristics of the
 consumer it must come out of the possession of (and thus utility from)
 the long-term durable goods (i.e.
 the proxy of wealth).
 This can also incorporate the life-cycle assumptions if a durable good
 is considered long-term as long as it can be passed on by the consumer
 to its progeny.
 Thus the long-term goods encompass the long-term demands of the consumer
 while her short-term concerns (which could themselves be influenced by
 the acquired wealth) comprise only of needs and quality (inclusive of short-ter
m durable items - if any).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A robust empirical measure of quality has been subject to much debate in
 the literature owing primarily to the lack of sufficiently detailed consumption
 surveys.
 Most consumption surveys hardly record the market-observed prices or the
 quantities of the items consumed - let alone the brand-related details
 of the items.
 This makes the identification of higher quality somewhat non-trivial.
 The market-prices of items purchases or even quantities consumed - which
 could permit us to view quality as the proportion of expensive items standardis
ed by quantity (see Nelson

) - are seldom recorded in the consumption surveys.
 In the instances where they are recorded, they tend to be limited to the
 food items alone.
 In the absence of quantities consumed and the detailed prices of key diary
 items, we use the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quality by consider a higher-than-required consumption based on a minimum
 necessary consumption (this is similar to the problem of cost-of-living
 indices in the literature - see Fisher 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "false"

\end_inset

for the classical approach to the problem).
 Thus we observe how the cost of a standard basket of basic needs varies
 across the regions and districts in the economy and infer the varying cost
 of needs as the basis of our measure for quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recap, as long as the basic needs of the consumer in an economy can be
 determined, the measure of quality is simply the expenditure in

of the cost of needs.
 An empirical assessment of what is consider

 Indeed not having a clear definition of consumer needs amounts to shifting
 the debate on measures of quality to the debate over the definition of
 needs - since the very idea that all of us have a set of basic needs has
 been a controversial one.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need

 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite.
 A starch diet fulfilling the set of dietary needs can thus be ruled out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ideas of health and autonomy may appear slightly abstract but they are
 in fact easy to interpret in a particular cultural setting as the internal
 and external needs of the consumer.
 To infer the reference level of the basic internal needs of the consumer,
 one could focus on the biological needs (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - representing number of household-members, number of children, individual
 age, body weight etc.).
 As we rely on the total of cost of needs for our notion of quality - given
 the lack of consumed quantities in the diary - the price of needs are necessary
 for a measurement of quality.
 The social or spatial context of the consumer has thus a direct effect
 on the total cost of basic internal needs of a consumer (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the demographic vector inclusive of spatial identity and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the effective price of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external needs of the consumer are clearly not encompassed by the biological
 needs alone.
 This is where a particular social context becomes relevant.
 Consider for example the question of whether lodging/home-ownership or
 the primary education of children in the area where a consumer resides
 should be considered a basic need or not.
 Such needs are determined by a social reference point rather than biology.
 The issue with using the biological needs alone as the reference is that
 such an approach would completely ignore the the peer effects that have
 a role in consumer choice.
 For the purposes of measuring conspicuous consumption, the utility a consumer
 avails from the relative quality depends on her perception of what she
 considers necessary (which comprise of the external needs which may encompassin
g a lot more than health and autonomy) rather what is dictated by biology
 alone.
 Thus the cost of relative quality which the consumer derives utility from
 - implicitly considers what is perceived to be higher quality in the consumer's
 own social reference group.
 The inclusion of peer effects - i.e.
 external needs - is necessary in our measure for quality (i.e.
 social reference group consumption).

 An interpretation of quality must therefore also rely on the distance of
 a consumer's non-durable consumption relative to the reference group's
 consumption level (i.e.
 the consumption in the immediate surroundings e.g.
 a locality, a relevant social group, income or owner group of the durable
 goods etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a microeconmic setting, a consumer can avail consumption utility only
 from durable and non-durable good.
 Needs must therefore also depend on the wealth of the consumer or her demograph
ic characteristics.
 This makes sense in the empirical terms as well - since consumer must pay
 maintenance and upkeep costs for the long-term durable goods she inherits
 or purchases.
 Such costs directly contribute to the non-durable consumption and increase
 the reference level of the consumer needs.
 The cost of needs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 could better be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho,A)$
\end_inset

 - considering the prices of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 for a consumer with a demographic vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and the long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which would bear some costs of maintenance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By owning long-term durable goods, the consumer essentially improves her
 social-reference and aims to get ahead of others by maximising her stock
 of durable goods relative to the reference possession level (let's say
 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the reference ownership level).
 The consumer's long-term possessions can be viewed as a commitment that
 to lead to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho,A)$
\end_inset

.
 The cost of needs provided by such a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and the expenditure on the relative quality availed by the consumer would
 thus constitute the total expenditure on non-durable consumption by the
 consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

.
  If the cost for quality level 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in non-durable consumption is observed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(\psi,\nu)$
\end_inset

 for needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\kappa(\psi,\nu)+\Psi(\rho,A,\psi)$

status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that status is not considered an internal need using this approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the level
 of durable goods ownership she achieves while her internal needs are independen
t of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both expensive
 durable goods and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class internal needs
 of the consumer).
 Thus difference between the status of a rich and that of a poor family
 is not through disparate educational needs of the rich and poor children
 but instead through a more general need for both the families combined
 with a different demand for quality of education (with a higher price for
 higher quality).

To motivate a utility function from the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,\nu,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 so far, notice that while the consumer does avail utility within a her
 own social reference point (specified by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

), a utility function should represent the case where all consumers are
 permitted to rank (compare) each other.
 This is a necessary condition for us to define a common utility function
 applicable to all consumers.
 Since status differences do exist across social reference groups as well
 (e.g.
 individuals in one region compare themselves to those from other regions),
 it follows that a consumer must get some utility from the identity of one's
 social reference in order for there to be a higher (lower) status utility
 obtained with a richer (poorer) identity (e.g.
 region, class etc.).
 If this weren't true - i.e.
 if the consumers could get utility inclusive-of-status only from their
 durable goods value and non-durable consumption, then there could be no
 point of indifference at which a consumer in the poor neighborhood could
 trade places with another in a richer neighborhood.
 For status consumption to have some utility to the consumer, the utility
 function - which is the same for all consumers - must also depend on group
 identity in some way so that a rich consumer with low-positioning can be
 convinced to trade places with someone in the poor neighborhood who has
 a higher (local) social-positioning.
 A common utility function for all consumers and the presence of status-related
 consumption - together permit a small fish in a big pond to trade places
 with a big fish in a small pond.
 Both the i) utility from identity to a reference group and ii) social positioni
ng within a reference group are key to our model for status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider an example to illustrate how two consumers may compete for
 a utility inclusive of status.
 Let there be consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 who live in a poor region (small pond) and a rich region (big pond) respectivel
y so that their non-durable consumption levels are 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{P},c_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The average consumption levels in the regions they reside are 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Let's also assume that the values of their respective long-term durable
 goods bear the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}<A_{R}$
\end_inset

 .
 The same is true for the average asset ownership of the regions 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 ,
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 <
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 If we now consider the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P},\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 then the cost above needs can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=\frac{c_{P}-\Psi_{P}}{\psi_{P}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{R}=\frac{c_{R}-\Psi_{R}}{\psi_{R}}$
\end_inset

.
 If status utility were to be only achieved through durable goods and quality
 and if utility were a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

 then there would be no two values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{P},A_{P})\sim(\nu_{R},A_{R})$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 would trade places (ponds) with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the utility model must consider the role of regional identity (or
 peer effects more generally - that can be proxied with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P},\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

, the durable goods values 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P},A_{R}$
\end_inset

 or simply the region dummy).
 Such a utility would allow 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 to increase her non-durable quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}$
\end_inset

 so that she is indifferent to moving to an urban area even for a higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the principle we use to develop the utility function further in

Assuming that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular sense
 - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for visible consumption
 can be considered separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 We do not find futility assumption plausible for the data we observe in
 the developing countries.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For the empirical analyses, probably the most desirable feature of visiblity
 based models is the separability of necessary items from conspicuous items
 that is offered by assuming the conspicuous items are futile (an argument
 attributed to Veblen).
 To accommodate this assertion, the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 often includes items that are just commonly understood to have some signaling
 value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.

 In nascent modern economies of sub-Saharan Africa, however, we find that
 the bandwagon items such as electronics or cars pose obvious empirical
 concerns as they are hardly futile but also serve status needs due to the
 rapid and recent urbanisation.
 The futility assumption is therefore hardly suitable for a model that is
 cognisant of wealth differences in a rapidly developing economy.
 We therefore use a slightly different approach to status consumption that
 is based on the role that long-term durable goods may play towards status

 While these could be related to snob and bandwagon behaviours (see Corneo

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term consumer needs
 does not view status consumption as futile but relates it with measures
 of wealth.
 Status may not be changed by fulfillment of basic needs but is influenced
 both by long-term possessions and non-durable consumption in an intermporal
 setting that we use to understand the status consumption in an economy.

Hierarchy of Consumer Needs

\begin_layout Standard
The claim that much of our model rests upon is that status is a part of
 the consumer's long-term utility.
 If that weren't the case, the representative consumer in the model would
 have no reason to engage in status-related consumption in any form.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a
 consumer can achieve a higher status in the model by the acquisition of
 durable goods (which is assisted with higher income) as well as by the
 status promotion through high-quality non-durable consumption (which may
 enhance social interactions, improve the consumer's self-image and is possible
 to achieve with lower income).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have discussed before, the role of non-durable consumption is two-fold
 in our model - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer
 and second, it achieves high-quality consumption with status-related goals.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity and
 status advantage - since all else being the same, someone consuming a higher
 quality is likely to have more status than someone consuming a lower quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The utility from status consumption is a combination of short-term and long-term
 goals of the consumer.
 The short-term goals are fulfilled with non-durable consumption and the
 long-term goals through ownership of durable goods or assets of high value.
 The social characteristics such as residence, neighborhood or social class
 could be viewed as cumulative status items that are acquired over multiple
 generations.
 As long as one may assume that the rewards of status are passed on to the
 progeny, this view of social characteristics allows us to view status competiti
ons - which develop within a particular social reference group - in a utility
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the temporal hierarchy of status items, some items that bring status
 are more temporary than others.
 Social identity is the most permanent of all possessions, while ownership
 of durable goods is more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 In an intertemporal substitution framework, the representative consumer,
 once having addressed her basic needs, would therefore attempt to distribute
 her total (income) outlay into the three variables that contribute to status.
 Here, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 does not change in her lifetime, she may only be influenced by it.
 Thus all the consumers that share the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 could to compete for status with both the durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and quality in non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 .
 It follows that when consumers with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 compete with each other for status, their respective 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 contributes to the utility.
 As social characteristics themselves may only have an epistemological value,
 we assume that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for consumers carries a direct utility proportional proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the overall possession of the social group with the characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - it being the only mechanism of how a consumer derives utility from the
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 Therefore, the ownership of durable goods is a more dynamic means of indicating
 status than acquiring or inheriting a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 As we have already considered the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$

 - i.e.
 the wealth which someone having a social characteristics

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is always relative to the social reference level 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$

 Thus the utility from durable goods could be seen as proportional to (
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

) where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is measure of the group-level durable-goods possession 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Empirically, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is simply the total cost of durable goods owned by a consumer (or a household).
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase durable goods and the actual
 purchase of durable goods.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$

 durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$

 All the long-term durable goods in the economy are as if they were managed

The most transient of all possessions are the non-durable items.
 We have already defined a control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 By the very definition of the needs, a consumer is meant to select a quality
 control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 only after her basic needs - internal and external - are fulfilled (including
 the maintenance costs that are imposed by ownership of durable goods).

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}(A,\rho,\psi)$
\end_inset

 for the household - where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the long-term durable goods account, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 the social characteristics vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 the basic needs of the consumer.
 A higher value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 would imply a longer distance from the needs cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 and a lower future growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (due to constraints on total income).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, a consumer who changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (by moving residence or being initiated into an new social group) faces
 a new set of needs based on her new environment (and is not expected to
 carry over her habits in from the past environment).
 Therefore the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in non-durable consumption is obtained through a measure of group behaviour
 associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (for example, with the changed costs in the new neighborhood for somebody
 who moves into a new neighborhood).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, while the consumer does not choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, there is a substitution between the expenditure on 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The intertemporal substitution between durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and non-durable consumption quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 implies that a consumer may want to save for durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 or consumer more on short-term quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The choice amongst 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is not lexicographic - and the consumers with the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would compete for status with different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the consumers with the same level of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 may also compete with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 Given such a substitution, the combined utility could most simply be represente
d with an additive loglinear form: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\upsilon(\rho,A,\nu,\psi) & =k_{A}log(s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A))+k_{\psi}log(\psi)+k_{\nu}log(\nu)+k_{\rho}log(\int_{\rho}A)\label{eq:loglinearutil}

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A}+k_{\psi}+k_{\nu}+k_{\rho}=1$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another feature of the consumer choice with variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A,\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 that is ostensibly unrelated with the above outlined temporal hierarchy
 is the set of constraints that are imposed by the longer-term choices on
 the available short-term options.
 The longer-term choices are more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

permanent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that they 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

protect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one's status - as they introduce the possibilities of status-signalling
 through less permanent means.
 A particular state or characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 of the consumer could constraint or enhance the available choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, much the way 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may constrain 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 For example, having an urban residence opens up the access to a wider market
 for status goods.
 In household-related consumption, similarly, the high prices of housing
 may encourage a consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus
 increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

) but she may improve the overall quality instead of buying a bigger house
 only until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 Thus the consumers with lower weight for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 may compensate by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 but only as much.
 The effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is not only a herd-effect but is often a direct result of the costs imposed
 by the durable goods one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.).
 These constraints are treated in the model as part of the needs cost function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 - which includes both the effects peer influences 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and possession of long-term durable goods

).
 For example, the role of unavailability of certain goods in a particular
 region (e.g.
 electricity - particularly relevant in the context of developing countries)
 would be represented simply with a suppressed costs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason why such constraints on choices are not entirely unrelated to
 the temporal hierarchy we have specified is that a certain commitment is
 always implied once a long-term choice is made.
 Certain costs are necessarily associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - both of which (along with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 if a consumer could change her characteristics) are long-term commitments
 of the consumer.
 If a consumer chooses to be on a trajectory of higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

, the consumer might have less concerns for status ( a choice where life-cycle
 effects have a direct influence).
 Similarly, the ownership of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 also presents a commitment - albeit less inescapable than 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - since 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be sold in the market or rented out for income.
 The constraints which choices present are thus part of the temporal hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving further into the dynamics of the model, we assume that at the end
 of the lifetime of a consumer, the personal wealth of the consumer would
 either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so that the asset
 account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth of some other
 household(s) in the economy.
 Consequently, all consumers in the population differ in the the starting
 amount of their asset accounts as well as the trends of their salaries.
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and her salary after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau-\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

 years of working is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 then at a given age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (the start of working age is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

), she could have purchased some long-term durable-goods from a portion
 of her income - deciding that she does not want more durable goods for
 the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, she could have experienced a change in the life-circumstances
 (needing a bigger or a more expensive house) thus needing more durable
 goods urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Due to minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing countries,
 we assume an environment of negligible credit.
 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only durable goods available in the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider how two consumers that are vastly separated by their
 respective characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1},\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho_{1}}A<\int_{\rho_{2}}A$
\end_inset

 or vice versa) might behave in the model.
 Recall that the utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (weight 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\rho})$
\end_inset

 means that someone with a group that has a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 an urbanite or someone in a privileged social class) would be believed
 to be rich - even though her real wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 might be at same level with someone with a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 a rural person or someone with an underprivileged social class).
 What permits the decomposition of utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into those through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the social observation of individuals in terms of identities that are
 established through long-term political or economic events.
 Thus an urbanite or someone with a privileged social class might not need
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth to indicate a higher status when compared with a rural person or
 someone from an under-privileged class who may have the same or even higher
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wealth.
 Yet since competitions for status matter within one's own social reference
 group and since inference of status is through observation, the individuals
 from respective social classes would continue to compare themselves within
 the same social reference group as well as those outside their social reference
 group - implying the relevance of both 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such effects could also mean that the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 dominate to such an extent that competing with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

 might not matter towards status competitions.
 Consider what happens when someone changes their social reference group
 (e.g.
 by moving residence or establishing social networks outsides one's reference
 group).
 In such a case, one has to to adjust to the higher (or lower) 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (due to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\rho)$
\end_inset

).
 However, the very fact that such move is possible (or even subjectively
 imaginable) justifies the existence of a common utility function for all
 consumers.
 There must exist a point of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho_{1},A_{1},\nu_{1})\sim(\rho_{2},A_{2},\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 so that it is feasible that the poorest individual in the privileged social
 class (or the urban area) agrees to trade places with the richest of the
 unprivileged class (or the rural area).

In equilibrium, we consider that the utility from

This is not far-fetched in a developing economy.
 However, outside the developing economy contexts, if needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 expansion of family) were to be treated as part of the consumer choice,
 we may consider that an individual could delay or suspend the expansion
 of family in order to fulfill a target 
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 The basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and the utility one gets from 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 for a rich and poor individual may be the same but the costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A,\rho)$
\end_inset

 the two may face depends both on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 When faced with imminent expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, therefore the consumer could discourage potential changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 so as to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 (by keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 This effect is indeed ignored with the assumption of a predetermined 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 being predetermined for every consumer in the economy implies that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 is nearly constant with time, the consumer exercises her choice only by
 distributing income between 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{1},A_{1}-m(\int_{\rho_{1}}A))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{2},A_{2}-m(\int_{\rho_{2}}A))$
\end_inset

 in a two-period model.
 In other words, the only true substitution is between

In a typical solution of the intertemporal problem, the wealth constraint
 for the optimisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $U=u_{0}+u_{1}$
\end_inset

 would consider the final 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 all of the consumer's durable goods being liquidated and consumed in the
 last period) and the discounting rate based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - but in our case, we prefer to track the change in asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 at every period i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Using a dynamic optimisation formulation, we write the following constraints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
J_{1}\equiv x_{1}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{1},A_{1})=(P_{\nu,1}\psi_{1})\nu_{1}+\Delta_{1}P_{A,1}\nonumber \\
J_{2}\equiv x_{2}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{2},A_{2})=(P_{\nu,2}\psi_{2})\nu_{2}+\Delta_{2}P_{A,2}\label{eq:J_constraints}
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A,i}$
\end_inset

 is the price of durable-goods in period 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu,i}$
\end_inset

 represents the prices of durable goods and non-durable consumption quality
 respectively.
 The above means that the consumer may consume quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{3...}$
\end_inset

 being undefined) in the periods 1 and 2 while she bears the cost of the
 needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\rho,\psi_{1},A_{1}),\Psi(\rho,\psi_{2},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 (in periods 1 and 2 respectively).
 She may save for growth to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of consuming all her outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu_{t}\psi_{t}+\Psi_{t}(\psi_{t},A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 she can spend all of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}$
\end_inset

 (respectively) or save some of it towards 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If we observe the states of the wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0},A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

, consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\{c_{1},c_{2}\},$
\end_inset

 cost of necessities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2}\}$
\end_inset

, the prices of quality units (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu,t}$
\end_inset

) and that of durable goods (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A,t}$
\end_inset

), then we can solve for the parameters that govern the utility function
 additive over time i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we assume that the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 grow deterministically i.e.
 the process 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is fixed, the outlay to be distributed in expenditure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t},A_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in\{1,2\}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{t}=x_{t}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{t},A_{t})=\iota(i_{t},\psi_{t},A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:J_constraints"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 To motivate the dynamic programming approach to this solution, consider
 first what consumer's choices would be in a one-period consumption.
 Here, she could either spend her outlay as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{_{1}}=\nu_{1}\psi_{1}+\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or keep the minimum consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0,c_{1}=\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

) in the period and end up with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, then the first-order conditions would provide us the optimal condition
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Let this utility be 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*},A_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 To extend this to two periods with dynamic optimisation one can exploit
 the fact that a consumer independently optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 would always obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are unbounded functions 
\begin_inset Formula $max(u_{1}+u_{2})\le max(u_{1})+max(u_{2})=u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is only a tool to formulate the dynamic optimisation approach - using which
 the value of utility is to be optimised over her life period in a 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

-period model (
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 being the age of the consumer).
 Thus in the optimisation of utility function in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:twoperiodoptim"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the consumer must optimise both 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 in periods 1 and 2 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have put no restrictions on 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu,1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu,2}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A,1},k_{A,2})$
\end_inset

 (other than that they should add to unity in every period).
 Some structure can be added to the consumer choice by introducing life
 life-cycle effects with a form of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu},k_{A}$
\end_inset

 that depends on the age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of the consumer.
 The rationale is simply that the same level of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 would offer less utility to the consumer as shes age (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 declines with age) or that the same level of long-term durable goods has
 higher utility later in life (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A}$
\end_inset

 increases with age).
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\nu},k_{A}$
\end_inset

 could be assumed to have a form 
\begin_inset Formula $n(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau)$
\end_inset

 - functions known to the consumer that vary with the age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of the consumer.
 In economies that are segregated based on long-term durable goods that
 are largely intergenerational (and thus long-term enough for their utility
 to not change over time), the sensitivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau,A)$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 may be very little and could allow us to use a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau)$

The above solution highlights some remarkable features of how a substitution
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may be influenced by social charactersitics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and life-cycle effects.
 An obvious implication is that higher needs suppress the total outlay for
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Also evident is that in absolute terms, the richer consumers would find
 it more expensive to indicate wealth to their surrounding (it's cheaper
 for a poor person to get richer).
 The equivalent argument applies for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A,t}$
\end_inset

 increases with time (due to the form that we've assumed), the consumer
 would increase her ownership of durable goods accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the above model does explain a substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t},A_{t}$
\end_inset

 with stated assumptions, there are reasons to doubt both the utility of
 a loglinear formulation for empirical analyses and validity of the forms
 
\begin_inset Formula $n(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 As we show with the help of a cost-function formulation, the loglinear
 utility does limit how status utility could relate to price of quality
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

 - the variation of which with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 provides a particular context to status consumption.
 Thus while we have used the direct utility model to explain the model dynamics,
 a cost-function formulation provides a more general framework for the econometr
ic analyses.

Let us first look at the limitation posed by the log-linear utility in more

 For a general 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\beta_{i}log(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})$

\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, if the budget constraint is set to be 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}$
\end_inset

, then the optimisation using a Lagrangian leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $L=u-\lambda(\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}-x)$
\end_inset

.
 The first-order conditions imply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
x=\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}\\
\frac{\beta_{i}}{q_{i}-\gamma_{i}}=\lambda p_{i}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})=1$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})=\beta_{i}(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 the Marshallian demand function).

\begin_layout Standard
The cost-function formulation shows just how restrictive a loglinear direct
 utility function really is.
 The above direct utility form of the loglinear utility claims that the
 price derivatives of cost-functions (which are typically equated with the
 budget ratio in the econometric analysis i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\frac{\partial log(c(u,\textbf{p}))}{\partial p_{i}}$
\end_inset

) are the same for both subsistence and bliss sub-utilities.
 This is a strong assumption if one were to consider status utility using
 the loglinear formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus for the consumer choice between consuming value 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 (which the consumer avails in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) and increasing asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, a general PIGLOG cost-function would allow the sensitivity of savings
 rate (choice between consuming in the current period vs saving for future)
 with respect to prices of quality and durable goods to be different at
 subsistence and bliss levels.
 The cost-function can still be used to describe the dynamics of the model
 just equally well.
 Much the way a direct utility function under a budget constraint explains
 that a higher price makes it difficult to obtain the same utility (comprising
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{q}=\{q_{i}\}$
\end_inset

), the cost-function approach shows how a higher price causes a consumer
 to avail less utility for the same cost (
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary reason we adopt the cost-function approach is that it readily
 extends itself to the case when consumers face different prices based on
 their 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another option - which we find less realistic - is to let the price derivatives
 depend directly on 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 (instead of on the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{p}$
\end_inset

 alone).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 More specifically, if we can assume that participants compete in a market
 for status with quality and permanent ownership with varied respective
 prices, the PIGLOG formulation could be used to better quantify how the
 variation in prices of subsistence and bliss influences the consumption
 choices for the consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cost function and heterogeneity of prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In term of the cost-function, a heterogeneity in price of commodities means
 that the utility units purchased per unit of money (at subsistence or bliss
 levels) would depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Such a heterogeneity in prices can exist for both quality and permanent
 ownership and is likely to be severe in the developing economies where
 structural issues - such as high transportation costs, under-developed
 markets or lack of centralised incentives - are commonplace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we are not concerned with the causes of heterogeniety in prices per
 se, it is worth commenting that the dependence of price on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is driven both by income inequalities and herding effects.
 Not only do the poor have insufficient income to increase their utility,
 they might also face the conditions of low intergenerational mobility (i.e.
 the opportunities for higher future wealth are generally limited to those
 who are already somewhat wealthy) - thus flocking in areas where bliss
 is lower (overall) compared to where the rich tend to live.
 The heterogeneity in price of (blissful) durable goods is also an effect
 of such structural conditions

 The more unequal an economy is, in fact more limited would be the high-end
 durable goods to the very few in an economy - implying higher costs of
 bliss for certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 As higher levels of utility are costly and the lower income cluster necessarily
 disadvantaged when exhibiting a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 , it would makes sense to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p,\rho)$

\begin_layout Standard
There are three important points to be underpinned before getting into a
 discussion of empirical issues.
 First is that in the context of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well as non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

, the prices in the above formulation are those of commodities and not items.
 So even though the purchase prices (directly observed, recorded or recalled
 in the survey) for individual items are unavailable in a survey, the empirical
 analyses could proceed as long as one may reliably approximate the price
 of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and that of permanent ownership 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Second, the life-cycle effects are already part of the model as the effective
 price of quality increases with increase in needs (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}\psi$
\end_inset

).
 Lastly, bliss and subsistence in the PIGLOG formulation merely present
 high and low levels of utility rather than the psychological state or goals
 of the consumers that they wish to achieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coming back to the heterogeneity of prices in the PIGLOG formulation (Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PIGLOG"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in costs of bliss does not always imply an exclusion from higher bliss.
 On the contrary, the presence of peer effects implies that certain values
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

 would also contribute to a higher bliss than from another value 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Even though the rich live in a better neighborhood and indicate higher
 status put together - someone not so rich amongst the rich might want to
 stay in a poorer neighborhood if she prefers to have a higher relative
 income.
 In other words, an individual who is surrounded by the relatively poorer
 is likely to obtain the same utility as someone who is richer in absolute
 terms but poorer relative to her surroundings.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $b(P_{A},P_{\nu},\rho)$
\end_inset

 thus also accounts for the status benefit from due to a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 (and a high 
\begin_inset Formula $s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

).
 That said however, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 does work both by denying bliss and granting it - we can be sure that a
 higher utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is unlikely to be granted at lower levels of subsistence.
 This is simply because the individuals with different characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A},\rho_{B}$
\end_inset

 who are both poor would be indifferent to trading places with each other
 (equivalently, an extremely poor individual does not gain much utility
 by changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 e.g.
 by moving residence or joining another social network )

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 could be had both through 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 indirectly) and through 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the PIGLOG formulation as well.
 The direction of how peer effects influences utility is evident from how
 both 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\rho,A,\psi)$
\end_inset

 ) and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

) contribute to utility.
 Consider for example what the relevance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for subsistence i.e the function 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 implies for status consumption.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 drives subsistence costs, then the reference level of needs (through price
 of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

) is driven by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (higher or lower based on its specific values) and bliss becomes more expensive
 for the particular value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Living in an impoverished region - for example - does drive status and
 utility.
 Even though the consumers in an impoverished region (i.e.
 with a certain value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 ) may ignore the outside world for peer comparisons and have bliss despite
 lower possessions than those outside their region, they are unlikely to
 have any bliss if their subsistence is not being met.
 Thus the conditions of 
\begin_inset Formula $a(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p)$
\end_inset

 leave little for participation in status with the outside world (perhaps
 making the choice to migrate an optimal choice for the consumer).
 If on the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 does not drive subsistence (i.e.
 if basic needs are actually cheaper in the poor region) but it drives bliss,
 then the consumer could substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $(s(A)-\sigma(\int_{\rho}A),\nu)$
\end_inset

 - and an indifference between the choice to avail relative quality in the
 region and living in a region outside might exist.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, if a group that has a higher education ( i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 represents the degree of education) faces different subsistence levels
 form someone not having a higher education, then there is little substitution
 of being educated (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 If on the other hand, the educated individuals have different bliss and
 subsistence costs are not particularly sensitive to being education, then
 status competitions thrive - since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 could be substituted with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Note that if being educated drives both subsistence and bliss level utilities,
 then a perfect segregation might exist between those that are educated
 and the uneducated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can summarise the above discussion in two claims that follow from the
 above model of heterogeneity in prices.
 This motivates our discussion for the econometric analyses of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Claim 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The significance of demographic characteristics (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) for bliss levels but not on subsistence levels is a precondition for status
 competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Claim 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status competitions are spurred as bliss becomes expensive and subsistence
 becomes cheaper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish the first claim, we only need to see that in an economy where
 subsistence is sensitive to a certain demographic characteristic (class,
 race, region, educational attainment etc.), the role of the demographic
 vector becomes too important

 The only way for an individual to change one's fortunes may be to change
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 by moving residence or getting an education).
 The status from consumption itself could hardly achieve much when two 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 values as segregated if there were two different economies.
 On the other hand, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 drives bliss but not subsistence (
\begin_inset Formula $a(p)$
\end_inset

 doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p,\rho)$
\end_inset

 does), then changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 might have the same effect as increasing the total outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the contribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to utility could be substituted with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 A perfect segregation based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 could also result when the same value of demographic vector is significant
 for both bliss and subsistence.
 Indeed not having any demographic characteristic relevant to either bliss
 or subsistence means a rather equal society where status differences may
 not have much value.
 It is only when bliss is sensitive to a demographic vector while subsistence
 isn't that status competitions can be participated in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second claim is easily verfied with the observation that the needs for
 status are always secondary to basic needs.
 In an economy where subsistence is more expensive but bliss isn't, the
 competition for basic needs may be too crowded or the general perception
 of what is basic may be too high (in terms of cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

).
 Thus status competitions are discouraged when everyone struggles to keep
 up the minimum-costs necessary in this economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The claims demonstrate how the savings rate at the subsistence and bliss
 levels (cross sensitivity between 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the cost-function formulation) could depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The formulation thus allows one to test how the particular demographic
 characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - in addition to the life-cycle effects- also influence whether consumers
 care more about 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 at subsistence levels and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 at bliss levels or not.
 Here the claim from a PIH perspective 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that the utility per unit of money of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is higher when 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is low (i.e.
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is more important to a consumer when she is poorer and has a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 ) might no longer hold when local effects due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 dominate permanent ownership (savings) and consumption of quality (through
 heterogeneity of prices).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above dynamics motivate the analysis of LSMS panel data on consumption
 for Tanzania (years 2010, 2012 and 2014).
 We use an estimation based on the dependence of budget ratios 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu},w_{A}$
\end_inset

 (which are price-sensitivities of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(c(u,\textbf{p}))$
\end_inset

 on observed prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A},P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 across the variations of age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and demographic characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to understand the variation in permanent ownership and quality consumption.
 We find that this variation in the economy provides a better picture of
 status consumption in the developing economy than the rush for visible
 goods.
 The results from a quantile regressions explaining the variation in consumer
 response to the prices (of quality and permanent owership) across income
 or education quantiles of the population follow in the subsequent sections.

Cost of Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input for the cost of needs is the diary of food items and the recall
 diary for upto one year.
 The consumption of the items that are considered necessities is calculated
 for the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 The cost of needs thus calculated in this manner (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) depend on the particular locality where the household is located.
 Given the categories of consumption in Tanzania i.e.
 food, household, energy and transport, we calculate the cost of basic needs
 as the cost of minimal requirements in every category.
 As an example, we use the commodity sub-groups of carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables in the food category.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - which is composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - are then calculated in each region and district based
 on the prices of the items recorded in the survey (which records the prices
 at the district level as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket could be a
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - as these are most often
 the cheapest items in their respective sub-group (
\begin_inset Formula ${carb,fact,protein,fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the cost of this basket thus calculated is much higher
 in the urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 The cost thus calculated is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the food component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al

For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 The costs of clothing in the region for a particular year are included
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The running costs of the house - depending on whether it's owned or rented
 are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 When the house is rented, the running costs are simply the reported rent
 on the house whereas when the house is owned by the household, a 2.5% of
 the cost of the house is used (the maintenance rate is estimated based
 on the expenditure reported in the survey for the houses that report maintenanc
e on the owned house) .
 The matching of need with the level of durable goods owned is similar to
 how the energy costs are set up based on the type of durable good one possesses.

Under transport category, the public-transport costs and petrol consumption

 Thus, a user of electricity does not have much signaling advantage when

 In terms of the model, the user of electricity may indicate a higher status

 electrical items rather than the consumption (part of

[CALCULATING QUALITY] The non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$

 is seen as the sum of the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 The quality chosen by the consumer is thus the needs-adusted difference
 between her reported non-durable consumption and the cost of needs (evaluated
 locally at the district level in the data)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that relying only on the total costs associated with a commodity
 (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality or 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
cannot differentiate between the consumption of a higher quantity and of
 a higher quality.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 for a commodity priced 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$
\end_inset

, then our quality metric for the consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

).
 That said, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity
 are available in the region or not, it is possible to draw conclusions
 about over-consumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity (more so when a pseudo-panel analysis
 is used).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The reference point of needs is crucial to our notion of quality as it
 is simply a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 For food commodities, standardising a set of needs general across the populatio
n is relatively easy - as the cost of needs in food would simply be the
 cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs, fruits etc.

 in this particular example.
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{R'}<\Psi_{R}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{R'}>c_{t}-\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

) .
 But does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 Not only is it that the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity groups
 (over energy or durable goods for example).
 In fact, there is little sense in claiming that the quality in one commodity
 can be substituted with quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality is meaningful only with the consideration of
 a total cost of basic needs level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The notion of excess - subject to such a level - is thus the only a way
 to assess overall quality in non-durable consumption.
 Thus if having a refrigerator is not considered a need, then we may say
 nothing more than that 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

.
 By avoiding counting maintenance costs in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, we merely maintain the same interpretation
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is possible that ownership of some durable goods generates some rental
 income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, such income would be considered an additional stream of income instead
 of reduction in the cost

\end_inset

.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical method for adjusting necessities based on the durable goods
 one possesses is straightforward if we assume a typical usage for all expensive
 durable goods owned.
 If a household possesses a car, then the needs of the household would be
 incremented with the petrol consumption per year and maintenance for a
 typical usage.
 This also means that some costs of needs (e.g.
 for food) are multiplied by the number of household members in the family
 while other needs aren't - as we obtain the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for a particular household (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classification of long-term durable goods is based on intergenerational
 transfers i.e.
 an item is included in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and thus its cost of maintenance are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) only if it can be passed on through generations.
 The durable goods that cannot be passed through generations are not considered
 long-term and excluded from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (this is due to the life-cycle considerations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since social characteristics are acquired over a life-time and often require
 some investment (e.g.
 education fees or club-membership fees), one could - from a rather theoretical
 standpoint - treat such social characteristics too as durable-good.
 Although we do treat education as a personal characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 in our analyses, the case could be made for education to be treated as
 a long-term durable good as well (which is valid for an inter-generational
 transfer, requires a long investment over time and has a certain value
 in the employment market).
 While such a consideration is not prevented in the model for consumer choice,
 we do impose the condition that for a long-term choice (such as committing
 to the education of one's progeny) to be considered part of the durable
 goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the costs of maintenance (e.g.
 school fees) associated with the durable-goods should be included in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 If not, then such a long-term choice - improves one's relative positioning
 directly and must be considered as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (moving residence or entering a new social network are such examples).
 In other words, education could be treated as a durable good in the regular
 sense only as long as an educated individual is required to pay definite
 maintenance costs for having been educated.

Durable goods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey includes everything from
 a mobile phone to land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 The details of records include the number of durable goods owned by the
 household, the reported cost at which the durable good was purchased and
 the price the household expects by selling the durable good in the market
 at the time of the survey.
 While these data fields are promising for the intertemporal setting we
 wish to make use of, some refinement of this data is necessary due to the
 measurement errors with the costs and the current price (the latter is
 referred to as marked-to-market average or mtm average in the current discussio
n).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue with the reported cost is typical of those based on a consumer
 recall.
 Recorded by the survey at two time-points spread across two years (let's
 call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs may change over a period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) may be significantly different from the cost recorded in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 To some extent, the reported cost of the durable goods follows the mtm
 average which itself is less susceptible to the issue as it is not recalled
 from consumer's memory and reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable
 good over time instead.
 The mtm average of the durable goods (like the cost of the durable good)
 is a value averaged over the number of durable goods owned by consumer.
 Therefore, the cost incurred by the purchase of a new durable good - that
 we're interested in - is not directly observed in the mtm average and relies
 on the field indicating number of durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the value of new purchases relies on the number of durable goods observed
 in the survey, we detect an durable good purchase only when a difference
 in the number of durable goods over the successive years is observed.
 The difference between the mtm average is thus recorded as part of new
 durable goods only as long as we observe a difference in number of durable
 goods in the two-year period (i.e.
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 The number of durable goods observed however is also subject to some measuremen
t error and requires some further refinements for us to calculate the total
 cost of durable goods.
 That said, since we are interested in the the new durable good purchases
 for our analysis, someone buying their first music player is unlikely to
 make counting errors than someone adding to their collection of music systems.
 We thus look for significant changes in durable goods numbers (e.g.
 if they change from 0 to 1 or substantially 3 to 5 or to 6,7...
 etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible issue with a calculation of durable good cost changes as outlined
 above is that the measurement error with the number of durable goods may
 get magnified for more expensive durable goods such as house.
 However, since we also observe whether the individual owns a house or not
 from the household questionnaire (which records the housing-status through
 a direct question), we confirm that this error is not significant after
 reconciling the calculated differences with the data from the household
 questionnaire.
 What this reconciliation does remind us however is that the durable goods
 recorded in the survey indicate whether the household uses (or has access
 to) the durable goods rather than what it owns
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A lot of households in rented or employer-provided houses report having
 a house.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since rental options - except for housing - are fairly limited in the developin
g economies, this does not pose a significant measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final caveat for the data is the presence of split households.
 A significant portion of the households may split into two or more households.
 Considering a split household as the terminal state of a household, we
 don't consider the parent household while calculating durable good differences
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 if it has terminated in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, durable good net-differences are included only as long
 as the households have not split in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+1$
\end_inset

.
 As explained in the discussion of the model, we only wish to consider durable
 goods that can be potentially transferred over generations (it is easy
 to verify these when the households are split).
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data, we consider any durable good more expensive
 than bed as eligible to be transferred to the next generation.
 This can be verified with the data on split household.
 The durable goods in the survey that are not life-long durable goods e.g.
 mobile phones, dish-tv etc.
 are not considered in the net-durable good changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{\tau+1}=A_{\tau+1}-A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a median-cost order of the durable goods recorded in 2014).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For robustness tests to our conclusions, we attempt to both sharpen and
 smoothen the data on durable goods changes by considering purchases within
 coarser groups such as electronic items, furniture etc.
 and by turning off the effect of depreciation in the durable good difference
 calculation respectively.
 The first test to sharpen the data is with classification of new durable
 goods into coarser categories - which is useful in its own right in order
 to interpret the distribution of functional durable goods - since counting
 the instances of purchases of just any electronic item may make more sense
 than the purchase of individual items such as a music system or a CD player.
 The appeal of the grouping approach is also due the extreme differences
 in urban and rural markets in an economy like Tanzania.
 Grouping the durable goods into agricultural electronic, electric and livestock
 categories accentuates the minor additions to one's durable goods - by
 giving the cheaper durable goods purchased by the consumer the same treatment
 as the more expensive durable goods.
 The downside with such a grouping is of course this very collation of durable
 goods with vast differences in prices within a single group (cd-player
 and music system for example may have vast differences in prices but could
 be counted as a new electronic durable good purchased).
 As our primary intention has been to get the total durable goods costs
 we have refrained from using such grouping as a primary means of analyses.

\begin_layout Standard
The method to smoothen the data on the other hand has clear advantages.
 As we have noted earlier, in every two years of the survey, the mtm-average
 by the household is susceptible to both how the household interviewee may
 estimate the change in the market and whether the interviewee from the
 household in a particular year is different from the interviewee household
 member in another year.
 The durable goods data can thus be smoothened by separating the effect
 of these factors if we can consider only only one year's prices.
 To explain this with an example, consider an durable good 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 whose value is 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the reported average mtm of the durable good at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of durable goods the household possesses.
 To avoid the measurement error associated with the difference in the estimate
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, we prefer to use the mtm-average estimate (price) at either from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the difference in cost of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 could be either be 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}P_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t}P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 Choosing the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 however leads us to another issue due to the sparsity of data.
 As we rely on a district-level granularity of data, not only would we not
 have the price reported for an item not owned by the consumer in period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, there may not be enough purchases in the district for us to estimate the
 cost of the item that consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One way to circumvent this is to classify all durable goods into cheap,
 middle-range and expensive categories based on cost quantiles in the period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and then determine the category of the durable good purchased in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 based on its price in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 The price at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would then by the price of matching category (expensive, middle-range or
 cheap) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Since, we may as well use the price at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, this indirect methods is rendered unnecessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As we're interested in the price for the new purchases (i.e.
 cases such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}>0$
\end_inset

), the prices at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset

) do not suffer with this issue.
 The expenditure on new durable goods calculated is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Delta n_{a,t+1}=P_{a,t+1}(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 a quantity that considers an mtm change less affected by the measurement
 error in the estimate provided by the household member interviewee.

The typical life-cycle consumption patterns can be confirmed with the significan
ce of age-related coefficients.
 More particularly, the quality (excess) consumption seems to decline with
 age while durable good purchases do not seem to be influenced by age as
 much.
 Apart from the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and needs, the disposable income (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

) also depends on the durable goods someone owns through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which includes durable good-bearing costs).
 Thus a weak significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 simultaneously with a strong significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 implies a stronger effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that have much influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (durable goods such as land that do not require a high maintenance cost
 proportional to their cost are purchased less often than those that have
 higher bearing costs).
 Further, the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 is negative while it is positive for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that higher disposable income (lower needs or higher income)
 is more often associated with higher quality (excess) and less durable
 good purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is statistically weak, but the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is quite significant.
 More durable goods purchases are made by those who are already rich in
 relative terms, the new durable goods purchased are mostly those that are
 associated with high running costs.
 While the distribution of wealth - reflected in the ownership of expensive
 durable goods such as a house or land - do determine which consumers purchase
 new durable goods, the significance of disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

 (shown as lt1 in the table) - which we estimate using occupation, education
 and needs over the years 2012 and 2014 - and its negative coefficient for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 indicates that the new durable goods are purchased by those with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which is inclusive of durable goods bearing costs) and/or the new durable
 good purchases are by those who have relatively less incomes (
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$

Unlike the ownership of durable good such as land and housing, disposable
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the sort of wealth that lends to more social mobility.
 The educated and the highly-paid may pass on their skills and social networks
 to the progeny, but the transfer of such soft-durable goods to the next
 generation is more dissipative than the monetary wealth.
 Such soft-assets might not result in the ownership of more expensive durable
 goods (such as housing or land) but these do require consumption on education
 and social functions anyways.
 The durable good purchases may suggest the limits of the durable goods
 purchases.
 This is made clearer with the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for expenditure on quality(

excess

) consumption indicates.
 Those with less durable goods but with better income do seem to spend more
 on quality (including education).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in urban and rural lifestyles also play a role in the difference
 in durable good purchases as well as quality.
 This is in particular due to the the availability of electricity being
 limited to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for and more likely to
 deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.

There is a need to exercise caution in the interpretation of the tobit /
 OLS results using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which - in econometric terms - is treated as a proxy for prices, regional
 variations, age and the effects of wealth.
 To allow our conclusions to be more robust, it may be worthwhile to to
 decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 into more control variables - possibly by reformulating the model in the

 and

 to employ a quantile regression based on age, income, durable good costs
 - while still maintaining the key purpose of the model which is to separate
 means of income from wealth in an analysis of the intertemporal substitution
 between durable good purchases and quality (excess) under a life-cycle
 setting.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption in an environment of uneven prices for relative quality.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived risk in one's stability of wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the the participants exhibiting a risk-seeking
 behaviour (i.e.
 a disproportionate expenditure) towards goods and services that may lead
 to a large payoff (immense success) with a small probability (through joining
 golf clubs, engaging in social events - status competitions with a small
 upfront cost).
 This may serve as a refinement to the conventional assumptions of a balance
 between the urban and rural prices in the models that explore rural migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While visible items do capture such risk-seeking behaviours in the developed
 economies very well, the difference in wealth and the segregation of quality
 of life in the developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they
 may be in segregated societies in the developed economies).
 Without a
\bar under
 
\bar default
consideration of how the durable goods are distributed in the economy and
 are subject to change, one must be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed this is not to say that the consumption on items that are categorically
 visible does not tell us much about the demand in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption - and is worth exploring in its own right - but
 if one were to develop a theory of status consumption instead of revisiting
 visible consumption in varied cultural contexts in this manner, the considerati
ons of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership seem an obvious
 first step.
 Indeed in the particular case of marriages too, we would only improve our
 understanding of the bride price if we realise that marriages are both
 an indication of one's social status as well as a potential for advancement
 in social ranking - forces that are at play in durable goods purchases
 more generally in much the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the literature on rural and urban differences in the developing
 world should be extended to include status consumption on grounds of generality.
 The context of status consumption varies significantly across economies
 and one often needs to make adjustments for the particular social conditions
 to draw conclusions on visible consumption.
 Using an intertemporal behavioural model to explain consumption may help
 us in standardising the markets for status in disparate economies and help
 us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across the various states of economies.
