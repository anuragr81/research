\begin_layout Abstract
The economies in sub-Saharan Africa witness high unemployment and significant
 wealth effects that limit access to higher education.
 The current study compares the importance of wealth effects in Tanzania
 and Nigeria for education expenses across varied levels of urbanisation,
 access to secondary education and household permanent income in the two
 countries.
 While the differences in education expenses are in part due to idiosyncratic
 factors such as social and institutional structures in the two economies,
 the extremity of wealth effects in the poorer economy suggests that a rise
 in urbanisation may act to reduce the relevance of wealth in educational
 attainment in the region.

 They point out that education is available more widely in the urban than
 in the rural areas of many developing countries.
 When education is publicly funded and funding is regionally decentralized,
 we would expect the extent of educational provi- sion in a region to depend
 on its income.
 A prosperous region can afford to devote more resources to education; unless
 it is cross-subsidized, a poor region can afford less.
 Given a high urbanrural income disparity, the more rural regions are at
 an educational disadvantage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 24.1.2.1.
 In market economies, households with more income demand more education
 as a consumption good.
 Second, given capital market imperfections richer households can better
 afford to invest in education.
 For instance, the foregone earnings cost may bear more heavily on poor
 households.
 Third, richer households may have the knowledge, the contacts or the complement
ary resources which raise the rate of return to education for them.
 For these reasons we expect household income and the educational attainment
 of children to be positively related in countries with predominantly private
 educational systems.
 Thus, rural-urban income disparities can also generate educational disparities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 24.1.2.2.
 In state education economies, the children of educated parents may be at
 a competitive advantage not only because they tend to inherit greater natural
 ability but also because they have better opportunities to acquire out-of-schoo
l human capital.
 For instance, they may receive more stimulus from the household environment,
 absorb more favourable attitudes and have better access to books or to
 electric light for evening study.
 In this way educational inequalities can be transmitted from one generation
 to another.

 TilakDeterminantsHouseholdexpenditureinRuralIndia2002 - also finds that

 They argue that one cannot assume the education is free - because the poor
 do spend high amounts on education (if not on fees then a lot of other
 related expenses).
 This is a social cost therefore.
 Tilak goes on to discuss -  why households invest in education.
 First, education is not sufficiently free from the govt.
 Second, they believe that high fees means high efficiency.
 They're also interested in whether education is  a superior good or not.
 They find that at an all India level, household expenditures on education
 are less elastic to changes in household income.
 They find that Muslims do not spend as much on education.
 They find that differences by occupational groups in household expenditures
 on education in government and government-aided private schools are not
 high; but they are high in private schools.
 The parental education level does matter significantly in the rural areas.
 They also use a village-development-index (which is meant to correspond
 to higher educexp).

%[DEMAND Question] - Wealth effects are like gravity for education attainment
 - but leaving pointing to a general relevance of social factors is not
 an option.
 Given that we consider both Nigeria and Tanzania (focusing on NGR alone
 is an option), the urbanisation - which is a major supply side issue -
 should be seen highlighted as a measure that compares with the direct measure
 of educational institutitions are spread in the country.
 Only thing that is important is the wealth effect - which has two effects
 - quality of education and social exclusion.
 We don't have a measure for quality - so we focus only on higher expenditure
  on education after controlling for non-durable consumption prices in the
 region (i.e.
 if consumer spend more on education with respect to other non-durable expenditu
re relative to non-durable expenditure).
 The second issue is to understand if wealth may be limited access to higher
 levels of education.
 The lower demand for education could either be due to low returns to education
 or due to wealth limiting access.
 As returns to education is not availalbe to us, we are interested only
 if wealth is preventing access and therefore causes some degree of social
 exclusion both through wealth (price of education and wealth) and social
 factors relevant to wealth.

 The low participation has been attributed both an insufficient focus on

 education facilities may be a important concern than returns to education
 in less urbanised areas of SSA.
 To examine the role of urbanisation amidst low education access, we compare
 the educational expenditure in Tanzania and Nigeria - selected as two represent
ative countries in the SSA with different levels of urbanisation and dependence
 on agrarian production.
 The study finds wealth effects for education to be more severe in less
 urbanised areas - with the urbanisation levels measured as spatial distribution
 of wealth in the respective countries.

While the role of urban-rural disparities in education expenditures has
 been highlighted in many empirical studies from SSA (

LatexCommand cite
key "BayarDeterminantsEducTurkey2016,KnightEducationalattainmentRuralUrbanChina1996,AcarHHEducTurkey2016"

 opportunities in the SSA rather than broad or implicit urban-rural classificati

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AbayYoungRuralEconomy2021,WigginsProctorRuralUrban2001"

\end_inset

).
 As such, the urban-rural disparities may influence participation in education
 through various mechanisms.
 The foremost mechanism is the physical access to education facilities -
 since education is more widely available in urban areas due to the sparse
 economic development in the developing economies.
 This disparity may be made worse with decentralised funding for education
 in the economies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KnightEducationalattainmentRuralUrbanChina1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The other mechanism is the relative abundance of opportunities for higher
 income employment in urban areas that make education more affordable.
 Thus the rural households may consistently underinvest in education due
 to their lower incomes.
 Lastly, the social environment of the urban areas may also differ from
 that of the rural areas - an effect that may overweigh other factors if
 segregation based on social identities or characteristics is significant
 in the economy.

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to distinguish between the effects of urbanisation effects
 and the localised effects of wealth distribution in a given area - as the
 poorer households can still be at an educational disadvantage even if they
 reside in affluent urban areas.
 To be specific, the effect of household wealth on education expenditures
 implies the extent to which education may favour the wealthy households
 at the point of use.
 These effects - referred to as wealth effects - are also found significant
 in the empirical studies from SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Other than through costs (such as transportation) imposed on households
 when education access is poorer, wealth can influence access to education
 through other channels - such as information symmetries that could help
 for future job-searches, a better representation in nascent political instituti
ons of a developing economy and the social characteristics that align with
 higher local (relative) wealth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As higher intergenerational wealth may help fund higher levels of education,
 the wealth inequalities within a particular locality can easily turn into
 educational inequalities by creating a poverty trap for the lower-income
 households (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This has been an important concern for policy in SSA due to a large informal
 sector and the higher consequent income volatility that tends to deprioritise
 education expenditure for poorer households (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011,MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

 The wealth effects also get worse at higher levels of education as the
 foregone labour income through time spent in education becomes costlier
 for households with low possessions or wealth.

The presented chapter details the effects of urbanisation against the wealth
 effects using a category-based as well as a spatial interpretation of urbanisat
ion.
 The spatial interpretation of urbanisation is based on the average local
 wealth possession in the area where the household resides.
 Referred to as wealth-concentration in the rest of the chapter, the measure
 proxies the concentration of asset-ownership across an economy and provides
 a continuous - rather than categorical - variable for urbanisation levels.
 The empirical analysis also ensures that the measurements for physical
 access to education, the relative effects of wealth and that of urbanisation
 are measured at the same geographical scale.
 This scale - set to a 6-

 the geographical distances between districts and the average distance to

An important control for comparing the role of urbanisation is the effect
 of access to education facilities.
 Since poor education access also make the wealth effects appear stronger
 (due to higher transportation costs etc.), the disparity of education opportunit
ies or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

physical access
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a necessary control for the comparison of wealth effects against urbanisatio
n effects.
 The control plays a critical role in determining whether a given set of
 funds are more appropriately used to build accessible schools or to support
 and economise education instead.
 More specifically, if physical access for education is what prevents the
 attainment of education, then building more schools becomes of higher priority.
 On the other hand, if wealth effects are stronger in the economy, then
 affordability of education becomes an important issue - even if returns
 to education were a cause of concern.
 Whether returns to education are enough to increase education participation
 for lower-income households or not is often conditioned on there being
 less significant wealth effects and sufficient physical access to education
 in an economy (

As we have argued earlier, the social environment of a household may also
 favour its participation in education.
 While the effects of discernible factors such as segregation or exclusion
 base on social identities education have been often highlighted in SSA
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011"

 present a more challenging task to the empirical studies.
 Early attempts to explain the role of social factors have advanced the
 notion of social capital (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BourdieuCulturalRepr2018"

\end_inset

) - encompassing habits, preferences and behaviour cultivated in richer
 environments that affect future educational mobility.
 Some empirical studies have found - for example - that certain environmental
 factors - such as the feedback for improvement of students or the subjective
 evaluations of students - may be more supportive for households that exhibit
 a

 (

 It is often possible to identify schooling-related or parental factors
 that help increase participation in education or assist in employment opportuni
ties therefore but there treatment of social capital as equivalent of physical
 capital poses a significant empirical issue (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SobelSocialCapital2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since the measures for social capital cannot be nearly as universal as
 the measures for acquired wealth, the recent studies on social capital
 have focused on precise notions of how social interactions may influence
 household decisions (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Manski2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In the context of education, the empirical studies have explored the non-transa
ctional role which social capital might play in educational participation
 and mobility (

 , for example, point out that higher educated parents invariably spend
 more time with children - a social factor that contributes to how parental
 education levels influence the next generation.
 In another study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DeGraafParentalCulturalCapital2000"

 find that it is the reading habits among the richer households rather than
 high-culture-participation itself that affects school performance in Netherland
s.
 In particular, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeGraafParentalCulturalCapital2000"

\end_inset

 argue that it is possible to explain a significant part of parental social
 background with explicit measures of resources accessible to the students.
 In fact, the high-culture does not even always influence educational performanc
e positively.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 negatively in South Korea as it takes time off from study.
 In most cases, therefore, the cultural factors matter in education only
 through economic factors that are relevant for participation.

\begin_layout Standard
In the current study, the relevant notion of social capital encompasses
 the acquisition of skills from parents or from the social environment (networks
) that are valued in the employment markets and at higher levels of education.
 The parental educational levels - which are widely observed to have a significa
nt effect on education attainment in the developing economies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TanselParentEducEffects1997"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - are the first important control in the consideration of social capital.
 One could argue - from a human capital perspective - that the effect of
 parental education levels is not unlike the effect of wealth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "WuZhangUnequalEduc2008,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999,GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,SpaullPovertyEducSA2013"

) since both accumulations are transferred to further generations (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BeckerTomesEquilibMobility1979"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This is admissible since while social capital is hardly equivalent to physical
 capital, the investments in education are not fundamentally apart from
 investments towards physical capital and can be compared with other household
 expenditures.
 The main occupation in the household is the other important factor that
 may favour participation in education.
 More particularly, the agrarian or non-agrarian nature of the household
 occupation in a largely agrarian economy may indicate a non-transactional
 advantage for individuals through the social networks they acquire.
 The use of occupation as a control allows also allows us to test - for
 example - if it is more often that the non-agrarian workers treat education
 as a basic need for the occupations they aim for (all else being the same)
 or if it is the poorer sections instead who spend more on education (when
 accessible) viewing it as the only way out of poverty(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakDeterminantsHouseholdexpenditureinRuralIndia2002"

\end_inset

).
 Other household characteristics of social significance that influence participa
tion in education may vary across different economies.
 In Tanzania, for example, the speakers of English language seem to be generally
 more educated and have higher incomes.
 The ability to speak English could indicate an exposure to education in
 ways that the poorer or rural households may not be exposed.
 The religious identities also have some implications for participation
 in education in countries such as Nigeria (

An essential claim of the human capital theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - which the empirical literature on determinants of education expenditure
 often relies on - is that the educational investments must change over
 the life cycle of consumers.
 The current chapter takes advantage of the reporting of household expenditures
 on education at individual level in the surveys for both the countries
 and considers how the education expenditure may vary with the age of the
 children in the household.
 The variables for childrens' ages are important for our comparison also
 because the education expenditures for a population where the majority
 joins the workforce after attaining primary education would be very different
 from one where the employment opportunities are higher for educated individuals.
 Since large households have different standards for basic needs than smaller
 households, we also consider the number of children as another relevant
 control that is closely related with lifecycle concerns.
 It is worth highlighting that while one may expect the household expenses
 on education to decline with the rise in number children due to a higher
 cost pressures, studies often find that education enrollments to rise instead
 of decline with the number of children in some sub-Saharan African countries

It is also worth reiterating how a particular sense of urbanisation helps
 us separate the effects of wealth concentration from the social factors
 we have identified above.
 The measure of wealth-concentration as inter-generational long-term assets
 quantifies urban-rural disparities and allows us to assess the extent to
 which a higher wealth concentration may provide a more supportive environment
 for education participation after accounting for the effects of wealth,
 occupation in the household, the physical access in the region (the district
 boundary in a 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km^{2}$
\end_inset

area) and other factors of social significance.
 The particular interpretation of urbanisation is based on suggestions to
 consider spatial distribution of assets in the recent literature - which
 has emphasised the network of occupations and contractual relationships
 surrounding the ownership of land or natural resources in SSA (

The two economies in SSA that we have selected for our comparison of education
 expenditure have different levels of economic development and a different
 degree of dependence on agrarian output.
 More particularly, Nigeria relies more heavily on energy exports while
 Tanzania's economy is more reliant on its agricultural output - a difference
 that is critical for the varied level of urbanisation in the two economies.
 While the educational attainments in the populations of the two countries
 are evidently shaped by the idiosyncrasies of the policy and distinct social
 factors, the varying levels of urbanisation in the two economies allow
 us to explore the challenges that improvement of employment opportunities
 and economic development may bring towards access to education in the region.
 More particularly, if wealth effects matter less in the urbanised areas
 i.e.
 if education is more egalitarian for residents in the urban areas (after
 controlling for physical access), then the policy may not need to focus
 on wealth effects and direct the attention to improving access elsewhere
 instead.
 On other hand, if wealth effects are significant despite higher economic
 development in urbanised regions, then more attention is needed for improvement
 of access to education for lower-income households.

To summarise the variables discussed so far, we treat the wealth of the
 household and the urbanisation levels as the main explanatory variables
 in our comparison of educational expenditures while the physical access
 to education, the social or demographic factors and the household characteristi
cs serve as important controls in the analysis.
 The first explanatory variable i.e.
 the wealth the permanent income or wealth of the household uses either
 the total expenditure of the household or the total value of long-term
 assets owned by the household.
 The use of total expenditure as permanent income is common in studies on
 consumption and relies on standard consumption theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 The use of wealth-indices based on the stock of durable goods (excluding
 short-term durable goods that are not transferred over a generation) is
 also common in the studies from health and household economics (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "HoweHargreavesWealthIndices2008,HoweHargreavesWealthIndexComparison2010,McKenzie2005,BooysenVanderbergAssetIndex2008"

\end_inset

).
 Instead of using income-data, the empirical studies for education more
 often rely on the data on ownership of assets (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - since the inter-generational transfers of wealth are what make a break
 in the inequality gap (i.e.
 mobility through reduction of wealth differences) difficult (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ObasuyiEducationInequality2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 We compare the use of both assets-measure (as the logarithm of owned assets
 or durable goods) and the permanent income (based on the logarithm of total
 expenditure) as measures of wealth in the current study.
 When using assets-measure, we use the urban-rural indicator from the survey
 as the second explanatory variables while the wealth-concentration measure
 is used as the second explanatory variable when using the permanent income
 measure (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The urban-rural indicators are normalised into a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ruralness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 score based on the record of urban-rural wards in surveys for the two economies
 and the wealth-concentration measure is calculated as the average asset-ownersh
ip levels in the households' vicinity.
 Thus, the urbanisation levels are also measured in two different ways and
 correspond to the two measures for wealth.
 The first measure of urbanisation is based on a ruralness score that is
 assigned to a district based on the number of wards (that a district is
 composed of) declared as rural in the survey.
 The second measure of urbanisation uses the measure of wealth (assets)
 concentration in the consumer's vicinity.
 Notice that the population density based approaches have been avoided in
 the study due to issues arising of densely populated rural areas in SSA
 economies (

).
 Also, further robustness checks redefine the wealth concentration measures
 by varying the definitions of households vicinity and considering the household
's neighborhood of similar occupations (agrarian/non-agrarian) and education
 ranks (primary,secondary).
 Note also that the physical access control is based on the number of secondary
 schools in every district.
 More specifically, a higher score of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 means more secondary schools in a district.

 However, as the study is concerned only with the relative importance of
 urbanisation and permanent income measures in the two countries - rather
 than the elasticities of expenditure, the endogeneity issues are less relevant
 to the comparison of household educational expenditure.
 Note also that the issues of intra-household allocation of educational
 expense among children are not relevant to our cross-section analysis.
 It is worth highlighting also that the disparity in quality is out of scope

The main finding from the current study is that high urbanisation is correlated
 with lower severity of wealth effects in the two economies.
 The higher urbanisation - which may depend on the country's governmental
 efficiency, natural resources or fiscal condition - does seem to reduce
 the wealth effects on education.
 Despite the peculiarities of inequality in SSA such as high land-labour
 ratios and sparse distribution of economic resources (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersoninequalityandvariableSAA2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the weakening of wealth effects with rising urbanisation points in a
 promising direction and marks the success of past policies that have helped
 improve the access to education in the region.
 The study also finds that the segregation of education opportunities and
 the disparities in future employment opportunities across the country are
 more evident in Tanzania where the differences between urban and rural
 prosperity seems more extreme.
 The other side of these seemingly desirable effects of urbanisation, therefore,
 is that the need to improve to education participation in less urbanised
 areas remains a significant challenge for policy.
 The recommendations for addressing non-formal education and improving basic
 education for rural populations may therefore be an important concern for
 an education policy when urbanisation is not easy to achieve for an economy.

There current chapter contributes to the literature on determinants of education
 in two different ways.
 First, it demonstrates that the despite the challenges of urban overpopulation,
 the effect of urbanisation may be desirable one for the households due
 to the extremity of differences in lifestyle between rural and urban areas.
 This may support the conventional view that despite the evident problems
 with rise in inequality, the urbanisation may play a key role in economic
 growth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KuznetsEconomicGrowthIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 More particularly, the weakening in severity of wealth effects with the
 rise in urbanisation could indicate the pathways to future improvements
 in income equality and reduction in education inequality.
 The second contribution of the chapter is the delineation of links between
 levels of economic activity and parental education - which we perform consideri
ng the spatial concentration of wealth and education across the two economies.
 While most of the literature we have surveyed has focused on the urban-rural
 dichotomy, we rely on a spatial distribution of wealth to examine the specific
 link between wealth-concentration, occupational levels and education expenses
 in the region.

While education may not be considered a basic necessity in all poverty-measureme
nt surveys, it is seldom disputed that a lack of education contributes to
 poverty.
 Even in the developing economies, the poorest individuals might have a
 strong demand for education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002,GertlerGlewwe1990WTPEduc"

 The literature suggests that when education is not state-funded in the
 developing economies, there might be a compulsion - rather than a mere
 willingness - to pay for education among the poor (

 With a high demand for educated workforce in an industrialising economy,
 there seems little disagreement in policy- either from a human capital
 perspective (

An important consideration for education attainment is that while higher
 education does provide skills for higher incomes, the access to education
 tends to be often limited by the wealth one possesses.
 The differences in education elasticities based on income have been highlighted
 in the early literature from mid-last century (

 The empirical studies from the SSA have also reported significant wealth
 effects on education (

While the wealth-effects remain significant in SSA, the there are other
 reasons offered for the high unemployment among graduates and a relatively
 low participation of higher education in SSA.
 On one hand, the institutional issues and mismanagement in public education
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) have been held responsible for insufficient gains in economic growth from
 education - but on the other, an excessive focus on formal education in
 an informal economy is also criticised for being misguided (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The concerns for returns-to-education - however - need to be viewed in
 the context of wealth effects and the issue of availability of schools
 in the economies of SSA.
 More specifically, it is possible that the demand for education is suppressed
 due to inadequate income (relatively high prices of education) in the economy
 or a sparse distribution of education opportunities rather than due to
 lower returns from post-education employment opportunities alone (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 If education expenditures are better explained with physical access, then
 the policy may need to focus on building more accessible schools whereas
 if wealth-effects are more significant, then there is a need to make education
 more affordable for the lower-income households.
 In the context of SSA, the empirical studies more often find the physical
 access to be less significant than the wealth effects (

LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,KambonBusbyEducationPoverty2000,ObasuyiEducationInequality2019"

 That said, the effects of physical access evidently become stronger at
 higher (secondary and tertiary) levels of education (

 The effect of urban-rural differences on education participation are also

The attributions to various causes for inadequacies of education policy
 do not appear contrasting in the context of SSA - since both the pro-rich
 nature of education and an insufficient focus on industrial productivity
 can together contribute to lower participation rates and limited gains
 in productivity from education.
 In many economies of SSA, a dual-model (

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the late last century - but it has had limited success in improving
 the access to higher education for the poor or providing useful skills
 in the informal economy.
 The structural problems which the region faces have important implications
 for economic growth that cannot be addressed by a sound education policy
 alone.
 More specifically, the high-land labour ratios could strain growth in the
 region (

 Similarly, the susceptibility to commodity price volatilities (

 Further, the political powers bestowed upon the lower-income workforce

The goal of our empirical analysis is to find out if with rise in industrial
 development and urbanisation, the wealth effects better explain the disparity
 in education expenses rather than urbanisation levels in the two economies.
 As mentioned earlier, we use two measures for urbanisation levels - wealth-conc
entration and urban-rural indicators.
 Of these, the wealth concentration measure is calculated as the average
 assets in the consumer's district (for smaller districts, the average over
 multiple districts within a 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km^{2}$
\end_inset

area is taken).
 For the measurement of wealth, we consider the permanent income measure
 as total expenditure and the wealth measured using durable goods in the
 survey.
 The measures for both wealth-concentration and household wealth thus rely
 on the market-value of durable goods (including land, housing) observe
 in the survey (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 It is worth highlighting that the durable goods are considered as part
 of the consumer wealth only if they are transferable over generations.
 In other words, the ownership of goods that won't last more than a lifetime
 enter as consumption for the household rather than assets contributing
 to intergenerational wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a simple econometric model, the representative household balances i)
 her consumption with ii) increasing expenditure on education for the children.
 The non-durable consumption that the consumer may spend on excludes the
 expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and non-durable consumption excluding assets-related-c
osts thus form the budget constraint for the econometric model.
 Note that the cross-sectional comparison of expenses from the last survey
 records does not consider the substitution with savings towards durable
 goods.

The econometric analysis is limited for households having one or more children.
 In other words, only households with at least one member with their age
 less than 18 are considered in the analysis.
 Since the households with lower working age are likely to have less accumulatio
ns as well as needs, the average paternal age in the household is also used
 as a control in the comparison.
 The number of children (household-size), the educational level of the parents,
 the accessibility of schools in the district and the social characteristics
 of the household such as religion and language spoken are other important
 controls used in the analyses.
 Notice that for the paternal educational levels, we use an educational
 rank that is standardised by differentiating between primary, secondary

The educational expenses and the non-asset related expenditures are obtained
 from the Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) which is conducted by
 the World Bank.
 The survey has been designed to assist understanding the links between
 asset ownership, community access (to market, schools), food prices and
 agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys from multiple countries is largely uniform in its
 data-model (fields) and is often georeferenced with a sufficiently wide-coverag
e in the country to allow a study of spatial variation in the observed variables.
 The years used for the analyses are the most recent years in the survey
 for Tanzania (2014) and Nigeria (2015) - i.e.
 the last waves available in the survey at the time of writing this chapter.

As described earlier, one of the interpretation of urbanisation is the wealth
 concentration - which is measured as the log-averages of the values of
 durable goods (calculated as per the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited, we focus on durable goods that can be transferred over a generation.
 For both Tanzania and Nigeria, we therefore included items as long-term
 assets only if they are costlier than furniture - which is the cheapest
 asset to be transferred between the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data for Tanzania.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts for the
 wider level consumer vicinity based on Euclidean distance.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards
 in the 6

The physical access to education is measured using the distance to the nearest
 secondary school.
 More specifically, a score secondary_schools for each district represents
 number of wards that have a secondary school within the 6-

\end_inset

 distance.
 A district with a higher score has more wards that have a secondary school
 in close vicinity (within 6-km distance).
 The score evidently factors in the high-population density in urban areas
 since densely populated districts would have more wards within the same
 geographical distance as a less populated district.

The next important control is the occupation of the households which is
 directly available for every individual in the survey.
 Whether an occupational sector is agriculture related or determined is
 based on the main occupation of household head.
 The number of children in the household, the ages of the children (and
 other members) are directly observed in the data.
 The paternal educational levels which are also an important control in
 the study are not based on education level of the household head.
 This is because a significant number of household units in both Tanzania
 and Nigeria are made up of joint families where the reported educational
 expenses correspond to the grandchildren of the household head (HH).
 To avoid letting the education levels point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and to the last generation where
 HH has younger children, we rely on the highest education rank in the paternal
 generation of the children recorded in the survey

To provide a uniform treatment to educational levels across both Tanzania

 to rank 2 for until the completion of primary education, to rank 3 for
 up to the secondary education level and to 4 for all higher education levels
 (higher-secondary, university etc.).

 For instance, the primary school leaving exam is taken at D7 in Tanzania
 and corresponds to the education rank 2 ; all standards above D7 correspond
 to the education rank 3 for Tanzania.
 Similar, P6 is the highest primary education level in Nigeria for consumers
 implies an education level above the rank 2 (corresponding to P6) in Nigeria.
 As access to private education may be significant in the urban-areas, we
 also use a control for private-education available in the survey.

The languages spoken (in Tanzania) and the religious-identity for household
 members - used as controls - are recorded at the individual's level in
 the survey data for the countries and are directly used as controls in
 the survey.
 To control for the price of consumption in the household's district, we
 also use the non-durable consumption averages excluding the costs associated
 with ownership of assets in the survey.
 This measurement of price is akin to the price-deflator (unit-value) methods
 used in the demand literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"

\end_inset

).
 The rationale for excluding costs associated with assets is that the costs
 of maintaining assets (fees, repair costs, usage costs etc.) are not levied
 on those who don't own the related assets and should not be included in
 the general price of non-durable consumption.

Of the two economies, a higher percent of the GDP comes from agricultural
 production in Tanzania.
 The per-capita GDP 2020 for Nigeria (2396.04 USD) is much higher than that
 of Tanzania (976.16 USD) (source World Bank).
 As of 2020, Nigeria had a population of 206.1 million and Tanzania's population
 was 59.7 million (source: World Bank).
 The GDP from manufacturing, mining and construction is nearly double for
 Nigeria (8749.61 million USD in 2022) compared to Tanzania (4221.41 million
 USD in 2021).
 Nigeria's GDP from agriculture is 9311.36 million USD and Tanzania's is
 4313.47 million USD.
 Some structural differences and the differences in infrastructure in the
 two economies arise due to higher reliance on energy exports for Nigeria
 - which, as of 2020, exports $35.9 billion crude-gas and imports $7.75 billion
 of refined Petroleum apart from cars ($3.03 billion) and wheat ($2 billion).
 On the other hand, Tanzania's major exports are Gold and other minerals
 ($3 billion) followed by agricultural products (0.594$ billion).
 The major imports of Tanzania are refined copper and petroleum ($2.2B).
 Among the two economies, Nigeria relies less on the agrarian exports and
 more on the energy-related infrastructure - likely accounting for higher
 average education levels in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HistEducationRanks"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 The role of private education is also much higher in Nigeria (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

The urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in both the economies.
 More specifically, urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents
 in Nigeria whereas they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for education rank 3 is almost double that
 of the expenditure on education rank 2 in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these expenditures rise by about 54%.
 The educational expenses do not seem to rise much with asset disparities
 in Nigeria - whereas they seem to be more unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing the overall distribution of assets (durable goods stocks), we
 see that while the overall poverty may appear similar in Nigeria and Tanzania,
 the disparity in owned assets is far more extreme in Tanzania (particularly
 between the south of the country and the east - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"

 for Nigeria and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for Tanzania).
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"

) whereas the income-disparities in occupations and asset-differences appear
 less extreme in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The inequality in expenditure on non-durable consumption - on the other
 hand - is not as different for the two economies.
 This can be verified with the Lorenz curves for total non-durable expenditure
 and total assets in Figure

 (Nigeria) are based on the standardisation of various occupations in Tanzania
 and Nigeria.
 Since the range of occupations in the surveys from Tanzania and Nigeria
 is varied, the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria
 have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey so that
 a higher occupation rank represents an occupation that provides higher
 income.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and reporting of
 occupations in the surveys from both the countries

 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the key observation from the data is that the disparities in income and
 durable goods are more localised in Nigeria while they are more extreme
 across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai

 (see Figure

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, a significant number of household units in both the economies
 are made up of joint families where the reported educational expenses correspon
d to the grandchildren of the household head (HH).
 The education level of the HH would thus point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and the previous generation for
 younger households where HH has young children.
 To resolve this disparity, we avoid using the education rank of the HH
 and instead use the highest education rank in the generation of the students'
 parents

 instead.
 The paternal educational level

 suffices for the analysis of expenditure spent over all the children in
 the household (rather than how education budget is distributed among the
 children).

 The higher expenditure on education

 to higher consumption-prices - since the effect of

 As urbanisation must also raise the prices of non-durable expenditure excluding
 asset-costs

, the disparity in budget shares does not appear to be due to higher cost
 of living (non-durable consumption) alone.

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), the access to private education is limited to the wealthier households
 in both the economies.
 Given the insignificant private-education indicator vari1able 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the education expenditure as dependent variable for Nigeria (see Tables

 education appear far less than one would expect for the county (even though
 the privately-educated households in Nigeria do have higher budget shares
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for education).
 As private education only accounts for a minority of the population in
 both the economies (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"

 i.e.
 the variable

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we see that the effect of access to secondary-schools on education
 budget shares

\family default
 is stronger for Nigeria when taking wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
logA 
\family default
into account.
 The wealth effect is thus stronger than access in both the economies but
 is weaker for Nigeria where more household members enroll into secondary
 and tertiary education - regardless of the differences in long-term intergenera
tional wealth (measured with logarithm of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
logA
\family default
).
 The decomposed view of expense on education in terms of secondary and primary
 education level is important for this observation and reflects the far
 lower attendance of secondary education in Tanzania.
 The role of the number of children 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter

\family default
) seems stronger in Tanzania than in Nigeria - but that effect also seems
 likely due the education expenses driven by primary education in Tanzania.
\end_layout

We also see that the agrarian households spend higher on education (compare

) - after considering the wealth-concentration among households with the
 same educational-status (
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 having higher than primary education or not).
 In other words, the education expenditure can be considered higher for
 agrarian households in Tanzania after taking into account their poor educationa

\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (see coefficients of

 Again, this in part due to a significant portion of education expenses
 being spent on primary education in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without using the wealth-concentration, the role of rural and urban areas
 is less straightforward in the two economies.
 The coefficents of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 While the urban-rural indicators seem to indicate higher expenditure on
 education by the rural residents in Nigeria (see significance of

\begin_inset ERT

 This is indicated by the weaker role of wealth

 The wealth-concentration measure relies on a more clear-cut notion of urbanisat

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the wealth effects in Tanzania are stronger, they must be considered
 in light of the observation that the country has far lower levels of enrollment
 in secondary (and higher) education and has higher disparity in asset-ownership
 (even after taking into account the lower urbanisation levels).

) does indicate a general trend where those with higher inter-generational
 wealth and in urban areas are far more likely to avail the education facilities
, but a higher dependence on industrial output in Nigeria also seems to
 have contributed to a higher demand for secondary and tertiary education
 in the economy.
 The stronger role of father's education level in Tanzania is also related
 to these conditions.
 As such, the two countries do appear at different stages of urbanisation
 and economic development.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the role of social environment is significantly strong in both
 the economies.
 The role of English language seems significant in Tanzania - where the
 English-speakers spend significantly higher on education.
 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the educational expenses are higher among
 households identifying as Christian.
 In both cases, the role of social characteristics seems rather inseparable
 from the institutional differences towards education.
 In case of Tanzania, the ability to speak English is aligned with attending
 educational institutions while in Nigeria, the role played by Christian
 missionaries in establishment of educational may be reflected in the disparity
 of access to educational facilities.

 thus use three types of vicinities.
 The first interpretation is one where a simple average of the total assets
 owned by the households in the consumer's district.
 Both education rank and a factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the household head's occupation is agrarian or not are
 used as controls in this interpretation .
 The second interpretation is based on a factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the education level of the household-head is higher
 than primary school or not.
 More specifically, the second interpretation uses the prosperity within
 the educational levels implied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is also used as the additional control in this second interpretation.
 Finally, the third interpretation is based on the average prosperity in
 the agrarian vs non-agrarian occupations (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

) and uses educational rank as the additional control variable.
 The three interpretations are described in the Table

 Here too, we see that the wealth concentration corresponds to a rise in

 Further, since the coefficients for secondary-age indicator

 seem higher for the occupation cluster (i.e.
 the coefficient

) than for the education-cluster (

We had set ourselves to test if wealth effects are stronger than urbanisation
 levels towards education expenses in two economies of the SSA where the
 dependence of one on its industrial output is higher than that of the other.
 While there are idiosyncratic differences between the two countries we've
 used for our comparison, there are some implications on the challenges
 that higher development in the region brings to policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the agrarian consumers maintain a higher budget share on education expenses
 in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and higher education ranks consistently
 correspond to higher education expenses in the more developed economy (Nigeria)
, the educational expenses are likely to remain higher after attainment
 of education by the consumers and increase in regional prosperity.
 This seems aligned with the cohort-study from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who suggest that the labour with skills added through education is less
 - willing to stay in agricultural activities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of urbanisation levels - interpreted as wealth concentration
 - are significant on education expenses in both the economies.
 The rises in education expenses as the employment opportunities increase
 are inevitable - but so may be the extent to which lower wealth prevents
 access to education and mobility.
 The education levels of the population are clearly higher in Nigeria, but
 the wealth effects being significant in Nigeria and being extreme in Tanzania
 underscore the need for policy to improve access to education for the lower
 and middle-income populations regardless of the state which returns-to-educatio
n may be in.
 This seems relevant also because the private educational institutions -
 which are more common in Nigeria - do not yet play a major role in the
 provision of education in the region while a more significant role is played
 by the state-institutions in both the economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The improvement of access may also be directly relevant due to the issues
 of social exclusion that are indicated by the relevance of social characteristi
cs in education expenses for both the economies.
 The results pointing to the significance of language and religion share
 some of the observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - who have also highlighted the role of religious and colonial institutions
 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.

In summary, the development of the education seem to be at different stages
 in the two economies.
 The privatisation of education in Nigeria seems to have coincided with
 higher attendance of universities in a way that is yet to be seen for Tanzania
 - where education has not been as widespread just yet and the role of father's
 education rank on one's education is much higher.
 The wealth effects seem strong in both the economies, but the relevance
 of wealth-concentration in the population having higher education levels
 point to a promising direction where i) wealth becomes less important in
 access to education and ii) despite being limited to urban areas, the economic
 development does improve the access to education and employment opportunities
 for a larger cross-section of society.
