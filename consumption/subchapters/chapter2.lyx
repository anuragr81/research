\begin_layout Abstract
Many have argued that the severe high unemployment and a limited access
 to higher education have allowed higher education to act as a status commodity
 in sub-Saharan African economies.
 The current chapter explores the differential access to education in two
 representative countries in sub-Saharan Africa by comparing the education
 expenses from the consumption surveys against the regional long-term assets
 inequalities, income differences, household characteristics and access
 to private education.

\begin_layout Standard
The participation rates for secondary and higher education in many sub-Saharan
 African economies are one of the lowest.
 The tertiary education - in particular - remains inaccessible to a large
 population in the region and fails to provide adequate employment to those
 who do acquire it (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001,oketchAfricaHE2016,NdyaliHE_Unemployment_TNZ2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 On one hand, the years of underinvestment in education contribute to low
 productivity measures (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) while on the other, education also seems to have become a status commodity
 for the urban-rich in sub-Saharan Africa (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006,oketchAfricaHE2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Thus while the participation rates in higher education remain suppressed
 in the region, the escape of higher educated labour away from agriculture
 also directly contributes to a decline in agricultural labor supply (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The policy interest in addressing the inequalities in education in these
 circumstances - at both lower and higher levels - motivates our investigation
 of the effects of income and regional inequalities on access to education
 in two representative sub-Saharan African economies in the current chapter.

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long-term effects of education on economic growth and the limitations
 that income inequalities pose to the access to education have been of immense
 interest to policy initiatives at least since the mid-last century (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,TilakEducationPoverty2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The interest has also led to some heated debates in the literature - one
 such point of contention being that of the relative importance of private
 wealth against that of innate ability on educational performance in schools.
 Empirical studies often report the socio-economic status (SES) to be of
 less importance for educational performance in the poorer economies than
 in richer countries (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heynemanloxleyeffect1983"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Another point of contention has been the suggested diversion of public
 funds to basic education in preference over higher education.
 The current chapter attempts to shed some light on these issues by exploring
 how disparities on education expenses (obtained from consumption diaries
 in the Living Standard Measurement Study) may relate with the geographical
 disparities caused by uneven urbanisation and the prevailing local income
 inequalities in the region.
 Choosing Tanzania and Nigeria as the representative economies in sub-Saharan
 Africa, we also explore the extent to which education may be supported
 by private or religious institutions in the two economies.

The notion of prosperity in the consumer's immediate surroundings thus serves
 as an important control in the comparison of educational expenses in the
 two economies.
 The local prosperity - observed in a geographical reference area - is measured
 as the average of long-term assets in the consumer's vicinity and proxies
 the variation in urbanisation levels across the wider geographic areas.
 The other important control is that for the household's higher permanent
 income and is measured using the total household expenditure (based on
 the standard consumption theory - see

Our conclusions on future mobility and the treatment of educational expenses
 as means for the educational mobility relies on the

 The core of this argument is that a consumer who is better equipped with
 educational status is better prepared for higher prosperity
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
More particularly, there are two main reasons why the education-based human
 capital suffices for mobility studies in sub-Saharan Africa.
 First, the industrial development and universal education have been relatively
 recent phenomena in sub-Saharan Africa.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note for example, that less than 40% children of parents who haven't completed
 primary education actually end up completing primary education in the sub-Sahar
an Africa (with an extreme variation across the continent - 2% for S Sudan
 and 80% for S Africa).
 Second, the income-based measures of intergenerational mobility (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fieldsmcgillivrayinequality2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) are often ruled out because the earnings or income-based recalls - as
 pointed out by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "IversenKrishnaSenPovertyEscapes2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - are not meaningful in the surveys from developing economies (also see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TorcheLatinAmericaMobility2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This view also justifies the use of household head's education and the
 agrarian/non-agrarian primary household occupation as the controls for
 our comparison of educational expenses.
 We use the empirical results to explain how the different contexts of income
 level and consumption in the two economies could result in disparate education
 expenditures and in turn the future educational mobility of the consumers.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that such a comparison of education expenses against prosperity
 and household characteristics could be of interest for two specific areas
 of policy research.
 First, the disparities in richness and income have implications for migration
 pressures in the economy.
 More particularly, if the costs of living and amenities are less varied
 across reference areas in the economy, then a consumer may be indifferent
 between staying in a poorer reference and moving to a higher reference
 with higher relative poverty.
 This indifference changes when the reference areas are extremely dissimilar
 in terms of opportunities - resulting in asymmetrical human capital investments
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corakintergenerationalmobility2004"

\end_inset

) and higher residential segregation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Second, as education also seems to act as a status item in the region (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006,oketchAfricaHE2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the acquisitions through education may directly increase the inertia
 against moving to a poorer reference level (see

).

While education may not be counted among the basic necessities of an individual
 in all poverty-measurement surveys, it is seldom disputed that the lack
 of education contributes to the individual's poverty.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 summarises the importance of education by pointing out that - there is
 ‘‘no well educated literate population that is poor, [and] there is no
 illiterate population that is other than poor’’.
 Thus even the poorest individuals have a strong demand for education.
 The literature for the developing economies suggests no lack of willingness
 to pay for education among the poor either.
 If anything, there seems to be a compulsion to pay for education among
 the poor when education is not state-funded (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002"

\end_inset

).
 It is not surprising that despite the fierce debates on public expenditure
 for education, both the human capital perspective (

The policy discussions for choosing between the provision of free basic
 education to all (at the point of use) and the investments in higher education
 have seen some of the most heated debates related to education in the developin
g economies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanLDCOECDSchoolAchievements1980"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Those proposing the prioritisation of basic education point out that the
 role of primary and secondary education has been more important for growth
 in LDC nations than in OECD economies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "petrakisgrowtheduc2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and that the contribution of higher educational levels should increase
 gradually as the level of development increases (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "petrakisgrowtheduc2002,PsacharopoulosFinancingEducLDC1986"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 It has also been recommended (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsacharopoulosFinancingEducLDC1986"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) that public finance be diverted from higher education to primary education
 while letting higher education be privately funded.
 Some of the criticism (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) for this recommendation has been due the returns-to-education approach
 used by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 argues that the positive externalities from education are not factored
 into the productivity measures often used to argue against investments
 in higher education.
 That the individuals benefit culturally and physically from education -
 while reducing the costs of imparting social changes is ignored when using
 a returns-of-education approach.
 Not only does formal education may help workers pick up more skills on
 their own (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FullerVocationalTraining1976"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the secondary or higher education often provide the skills that are necessary
 in the labour market (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakPostelemEducIndia2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While the returns-to-education approach is often used to explain the impact
 of education (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "soderbomReturnstoEducationTNZKYA2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for example), it is generally agreed that the relationships between education
 and labour markets are more complex than a simple function of the increased
 productivity of educated workers (see

 In contrast with the view that overeducation is merely an issue of a longer
 search time in developing economies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heynemanInvestmentIndianEducUneconomic1980"
literal "false"

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oketchAfricaHE2016,MinnisNonformalEducation2006,dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001"

\end_inset

).
 The literature seems to offer two differing views on failures in education
 policy in sub-Saharan Africa that could have contributed to a high unemployment
 among graduates and a relatively low participation of higher education.
 On one hand, the literature suggests institutional problems and mismanagement
 in public education (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) that may have led to insufficient gains in economic growth from education
 in sub-Saharan African economies.
 On the other hand, it is also suggested that a policy focus away from skills
 needed in an informal economy have resulted in poor agricultural productivity
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

 in the late last century, it has had limited success in improving access

It would be an understatement to say that the structural problems that the

 The presence of a large informal sector severely constrains the funding

 Since many economies in the region have increasingly relied on commodity

 economy (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 the immense competition with China's producers has also meant that an underdeve

For the particular contexts of Nigeria and Tanzania, we note that Nigeria
 has had more investment in commodities sector (oil and petroleum) than
 Tanzania - which remains a relatively agrarian economy.
 The policy of education has also been different in the two economies -
 with Tanzania having a history of restrictions of secondary education at
 a time when other countries in the region were expanding their education
 sector (see

 The effect of regional prosperity and the permanent income differences
 on education at different stages in the two economies are thus of interest
 in the current chapter.
 We also explore how the access to education may be associated with the
 household characteristics such as religious identity, language spoken or
 education-level of the family in the two economies.

As mentioned earlier, the disparity in prosperity across regions is tracked
 with the average cost of assets owned within a normative geographical reference
 group surrounding the consumer.
 The effect of the local environment or reference group on consumption decisions
 has been marked significant in much of the recent empirical literature
 on consumption (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BeardenEtzelBrandRefGroup1982,ChildersRaoConsumptionRefGroup1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The first uses of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reference group
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 trace their roots in the discussions on notions of economic status of the
 early last century (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LewinPsychSoc1935"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The term itself was coined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 to explain the inadequacies of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

objective status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (obtained by measuring absolute income).
 A subjective notion of status - which reference groups could help track
 - was elaborated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "HymanStatuPsych1942"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who also enumerated three types of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 to measure objective, the subjective and the accorded notions of status.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 later describes three types of reference groups - the comparative group
 (one the consumer compares herself to), the membership group (which the
 consumer thinks she belongs to) and the normative group (where the consumer
 gets her standards from).
 The sense of a reference group and the methods for measurement used vary
 significantly in empirical studies.
 For example, the classic approach on relative income (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Duesenberry1949"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) uses the consumer's past income or consumption as the reference-level
 income.
 Studies on subjective welfare - on the other hand - use a wealth-based
 reference group (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GrahamFeltonInequalityHappinessLatAm2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The literature on subjective welfare in sub-Saharan Africa has preferred
 using the geographical areas surrounding the consumer residence as the
 normative reference group (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This is the sense of reference group followed in the current chapter for
 the comparison of educational expenses across differences in prosperity,
 urbanisation and household characteristics.

The interpretation of prosperity in consumer's normative reference group

In an environment of severe income inequalities of a typical developing
 economy, one observes both that certain geographical areas are much poorer
 (richer) compared to others and that there are extreme income differences
 within the geographical area of reference (on average).
 In the current chapter, we set ourselves to measure how disparities in
 prosperity both across geographical areas and within a locality may affect
 intergenerational-educational levels and the educational expenses that
 influence future mobility.
 Here, a normative reference group defined over the consumer's vicinity
 is used to measure the levels of prosperity - which is interpreted as the
 average long-term assets within the normative group.
 The measurement of the prosperity thus relies on the market-value of assets
 (including land, housing) observed directly in the data (see Section

In its essence, the representative consumer in this simple model balances
 i) increasing her consumption relative to the prosperity of her normative
 reference group with ii) preparing to be in an area of higher prosperity.
 More specifically, the consumer of a certain age selects a particular area
 of prosperity as well as a certain level of consumption relative to the
 reference level implied by the prosperity of the reference area while simultane
ously improving her chances of being an area of higher prosperity (with
 expenses that also depends on the reference area).
 The normative choice between educational expenses and other consumption
 is key to the survey of the two economies.

More specifically, the consumer's educational expenses encompass a notion
 of her preparedness to be in a reference area of higher prosperity - a
 notion that also allows a consumer inertia from moving away to a poorer
 reference for a gain in relative positional advantage.
 After having a certain educational level, assets acquisition or having
 a specialised in a particular occupation, a consumer may thus not move
 back (due to lower utility implied) to the reference poorer in absolute
 terms (measured by average long-term assets in the reference) and choose
 to spend on her readiness to move to a higher reference (that higher education
 contributes towards).
 The measures of local prosperity and the current education level associated
 with the family are thus important controls for our comparison of educational
 expenses.

If one can assume that all the consumers are on a deterministic path of
 needs, then it is possible to understand the life-cycle effects in the
 framework as well.
 More particularly, the consumers with lower working age may have less accumulat
ions as well as needs while the households with older working ages may have
 higher needs and the imminent dissolution of assets to the progeny (with
 no bequest assumed).
 The costs of being in a certain area of reference with a given prosperity
 are akin to younger consumers investing in the prosperity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 as older consumers shed the accumulated assets to the successive generations
 - maintaining the mobility and growth in the economy.

The arguments for treating educational expenses towards mobility different
 from consumption rely on the observation that the choice a certain area
 of prosperity is never simultaneous with that of consumption.
 Simply put, the fruits of selecting a better area of prosperity must arrive
 later than the consumption in one's reference.
 The selection of the prosperity - denoted as

 - is thus similar in some ways to how a consumer may postpone fulfillment
 through asset accumulations in an intertemporal setting - but unlike with

 The parametric analyses for non-durable consumption use a seemingly unrelated

\end_inset

) for the educational expenses.
 We also provide results of a logistic regression to explain the educational
 mobility over a generation with the effects of local prosperity and the
 education rank of the father of the household head on the educational rank
 of the household.

The educational rank of the household is set to the educational rank of

 Other than as a control variable in the sureg for educational expenses,
 the educational rank is also used in the dependent variable for the logistic
 regression - as an indicator variable which is set to true when the education
 rank of the household head is higher than that of the father (of the household
 head).

Given the recent industrialisation in the sub-Saharan Africa, the dichotomy

 our analyses and is explored in the framework in two different ways.
 First, the effects of being in an agrarian occupation on educational expense
 and mobility are compared against those of local prosperity.
 Second, role of the prosperity is considered separately for among the agrarian
 and non-agrarian populations in the consumer's normative reference (immediate

 The second interpretation is based on a factor variable

 More specifically, the second interpretation uses the prosperity within
 the educational levels implied by

 (i.e.
 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 is also used as the additional control in this second interpretation.
 Finally, the third interpretation is based on the average prosperity in
 the agrarian vs non-agrarian occupations (i.e.

The age

 of the consumer household and demographic characteristics such as religion
 are also important controls for an understanding of educational mobility
 and expenses.
 The role of age allows us to discuss the life-cycle effects in our analysis
 - as a consumer household having acquired more assets over her lifetime
 is less likely to aspire to improve her reference area by spending more
 on education.
 A similar inertia applies to having acquired more education itself - as
 a consumer household after having acquired a higher educational level or
 a certain occupation tied to a reference, may not consider a higher relative
 richness in a reference area of less prosperity despite the promise of
 higher relative prosperity in a poorer reference (due to liquid assets
 of the household).
 The consumer household's age, household-size and the social identity are
 thus important controls for the empirical analysis presented in Section

 educational expenses and distribution of assets.
 In the first set of regressions for educational expenses, we use the following
 equations with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$

 as the prices associated with non-durable expenditure in the region (calculated
 as unit-value i.e.
 the average expenditure in the district), prosperity level 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in the consumer's reference area, the demographic variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{i}$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 age of the household-head, the family size etc.) and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 as the total worth of the consumer household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in a given year (including the assets owned and the total annual expenditure)

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For convenience the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 has been dropped in the further use of the control variables and the dependent

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\Omega}$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 (respectively).
 The second set of regressions for the educational expenses uses the logarithm
 of educational expenses 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{ne})$
\end_inset

 as the dependent variable against the same set of control variables.
 While the appearance of educational expenses both in the dependent variable
 and in the logarithm of the total expenditure

\end_inset

 (used as the control variable) may cause some endogeneity, it does not
 interfere with our comparison of the relative of effects of

\begin_layout Standard
A concern with the above use of a nominative reference group may be that
 certain prevalent social groups in an economy could be the cause of a disparity
 within or across geographical areas - thus resulting in an omitted variable
 bias when ignored.
 While we do pay attention to social identities in the current study, we
 also note that such a social identity (race, religion or other) must both
 be observed at a wider level across all the geographical areas of reference
 and have a direct influence on the consumer's prosperity for there to be
 a significant bias.
 Since we don't find any evidence for a significant political disadvantage
 to a specific social identity in either Nigeria and Tanzania, the role
 of social identities across all the geographic areas are unlikely to be
 separate from the controls of prosperity (even if social identities may
 have a role to play at the finer levels within the geographical area of
 reference).
 This is not to suggest that the consumer societies in sub-Saharan Africa
 - much like elsewhere - are not organised around clans or social groups,
 only that the effect of reference groups implied by such micro-identities
 aggregated over larger areas are unlikely to be significantly different
 from the effect implied by prosperity of assets - so long as the diverse
 identities are dispersed over the wider geographical extent and do not
 form a separate social group with a direct prosperity disadvantage.
 In particular, if the communities within a geographical area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 do not share a social disadvantage with the community members in another
 geographical area 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, then the effects of different geographical reference prosperity levels
 in the two areas would dominate the factors for consumption.
 The relevance of social identities thus does not interfere with our definition
 of a normative reference group based on geographical locations.

The educational expenses and the non-asset related expenditures are used
 from the Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) - conducted by the World
 Bank.
 We use the LSMS for the years 2012-2014 (Tanzania) and 2012-2015 (Nigeria).
 While the data for consumption diaries are available also for 2010 in both
 Nigeria and Tanzania survey, we ignore the year 2010 due the value of assets
 being unavailable for Tanzania in the year 2010.

As described earlier, the prosperity levels are interpreted as the logarithm
 of the averages of asset-values and are calculated as per the specifications
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The asset-values rely on the stock of durable goods owned by every consumer
 available in the surveys - where the items range from the short-term durable
 goods such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such
 as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the the long-term assets that can be transferred
 over a generation - we focus only on the items that are costlier than the
 median furniture value in both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data for Tanzania.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts for the
 wider level consumer vicinity based on Euclidean distance.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards
 in the 6 
\begin_inset Formula $km$

To provide a uniform treatment to educational level across both Tanzania

 to rank 2 for until the completion of primary education, to rank 3 for
 up to the secondary education level and to 4 for all higher education levels
 (higher-secondary, university etc.).

 and corresponds to the education rank 2 ; all standards above D7 correspond
 to the education rank 3 (

 Similar, P6 is the highest primary education level in Nigeria and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma=1$

Urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents in Nigeria whereas
 they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears get much costlier in Tanzania since the

 the expenditure on education rank 2 in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these costs rise by about 54%.

While the overall poverty levels appear similar in Nigeria and Tanzania
 , the disparity in owned assets is observed to be more extreme in Tanzania
 (particularly between the south of the country and the east - see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"

 The inequality in expenditure on non-durable consumption - on the other
 hand - is not as different for the two economies.

The range of occupations available to the consumer populations in the surveys

 To compare the role of occupations in the two economies, we standardise
 all the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria into
 occupation ranks ranging from 0 to 3.
 These occupation ranks are based on sorting the varied occupations in the
 two economies by the income of consumers in the respective countries.

 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem

We also note that the average consumer in the urban areas for both the economies
 - despite better options for lifestyle and consumption - seems to struggle
 with basic needs.
 To compare the fulfillment of basic needs in urban vs rural areas, we look
 at the fraction of consumers that have run out of food in the last 12 months
 in every district across both economies (either due to lack of agricultural
 inputs or high prices) in Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 These indicate a significant number of households running out of food in
 urban areas (due to high costs) - even though the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons).
 It only suggests that the expenditure on education may very much a luxury
 for a significant part of the population.

While we undertake a more detailed view on consumption in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Parametric-Analysis"

\end_inset

, the key observation from the non-parametric view of the data is that the
 disparities in income and assets are more localised in Nigeria while they
 are more extreme across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The two dependent variables - budget shares for educational expenses (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

) and total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 are used in the estimation with price of non-durable expenditure in the
 consumer's vicinity as a control (see Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:main_estimation"

).
 As described in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Econometric-Method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

 in the reference area - interpreted as the cost of living in the reference
 - are measured as the the average consumption excluding the asset costs
 in the consumer's vicinity.
 Based on the standard consumption theory (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the total household expenditures are meant to be related with the household’s
 permanent income - thus permitting the use of the logarithm of total expenditur
e 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 as the control for permanent income in the estimation.
 The results from the OLS estimation for 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$

 are listed in the Table

\end_inset

.
 Of these control variables, some are specific to the individual household.
 More specifically, the age of the household age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (

age

), the factor variable

 occupation or not), the size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$

 of the household (

\family default
), the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{t})$
\end_inset

 (

\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{*}$
\end_inset

 of the head of the household (

 The variables observed at the level of the reference area - are the number
 of rural wards 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 ( 
\family typewriter

- divisions within a district marked as rural in the survey), the logarithm
 of the per-head cost of non-durable consumption excluding assets costs
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$

 (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma,\tau,\Omega,r,\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

, the logit formulation also uses the education rank of the household head's
 father 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

(
\family typewriter
\size small
father_educ_rank
\family default
\size default
) as one of the control variables.
 Further, in an alternate formulation for educational expenses, we regress
 the logarithm of total expenditure on education against the same control
 variables as for 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ne},w_{educ}$
\end_inset

.
 The educational expense used both as the dependent variable and in the
 logarithm of the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 as the control variable causes a well-known endogeneity problem (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace,ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) that is resolved by instrumenting the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 with the occupation data in the survey.
 Accepting at most a rejection rate of 10% of a nominal 5% Wald test, the
 eigenvalue test statistic are higher than 20 (with the critical value of
 16.38) for all the regressions - and allow us to reject the null hypothesis
 that the instrument is a weak one.

 is uncorrelated with any of the control variables x_{t} - and allows us
 to see the effect of r_{t} and other fixed characteristics) is more useful
 to understand the effect of prices rather than the fixed effects that don't
 change.
 For this reasons, we have focused on the cross-sectional approach.

The key goal of empirical analysis is to find out if the educational expenses
 in the two economies rise more sharply as a result higher prosperity in
 the local cross-section of incomes or due to disparities in prosperity
 across wider geographical areas.
 As education is a clear means for mobility, the disparity in education
 would imply a limited mobility in the economy.
 As described earlier, the levels of urbanisation are proxied using the
 the asset-prosperity of the consumer's vicinity while the local income
 differences are accounted for using the control for permanent income.
 The analysis contrasts educational expenses and mobility in the two economies
 by looking at the relative effects of wider and local income differences.

 rise for families in the two economies.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
We had set ourselves to understand how wider disparities in urbanisation
 and improvements of income at local levels may affect the differences in
 educational expenses and mobility in the context of sub-Saharan Africa.
 Treating the educational expenses as investments in mobility, we find significa
nt effects of regional prosperity and institutional differences on both
 education expenses and mobility.
 Our results share many of the wider observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - who also highlight the role of religious and colonial institutions in
 the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.
 Since the agrarian consumers maintain a higher budget share on education
 expenses in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and higher education ranks correspond
 to higher education expenses in the developed economy (Nigeria), it would
 appear that the educational expenses remain higher after attainment of
 education by the consumers and increase in regional prosperity.
 This latter observation is aligned with the cohort-study from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who suggest that the labour with skills added through education is less
 willing to stay in agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the special cases for the two economies, we see that the separation
 of opportunities for education and mobility is stronger in Tanzania where
 agrarian occupations seem to lag far behind in basic education relative
 to the urban areas.
 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the level of urbanisation and access to
 education are generally higher but the differences brought about prosperity
 differences and religious institutions are significant.
 Thus while overall educational levels and expenses do rise with prosperity
 (as in Nigeria), the access to education as a means for mobility remains
 extremely segmented due to social factors and assets-prosperity in both
 the economies.
