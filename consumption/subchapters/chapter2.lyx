\begin_layout Abstract
The economies in sub-Saharan Africa witness high unemployment and significant
 wealth effects that limit access to higher education.
 The current study compares the importance of wealth effects in Tanzania
 and Nigeria for education expenses across varied levels of urbanisation,
 access to secondary education and household permanent income in the two
 countries.
 Despite the effects of social and institutional structures on access to
 education, the extremity of wealth effects in the poorer and less-urban
 economy suggests that a rise in urbanisation may act to reduce the relevance
 of wealth for educational attainment in the region.

 They point out that education is available more widely in the urban than
 in the rural areas of many developing countries.
 When education is publicly funded and funding is regionally decentralized,
 we would expect the extent of educational provi- sion in a region to depend
 on its income.
 A prosperous region can afford to devote more resources to education; unless
 it is cross-subsidized, a poor region can afford less.
 Given a high urbanrural income disparity, the more rural regions are at
 an educational disadvantage.

% (DONE) 24.1.2.1.
 In market economies, households with more income demand more education
 as a consumption good.
 Second, given capital market imperfections richer households can better
 afford to invest in education.
 For instance, the foregone earnings cost may bear more heavily on poor
 households.
 Third, richer households may have the knowledge, the contacts or the complement
ary resources which raise the rate of return to education for them.
 For these reasons we expect household income and the educational attainment
 of children to be positively related in countries with predominantly private
 educational systems.
 Thus, rural-urban income disparities can also generate educational disparities.

% (DONE) 24.1.2.2.
 In state education economies, the children of educated parents may be at
 a competitive advantage not only because they tend to inherit greater natural
 ability but also because they have better opportunities to acquire out-of-schoo
l human capital.
 For instance, they may receive more stimulus from the household environment,
 absorb more favourable attitudes and have better access to books or to
 electric light for evening study.
 In this way educational inequalities can be transmitted from one generation
 to another.

 TilakDeterminantsHouseholdexpenditureinRuralIndia2002 - also finds that
 poor spend proportionately higher in India.
 They argue that one cannot assume the education is free - because the poor
 do spend high amounts on education (if not on fees then a lot of other
 related expenses).
 This is a social cost therefore.
 Tilak goes on to discuss -  why households invest in education.
 First, education is not sufficiently free from the govt.
 Second, they believe that high fees means high efficiency.
 They're also interested in whether education is  a superior good or not.
 They find that at an all India level, household expenditures on education
 are less elastic to changes in household income.
 They find that Muslims do not spend as much on education.
 They find that differences by occupational groups in household expenditures
 on education in government and government-aided private schools are not
 high; but they are high in private schools.
 The parental education level does matter significantly in the rural areas.
 They also use a village-development-index (which is meant to correspond
 to higher educexp).

%[DEMAND Question] - Wealth effects are like gravity for education attainment
 - but leaving pointing to a general relevance of social factors is not
 an option.
 Given that we consider both Nigeria and Tanzania (focusing on NGR alone
 is an option), the urbanisation - which is a major supply side issue -
 should be seen highlighted as a measure that compares with the direct measure
 of educational institutitions are spread in the country.
 Only thing that is important is the wealth effect - which has two effects
 - quality of education and social exclusion.
 We don't have a measure for quality - so we focus only on higher expenditure
  on education after controlling for non-durable consumption prices in the
 region (i.e.
 if consumer spend more on education with respect to other non-durable expenditu
re relative to non-durable expenditure).
 The second issue is to understand if wealth may be limited access to higher
 levels of education.
 The lower demand for education could either be due to low returns to education
 or due to wealth limiting access.
 As returns to education is not availalbe to us, we are interested only
 if wealth is preventing access and therefore causes some degree of social
 exclusion both through wealth (price of education and wealth) and social
 factors relevant to wealth.

The participation rates for secondary and higher education remain one of
 the lowest for the economies of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
 Education remains inaccessible to the vast majority and also inadequate
 in providing mobility to those with low-income who do acquire it (

key "dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001,oketchAfricaHE2016,NdyaliHE_Unemployment_TNZ2016,MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

).
 This low participation in education has been attributed both to an insufficient
 focus on non-formal education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 ) and the barriers imposed by inadequate wealth (

\end_inset

).
 In the presented chapter, we focus on the changes brought about by urbanisation
 in SSA that may act to reduce or worsen the effect of long-term wealth
 (i.e.
 wealth effects) on education expenditures.
 The role of urbanisation is compared across two countries - Tanzania and
 Nigeria - which are selected due to significant differences in levels of
 urbanisation and the degree of dependence on agrarian production.

There are two key factors that we consider for the examining role of urbanisatio
n in the comparison of educational expenditure in the two economies are
 the physical access to education facilities and the wealth effects.
 Given the importance of secondary education that is argued in much of the
 literature on education in the developing economies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FullerVocationalTraining1976,TilakEducationPoverty2002,TilakPostelemEducIndia2007,HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanInvestmentIndianEducUneconomic1980"

\end_inset

), we focus on the accessibility of secondary education in the two economies.
 For wealth effects, we use both the total expenditure and asset possessions
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

assets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signifies the goods that are owned by the household.
 These constitute items that are more often referred to as durable goods
 in the consumption literature from the developed economies.
 There seem at least two reasons why the developing economics literature
 more often refers to the durable household possessions as assets.
 First, the financial assets are far less relevant in the developing economies.
 Second, the durable goods such as bicycles or stoves - however insignificant
 - are far more important for consumption behaviour in the developing world.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to explore the role of urban-rural differences in more detail.
 After accounting for urbanisation levels - measured using a spatial distributio
n of wealth in the survey data from the respective economies- we find that
 the wealth effects for education are more severe in less urbanised areas.

The notion of urbanisation in the study takes into the consideration the
 concentration of wealth in the two economies.
 While several empirical studies use urban-rural effects to explain disparities
 in education expenditures in SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "EbaidallaSudanHHeducExpenditure2018,DonkohDeterminantsHHEducExpenditure2011"

\end_inset

) as well as in other developing economies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BayarDeterminantsEducTurkey2016,KnightEducationalattainmentRuralUrbanChina1996,AcarHHEducTurkey2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), recent studies have highlighted the need to consider spatial distribution
 of resources and employment opportunities in the SSA - instead of the broad
 or implicit urban-rural classifications that are often used in surveys
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AbayYoungRuralEconomy2021,WigginsProctorRuralUrban2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As such, the urban-rural disparities influence participation in education
 through various mechanisms.
 The physical access to education itself is one such mechanism.
 As education is more widely available in urban areas of the developing
 economies than the rural parts, the availability of education facilities
 is a mechanism correlated with urban-rural disparities (which are often
 made worse if funding for education is decentralised 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KnightEducationalattainmentRuralUrbanChina1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Another mechanism is the relative abundance of opportunities for higher
 income employment in urban areas that make education more affordable -
 so that the rural households invariably earning lower incomes end up underinves
ting in education.
 Finally, the social environment of the urban areas - including the local
 returns of education - may also differ from that of the rural areas - an
 effect that may overweigh other factors in the case of a significant social
 segregation in the economy.

\begin_layout Standard
A well-defined measure for urbanisation is key to our study as it allows
 us distinguish between the effects of urbanisation from wealth effects.
 The primary interpretation of urbanisation that we rely in the current
 study is that of concentration of wealth in a 6-km
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

region
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 scale in the district where the household residence is located - is based
 on the geographical distances between districts and the average distance
 to the education facility recorded in the consumption survey.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This spatial interpretation of urbanisation is based on the average local
 wealth possession in the area where the household resides.
 Referred to as wealth-concentration in the rest of the chapter, the measure
 proxies the concentration of asset-ownership across an economy and provides
 a continuous - rather than categorical - variable for urbanisation levels.
 On the other hand, the wealth effects - measured as effects of household
 wealth on its education expenditures (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - are contrasted against the urbanisation effects which encompass the
 positive externality from being in a rich (wealthy) area.
 An important control in the comparison of urbanisation effects and wealth
 effects is the physical access to education which directly influences education
 expenditure.
 The wealth effects on education can follow due to various mechanisms.
  Other than through costs (such as transportation) imposed on households
 when education access is poorer, household wealth influences access to
 education can could also be due to - information symmetries that help in
 future job-searches, a better representation in nascent political institutions
 of a developing economy and social characteristics that may align with
 higher local (relative) wealth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 As higher intergenerational wealth may help fund higher levels of education,
 the wealth inequalities within a particular locality can easily turn into
 educational inequalities by creating a poverty trap for the lower-income
 households (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This has been an important concern for policy in SSA due to the predominance
 of large informal sector in the region and the higher consequent income
 volatility that could deprioritise education expenditures for poorer households
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011,MinnisNonformalEducation2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The wealth effects evidently get worse at higher levels of education as
 the foregone labour income through time spent in education becomes costlier
 for households with low possessions or wealth.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is a necessary control for the comparison of wealth effects against urbanisatio
n effects.
 The control often plays a critical role in determining whether a given
 amount of funds is more appropriately used to build accessible schools
 or to support and economise education instead.
 More specifically, if physical access for education is what prevents the
 attainment of education, then building more schools becomes of higher priority.
 On the other hand, if wealth effects are stronger in the economy, then
 affordability of education becomes an important issue - even if returns
 to education were a cause of concern.
 In fact, whether returns to education are enough to increase education
 participation for lower-income households or not often hinges on there
 being less significant wealth effects and sufficient physical access to
 education in an economy (

As we have already stated, the social environment of a household may also
 favour its participation in education.
 While the effects of discernible factors such as segregation or exclusion
 base on social identities education have been often highlighted in SSA
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011"

), the specific role of social factors that may encourage or support education
 present a more challenging task to the empirical studies.
 Early attempts to explain the role of social factors have advanced the
 notion of social capital (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BourdieuCulturalRepr2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - which encompasses habits, preferences and behaviour cultivated in richer
 environments that affect future educational mobility.
 The empirical studies pertaining to social capital - however emphasise
 upon certain environmental factors - such as the feedback for improvement
 of students, the subjective evaluations of students or other measures of
 social interactions (

 The empirical measures for social capital are thus hardly equivalent to

In the current study, the relevant social factors encompass the acquisition
 of skills from parents or from the social environment (networks) that are
 valued in the employment markets and at higher levels of education.
 The parental educational levels - which are widely observed to have a significa
nt effect on education attainment in the developing economies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TanselParentEducEffects1997"

\end_inset

 One could argue - from a human capital perspective (

key "WuZhangUnequalEduc2008,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999,GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,SpaullPovertyEducSA2013"

 of wealth (which has a strong effect on educational expenditures) since
 both accumulations are transferred to further generations (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BeckerTomesEquilibMobility1979"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The other important factor considered in the current study that may favour
 participation in education is the main occupation in the household.
 More particularly, the agrarian or non-agrarian nature of the household
 occupation in a largely agrarian economy may indicate a non-transactional
 advantage for individuals through the social networks they acquire.
 The use of occupation as a control also allows us to test if it is more
 often that the non-agrarian workers treat education as a basic need for
 the occupations they aim for (all else being the same) or if it is the
 agrarian sections instead who spend more on education (when accessible)
 - viewing it as the only way out of poverty (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakDeterminantsHouseholdexpenditureinRuralIndia2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Other household characteristics of social significance that influence participa
tion in education vary across the economies.
 In Tanzania, for example, the speakers of English language seem to be generally
 more educated and have higher incomes.
 The ability to speak English could indicate an exposure to education in
 ways that the poorer or rural households may not be exposed.
 The religious identities also have some implications for participation
 in education in countries such as Nigeria (

An essential claim of the human capital theory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TilakEducationPoverty2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) - which the empirical literature on determinants of education expenditure
 often relies on - is that the educational investments must change over
 the life cycle of consumers.
 The current chapter takes advantage of the reporting of household expenditures
 on education at individual level in the surveys for both the countries
 and considers how the education expenditure may vary with the age of the
 children in the household.
 The variables for childrens' ages are important for our comparison also
 because the education expenditures for a population where the majority
 joins the workforce after attaining primary education would be very different
 from one where the employment opportunities are higher for educated individuals.
 Since large households have higher basic needs than smaller households,
 we also consider the number of children as another relevant control that
 is closely related with lifecycle concerns.
 It is worth highlighting that while one may expect the household expenses
 on education to decline with the rise in number children due to a higher
 cost pressures, studies often find that education enrollments to rise instead
 of decline with the number of children in some sub-Saharan African countries

It is also worth reiterating how a particular sense of urbanisation helps
 us separate the effects of wealth concentration from the social factors
 we have identified above as well.
 The measure of wealth-concentration as inter-generational long-term assets
 quantifies urban-rural disparities and allows us to assess the extent to
 which a higher wealth concentration may provide a more supportive environment
 for education participation after accounting for the effects of wealth,
 occupation in the household, the physical access in the region (the district
 boundary in the surrounding 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

distance) and other factors of social significance.
 The particular interpretation of urbanisation is based on suggestions to
 consider spatial distribution of assets in the recent literature - which
 has emphasised the network of occupations and contractual relationships
 surrounding the ownership of land or natural resources in SSA (

 based on categorical variables from community surveys that may not consider

As mentioned earlier, the two economies in SSA that we have selected for
 our comparison of education expenditure have different levels of economic
 development and a different degree of dependence on agrarian output.
 More particularly, Nigeria relies more heavily on energy exports while
 Tanzania's economy is more reliant on its agricultural output - a difference
 that is critical for the varied level of urbanisation in the two economies.
 While the educational attainments in the populations of the two countries
 are evidently shaped by the idiosyncrasies of the policy and distinct social
 factors, the varying levels of urbanisation in the two economies allow
 us to explore the challenges that improvement of employment opportunities
 and economic development may bring towards access to education in the region.
 More particularly, if wealth effects matter less in the urbanised areas
 i.e.
 if education is more egalitarian for residents in the urban areas (after
 controlling for physical access), then the policy may not need to focus
 on wealth effects and direct the attention to improving access elsewhere
 instead.
 On other hand, if wealth effects are significant despite higher economic
 development in urbanised regions, then more attention is needed for improvement
 of access to education for lower-income households.

 The

 the wealth

 (see Section

 The wealth-concentration measure is simply the average asset-ownership
 levels in the households' vicinity.
 Apart from taking spatial considerations across wider geographical scales
 into account - the wealth concentration used as as the explanatory variable
 in this formulation avoids the population density based approaches due
 to issues arising of densely populated rural areas in SSA economies (

 Of the several controls used in the study - including the demographic and
 household characteristics directly observed in the consumption surveys
 - the most important control is that of education's physical access - which
 we measure using the number of secondary schools in every district.
 More specifically, a higher score of

 demarcations, we use the total value of long-term assets owned by the household

 The use of wealth-indices based on the stock of durable goods (excluding
 short-term durable goods that are not transferred over a generation) is
 also common in the studies from health and household economics (

 However, as the study is concerned only with the relative importance of
 urbanisation and permanent income measures in the two countries - rather
 than the elasticities of expenditure, the endogeneity issues are less relevant
 to the comparison of household educational expenditure.
 Note also that the issues of intra-household allocation of educational
 expense among children are not relevant to our cross-section analysis.
 It is worth highlighting also that the disparity in education quality is
 out of scope of the current chapter - as we rely on the current levels
 of education for members in the family and the availability of secondary-educat

The main finding from the current study is that with the two economies taken
 together, a higher urbanisation is correlated with lower severity of wealth
 effects.
 While the higher urbanisation may itself depend on the country's governmental
 efficiency, natural resources or fiscal condition, it does seem to reduce
 the wealth effects on education.
 Despite the peculiarities of inequality in SSA such as high land-labour
 ratios and sparse distribution of economic resources (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersoninequalityandvariableSAA2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), therefore, the weakening of wealth effects with rising urbanisation points
 in a promising direction and marks past success in education improvements
 in the region.
 The study also finds that the segregation of education opportunities and
 the disparities in future employment opportunities across the country are
 more evident in Tanzania where the differences between urban and rural
 prosperity seem more extreme.
 The other side of the seemingly desirable effects of urbanisation, therefore,
 is that the need to improve to education participation in less urbanised
 areas remains a significant challenge for policy.
 The recommendations for addressing non-formal education and improving basic
 education for rural populations may therefore be an important concern for
 an education policy when urbanisation is not easy to achieve for the economy.

The current chapter contributes to the literature on determinants of education
 in two different ways.
 First, it demonstrates that despite the challenges of urban overpopulation,
 the effect of urbanisation may be a desirable one for the education levels
 of the population and the lifestyle improvements in urban areas.
 This may support the conventional view that despite the evident problems
 with rise in inequality, the urbanisation may play a key role in economic
 growth (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KuznetsEconomicGrowthIneq2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 More particularly, the weakening in severity of wealth effects with the
 rise in urbanisation could indicate the pathways to future improvements
 in income equality and reduction in education inequalities through developments
 of the industrial sector and rise in demand for education.
 The second contribution of the chapter is the delineation of links between
 levels of economic activity and education levels - which we perform considering
 the spatial concentration of wealth and education across the two economies.
 While most of the literature we have surveyed has focused on the urban-rural
 dichotomy from community, the current study relies on the spatial distribution
 of wealth to examine the specific link between wealth-concentration, occupation
al levels and education expenses in the region.

While education may not be considered a basic necessity in all poverty-measureme
nt surveys, it is seldom disputed that a lack of education contributes to
 poverty.
 Even in the developing economies, the poorest individuals might have a
 strong demand for education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The literature also suggests that when education is not state-funded in
 the developing economies, there might be a compulsion - rather than a mere
 willingness - to pay for education among the poor (

 With a high demand for educated workforce in an industrialising economy,
 there seems little disagreement in policy therefore - whether from a human

An important consideration for education attainment in the population is
 that while higher education does provide skills for higher incomes, the
 expenditure on education tends to be often limited by the wealth one possesses.
 The differences in education elasticities based on income have in fact
 been emphasised in the literature early on since mid-last century (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The empirical studies from the SSA have reported significant wealth effects
 on education as well (

While the wealth-effects remain significant in SSA, much of the discussion
 on the high graduate unemployment and low higher-education participation
 has focused on the poor returns to education in the region.
 On one hand, the literature attributes these problems to the prevalent
 mismanagement in public education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"

) and on the other it highlights a misplaced focus on formal education in
 the informal economy settings (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Instead of focusing on the returns-to-education, we argue in the current
 chapter that the poor returns might not offer a complete view of lower
 participation in education.
 There are two ways in which this may occur.
 First, the education needs or perceived value of education may not be adequatel
y captured when using a returns-to-education approach in developing economies.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 point out, the returns-to-education approaches tend to ignore the positive
 externalities from education

 and that such changes are ignored when using a returns-of-education approach.
 It would seem also that not only does formal education help workers pick
 up more skills on their own (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), the skills from secondary or higher education are often necessary in

\end_layout

 Second, the role of education facilities and the wealth effects may by
 more dominant than the issue of poor returns-to-education in an economy
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive externalities from education - which one may use to argue that
 the returns-to-education perspective is an incomplete one - are less of
 an issue in the context of SSA.
 Many empirical studies in fact report several instances of waste in rent-seekin
g activities after graduation in the SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oketchAfricaHE2016,MinnisNonformalEducation2006,dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The case for positive externalities from education is weakened further
 due to the low economic growth experienced by the countries in the last
 decades - a slide that may have suppressed the value of secondary or higher
 education in the region.
 While return-to-education remains an important concern in the region, we
 emphasise however that it needs to be viewed in the context of wealth effects
 and availability of education facilities.
 More particularly, it is possible that the demand for education is suppressed
 due to inadequate income (relatively high prices of education) in the economy
 or a sparse distribution of education opportunities rather than due to
 lower returns from post-education employment opportunities alone (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 If education expenditures are better explained with physical access, then
 the policy may need to focus on building more accessible schools whereas
 if wealth-effects are more significant, then there is a need to make education
 more affordable for the lower-income households.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of SSA, the empirical studies also find that the physical
 access is less significant than the wealth effects (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,KambonBusbyEducationPoverty2000,ObasuyiEducationInequality2019"

 There is some evidence that the effects of physical access do become stronger
 at higher (secondary and tertiary) levels of education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NgwareOnsomuKenyaSecEd2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 The effect of urban-rural differences - which may be correlated with difference
 in both physical access and wealth concentration - has also been widely
 reported to be significant in SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Both urbanisation-levels and wealth - controlled for with the physical
 access to education - have been important concerns in the current chapter.

Another way to interpret the effect of a standardised wealth-concentration
 measure of urban-rural differences is the contrasting of local vs wider
 wealth disparities which prevent access to education.
 The specific interpretation of urbanisation helps explore whether the effects
 of urban environment on education are related to costs of education - measured
 through income effects - or not.
 In other words, the specific interpretation provides us a clearer view
 of the role of social factors - since the urban-rural labels of the survey
 could enclose social division - such as ethnic or socio-economic distinctions-
 as well.
 As

 While this early research has viewed education as a certain high-culture

 refinements have focused on the specific role of social networks and parental
 acquisitions or skills (

 in Netherlands.
 More importantly, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DeGraafParentalCulturalCapital2000"

 In another study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GouldParentalQuality2020"

\end_inset

 point out that higher educated parents invariably spend more time with
 children - a social factor that contributes to how parental education levels
 influence the next generation.
 In fact, the high-culture participation does not always influence educational
 performance positively either.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ByunTheseisCulturalCapitalSouthKorea2007"

\end_inset

 in South Korea as it takes time off from study.

 economic factors that are relevant for participation in education.
 Recent literature is more often concerned with a

 The scope of social effects in the current study is thus limited to that

 or paternal characteristics (paternal education-level, occupation).

In summary, we note several factors - such as the pro-rich nature of education,
 an insufficient focus on informal economy, mismanagement in public expenditure
 on education and poor returns after graduation - that may simultaneously
 contribute to education expenses and the low education participation in
 SSA.
 The disparate local environments in the SSA imply that generic or partial
 solutions to improvements of education opportunities are unlikely to be
 successful if one ignores local income disparities.
 For instance, the dual-model (

\end_inset

- which serves as a middle path between public and privately funded education
 systems - may have addressed the demands for free-education but it does
 little to improve access to higher education for poorer students without
 the extension of credit (lending) facilities.
 We focus on wealth effects as an important consideration for education
 expenditure along with the relevant controls in the current chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also worth emphasising that there are obvious limits to what an education
 policy alone can achieve.
 The structural problems which the region faces have certain implications
 for education expenses that are outside the scope of a sound education
 policy.
 While local wealth disparities are important, a broad outlook towards education
 expenses in the region does need to consider the wider macro-economic context
 of the economies in the region.
 A few distinguishing aspects of the economies in the SSA are worth stating
 in this regard.
 First, the high-land labour ratios - a recurrent theme in the studies on
 SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersoninequalityandvariableSAA2004"

 inequality and migration-pressures in the region (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "KoseGhebruLandEthiopia2018"

 Second, the susceptibility of the region to volatilities in commodity prices
 remains particularly high (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "deatoncommoditypricesAfrica1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The presence of a large informal sector facing such uncertainities further
 constrains the funding for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

non-necessities
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 such as education that could depend on taxation or public finance.
 Finally, the political powers availed by the lower-income workforce - which
 an underdeveloped and commodity reliant industrial sector (

As many such factors are shared by both Nigeria and Tanzania, we have focused
 only on the contexts that differentiate the two economies in the current
 chapter.
 In particular, we note that Nigeria has had more investments in commodities
 sector (oil and petroleum) than Tanzania - which remains a relatively agrarian
 economy.
 Additionally, the policy of education has also been different in the two
 economies - with Tanzania having a history of restrictions of secondary
 education at a time when other countries in the region were expanding their
 education sector (

 that we detail in the subsequent sections while considering how wealth
 and urbanisation influence access to education in the two economies.

The main goal of our empirical analysis is to find out if with rise in urbanisat
ion, the wealth effects better explain the disparity in education expenses
 rather than urbanisation levels in the two economies.
 As mentioned earlier, we rely primarily on a wealth-concentration measure
 of urbanisation levels - while providing results from a formulation based
 on urban-rural indicators as a comparison.
 The private household income is set to be the logarithm of total expenditure
 while the wealth concentration measure - the second explanatory variable
 - is calculated as the average assets in the consumer's district (for smaller
 districts, the average over multiple districts within a 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 boundary is taken).
 In the alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators, the two explanator
y variables are the wealth based on durable goods from the survey and the
 urban-rural indicators themselves.
 The measures for wealth-concentration (as well as the first explanatory
 variable in the alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators) rely
 on the market-value of durable goods (including land, housing) that are
 reported in the survey (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 It is worth highlighting that the durable goods are considered as part
 of the consumer wealth only if they are transferable over generations.
 The ownership of goods that won't last more than a lifetime enter as consumptio
n for the household rather than as assets contributing to the intergenerational
 wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a simple econometric model, the representative household balances i)
 her non-durable consumption (excluding education) with ii) increasing expenditu
re on education for the children.
 The non-durable consumption that the household may spend on excludes the
 expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and non-durable consumption excluding assets-related-c
osts thus form the budget constraint for the econometric model.
 In this model for cross-sectional comparison of education expenses, we
 do not consider the substitution with savings towards durable goods.
 Other than our focus on cross-sectional effects, another reason why we
 avoid panel methods in the current study is a severe measurement error
 with time-varying household asset values in the survey (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

It is worth highlighting that the econometric analysis is limited for households
 having one or more children.
 In other words, only households with at least one member with their age
 less than 18 are considered in the analysis.
 Since the households with lower working age are likely to have less accumulatio
ns as well as needs, the average paternal age in the household is also used
 as a control in the comparison.
 The number of children (household-size), the educational level of the parents,
 the accessibility of schools in the district and the social characteristics
 of the household such as religion and language spoken are other important
 controls used in the analyses.
 Notice that for the paternal educational levels, we use an educational
 rank that is standardised by differentiating between primary, secondary
 and higher educational levels (see Section

The educational expenses and the non-asset related expenditures are obtained
 from the Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) which is conducted by
 the World Bank.
 The survey has been designed to assist in the understanding of links between
 asset ownership, community access (to market, schools), food prices and
 agriculture activities.
 The data in the surveys from multiple countries is largely uniform in its
 data-model (fields) and is often geo-referenced with a sufficiently wide-covera
ge in the country to allow a study of spatial variation in the observed
 variables.
 The years used for the analyses are the most recent years in the survey
 for Tanzania (2014) and Nigeria (2015) - i.e.
 the last waves available in the survey at the time of writing this chapter.

As described earlier, one of the interpretation of urbanisation is the wealth
 concentration - which is measured as the log-averages of the values of
 durable goods (calculated as per the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited, we focus on durable goods that can be transferred over a generation.
 For both Tanzania and Nigeria, we therefore include items as long-term
 assets only if they are costlier than furniture - which is the cheapest
 asset to be transferred between the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 These costs are used both for the wealth-concentration measures and the
 assets-measure.
 As explained earlier, the permanent-income measure uses the logarithm of
 total expenditure at the household level.

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data for Tanzania.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts for the
 wider level consumer vicinity based on Euclidean distance.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards
 in the 6 
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 vicinity (or the district boundary).

The physical access to education is measured using the distance to the nearest
 secondary school.
 More specifically, a score secondary_schools for each district represents
 the number of wards that have a secondary school within the 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 area.
 A district with a higher score has more wards that have a secondary school
 in close vicinity (within 6-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 vicinity).
 The score evidently factors in the high-population density in urban areas
 since densely populated districts would have more wards within the same
 geographical distance as a less populated district.

The next important control is the occupation of the households which is
 directly available for every individual in the survey.
 Whether an occupational sector is agriculture related or determined is
 based on the main occupation of household head.
 The number of children in the household, the ages of the children (and
 other members) are directly observed in the data.
 The paternal educational levels which are also an important control in
 the study are not based on education level of the household head.
 This is because a significant number of household units in both Tanzania
 and Nigeria are made up of joint families where the reported educational
 expenses correspond to the grandchildren of the household head (HH).
 To avoid letting the education levels point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and to the last generation where
 HH has younger children, we rely on the highest education rank in the paternal
 generation of the children recorded in the survey

Only relations with the household head are reported in the survey.
 Thus, there is no direct way of locating the parent of a child except through

To provide a uniform treatment to educational levels across both Tanzania
 and Nigeria, we use 4 education categories - setting the education rank
 to 1 for all pre-primary levels, to rank 2 for until the completion of
 primary education, to rank 3 for up to the secondary education level and
 to 4 for all higher education levels (higher-secondary, university etc.).
 These mappings are provided in Tables

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

\backslash
ref{education_rank_ngr}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (see Appendix).
 For instance, the primary school leaving exam is taken at D7 in Tanzania
 and corresponds to the education rank 2 ; all standards above D7 and before
 O course (Diploma) correspond to the education rank 3 and all education
 levels at or above O course correspond to education rank 4 for Tanzania.
 Similarly, the levels above P6 - which is the highest primary education
 level in Nigeria - implies an education rank 3 (corresponding to P6 in
 Tanzania) and all education levels at or above the technical training level
 (treated equivalent to Diploma level in Tanzania) are correspond to education
 rank 4.
 As access to private education may be significant in the urban-areas, we
 also use a control for private-education that is available in the survey.

The languages spoken (in Tanzania) and the religious-identity for household
 members - used as controls - are recorded at the individual's level in
 the survey data for the countries and are directly used as controls in
 the survey.
 To control for the price of consumption in the household's district, we
 also use the non-durable consumption averages excluding the costs associated
 with ownership of assets in the survey.
 This measurement of price is akin to the price-deflator (unit-value) methods
 used in the demand literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,TafereTaffesseEthiopia2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The rationale for excluding costs associated with assets is that the costs
 of maintaining assets (fees, repair costs, usage costs etc.) are not levied
 on those who don't own the related assets and should not be included in
 the general price of non-durable consumption.

Of the two economies, a higher percent of the GDP comes from agricultural
 production in Tanzania.
 The per-capita GDP 2020 for Nigeria (2396.04 USD) is much higher than that
 of Tanzania (976.16 USD) (source World Bank).
 As of 2020, Nigeria had a population of 206.1 million and Tanzania's population
 was 59.7 million (source: World Bank).
 The GDP from manufacturing, mining and construction is nearly double for
 Nigeria (8749.61 million USD in 2022) compared to Tanzania (4221.41 million
 USD in 2021).
 Nigeria's GDP from agriculture is 9311.36 million USD and Tanzania's is
 4313.47 million USD.
 Some structural differences and the differences in infrastructure in the
 two economies arise due to higher reliance on energy exports for Nigeria
 - which, as of 2020, exports $35.9 billion crude-gas and imports $7.75 billion
 of refined Petroleum apart from cars ($3.03 billion) and wheat ($2 billion).
 On the other hand, Tanzania's major exports are Gold and other minerals
 ($3 billion) followed by agricultural products (0.594$ billion).
 The major imports of Tanzania are refined copper and petroleum ($2.2B).
 Among the two economies, Nigeria relies less on the agrarian exports and
 more on the energy-related infrastructure - likely accounting for higher
 average education levels in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HistEducationRanks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The role of private education is also much higher in Nigeria (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in both the economies.
 More specifically, urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents
 in Nigeria whereas they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for education rank 3 (taken across all individua
ls with less than 18 age with education rank is almost double that of the
 expenditure on education rank 2 in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these expenditures rise by about 54%.
 The educational expenses do not seem to rise much with asset disparities
 in Nigeria - whereas they seem to be more unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartEducationbyAssetDeciles"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Comparing education levels of the household heads, we see that the average-educ
ation rank of the household heads in Tanzania (1.8) is lower than that in
 Nigeria(1.9).

The overall distribution of assets (durable goods stocks) in the two countries

 for in Nigeria and Tanzania, we note that distribution of assets is more
 sparse in Tanzania even though the overall expenditure appears similarly
 distributed in the two countries.

 (Nigeria) are based on the standardisation of various occupations in Tanzania
 and Nigeria.
 Since the range of occupations in the surveys from Tanzania and Nigeria
 is varied, the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria
 have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey so that
 a higher occupation rank represents an occupation that provides higher
 income.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and reporting of
 occupations in the surveys from both the countries

It is not uncommon for the empirical studies in SSA to have the data on
 occupation or education proxy the income differences (Alesina et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem
 that may be further aggravated because of a large informal sectors in the
 economies.
\end_layout

.
 The mapping from specific occupations to the occupation-ranks for Tanzania
 and Nigeria is shown in Table

 (respectively).
 A higher occupation rank represents occupations that bring higher income.
 As described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

, the education levels are also mapped to education ranks denoting primary,
 secondary and higher education (see Table

 A higher education rank corresponds to a higher education level.

While we undertake a more detailed view on education expenses in the Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the key observation from the data is that the disparities in income and
 durable goods are more localised in Nigeria while they are more extreme
 across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the disparity in durable-goods ownership across regions is not as extreme
 as in Tanzania.
 The particular interpretation of urbanisation is used to explain the implicatio
ns of this non-uniformity on consumption and educational expenses in Section

To reiterate, a significant number of household units in both the economies
 are made up of joint families where the reported educational expenses correspon
d to the grandchildren of the household head (HH).
 The education level of the HH would thus point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and the previous generation for
 younger households where HH has young children.
 To resolve this disparity, we avoid using the education rank of the HH
 and instead use the highest education rank in the generation of the students'
 parents

 causes a decrease in the budget share on education 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$

 This seems largely due to the educational expenses forming a higher proportion

 While the higher expenditure on education measured through total education
 expenditure logarithm 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 does seem to correspond to the prices of non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

 in Tanzania, the higher budget share of education cannot be attributed
 to higher consumption-prices - since the effect of non-durable consumption
 prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

 remains weak on education-budget share 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for both the economies.
 In other words, while urbanisation must also raise the prices of non-durable
 expenditure excluding asset-costs 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

, the disparity in budget shares does not appear to be due to higher cost
 of living (non-durable consumption) alone.

 Consider the education expenditures, the wealth concentration (

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"

\end_inset

), the access to private education is limited to the wealthier households
 in both the economies.
 Given the insignificant private-education indicator variable 
\family typewriter
educpriv
\family default
 observed with 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the education expenditure as dependent variable for Nigeria (see Table
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabTNZNGR_r}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ) , the differences in education expenditures between private and government
 education appear far less than one would expect for the country (even though
 the privately-educated households in Nigeria do have higher budget shares
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for education).
 As private education only accounts for a minority of the population in
 both the economies (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"

noprefix "false"

), the role of access to either or private or government secondary school
 i.e.
 the variable 
\family typewriter

 is more relevant for our comparison of education expenses in the two countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of access to secondary-schools on education budget shares 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$

 overall is far stronger for Tanzania where the consumers are more likely
 to spend on primary education (compare the coefficients for secondary-school
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 in particular, we see that the role of secondary-school

 is stronger for Nigeria when taking wealth i.e.
 total assets-worth logarithm 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
logA 
\family default
into account.
 The wealth effect is thus stronger than access in both the economies but
 is weaker for Nigeria where more household members enroll into secondary
 and tertiary education - regardless of the differences in long-term intergenera
tional wealth (measured with logarithm of assets-worth 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
logA
\family default
).
 The decomposed view of expenses on education in terms of secondary and
 primary education level is important for this observation and reflects
 the far lower attendance of secondary education in Tanzania.
 The role of the number of children 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
numchild
\family default
) seems stronger in Tanzania than in Nigeria - but that effect also seems
 likely due the education expenses driven by primary education in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another consequence of most households spending on primary education alone
 is that the agrarian households appear as spending higher on education
 after considering the wealth-concentration among households with the same
 educational-status.
 The education expenditure is higher for agrarian households in Tanzania
 after taking into account their poor educational status measured through
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (see coefficients of agrarian-occupation-indicator 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 as the dependent variable).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comparison of results using the wealth-concentration measure and the
 alternative formulation using urban-rural indicators suggests a particular
 limitation of the use of urban-rural indicators from the survey.
 The coefficients of rural-wards 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
rural_wards
\family default
) for education budget shares 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 are negative and significant for Tanzania in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabTNZNGR_urbanrural}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 However, the deduction of a higher expenditure on education - when using
 urban-rural indicators - by the rural residents in Nigeria (see significance
 of rural-wards 
\family typewriter

\family default

\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabTNZNGR_urbanrural}

 ) ignores the fact that the wards identified as rural in Nigeria may not
 be as rural as those identified as rural in Tanzania.
 This is confirmed with the weaker role of wealth i.e.
 assets-worth-logarithm 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)$
\end_inset

 (or 
\family typewriter
logA
\family default
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

 The wealth-concentration 
\family typewriter
r
\family default
 thus seems to provide a more clear-cut and standardised interpretation
 of urbanisation in the two economies than what may be provided using the
 survey's urban-rural classifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the wealth effects in Tanzania seems stronger, they ought to
 be considered in light the much lower enrollment levels in secondary (and
 higher) education and higher disparity in asset-ownership (even after taking
 into account the lower urbanisation levels) in Tanzania.
 The significance of logarithm of assets-worth 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)$
\end_inset

 ( 
\family typewriter
logA 
\family default
in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

) does indicate a general trend where those with higher inter-generational
 wealth and in urban areas are far more likely to avail the education facilities
, but a higher dependence on industrial output in Nigeria also seems to
 have contributed to a higher demand for secondary and tertiary education
 in the economy.
 The stronger role of father's education level in Tanzania seems also related
 to these disparities in the two economies.
 A comparison of education expenditures across the two countries must therefore
 take into account the different stages which the two countries appear to
 be in terms of urbanisation and economic development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the role of social environment is significant
 in both the economies.
 The role of English language seems significant in Tanzania - where the
 English-speakers spend significantly higher on education.
 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the educational expenses are higher among
 households identifying as Christian.
 In both cases, the role of social characteristics seems rather inseparable
 from the institutional differences towards education.
 In case of Tanzania, the ability to speak English is aligned with attending
 educational institutions while in Nigeria, the role played by Christian
 missionaries in establishment of educational may be reflected in the disparity
 of access to educational facilities.

As a first robustness check, we re-estimate the results with wealth concentratio

 i.e.
 assets-worth logarithm 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A)$

 The results demonstrate how the education expenditures (coefficients for

\begin_layout Standard
The role of social effects seems validated with these results as the significanc
e of social factors remains unaffected by whether the consumers have above
 or below the median asset ownership level.
 More specifically, the factor variables for english-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english
\family default
 and (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
religion 
\family default
) are significant in results from Tanzania and Nigeria (respectively) for
 both richer and poorer households.
 The factor variable for english-speaking ability 
\family typewriter
has_english
\family default
 is significant for consumers both above and below media asset possession
 level (the coefficient for variable 
\family typewriter
religion 
\family default
is significant for Nigeria for above and below median asset possession level
 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

).
 It is worth pointing out that the economic significance for religion (
 
\family typewriter

\family default
) in Nigeria is higher with 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 as dependent variable in Table

As one would expect, the effect of secondar-schools 
\family typewriter
secondary_schools
\family default
 is also the same for both richer and poorer halves of a given locality.
 While the role that the wealth-concentration 
\family typewriter
r
\family default
 plays towards access to education appears to be the same for the rich and
 poor halves in a locality as well, we do see a higher economic significance
 of wealth-concentration 
\family typewriter
r
\family default
 for the below-median-assets household in Nigeria - possibly because of
 high education costs in urban areas where asset-possession may be lower.
 The access to private education and to higher education favour the richer
 households in both economies - as the economic significance of private-educatio
n factor variable 
\family typewriter
educpriv 
\family default
is consistently higher for richer households as is the expenditure on tertiary
 level education in both the economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of children have a more significant effect for richer households
 in Tanzania.
 Given a lower participation in higher education in the country, this effect
 seems likely due to the primary-education needs scaling up with the number
 of children in the household.
 As in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Discussion"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the lower levels of average educational attainment in Tanzania seem to
 accentuate the effect of paternal education rank 
\family typewriter
fathers_educ_rank 
\family default
which has a higher statistical significance for poorer households in Tanzania
 (compare the coefficient of paternal education rank 
\family typewriter
fathers_educ_rank 
\family default
in Tanzania with educational-expenditure logarithm 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$

The second robustness check we use is the recomputation of wealth concentration
 by considering only those in the household's vicinity with the same value
 of the indicator for primary/higher-than-primary education-level of the
 household-head (and similar for the agrarian/non-agrarian occupation).
 Three types of vicinities are thus implied - that we summarise in the Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first interpretation is one that we have already described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Discussion"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 - where a simple average of the total assets owned by the households in
 the consumer's district is used.
 Both education rank and an agrarian-occupation factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the household head's occupation is agrarian or not are
 used as controls in this interpretation of the vicinity.
 The second interpretation of the vicinity presented as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{educ}$
\end_inset

 in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabTNZNGR_reduc}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is based on a supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 indicating whether the education level of the household-head is higher
 than primary school or not.
 More specifically, this second interpretation uses the prosperity within
 the educational levels implied by supra-primary factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is also used as the additional control in this second interpretation.
 Finally, the third interpretation of vicinity is based on the average prosperit
y in the agrarian vs non-agrarian occupations (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

) and uses educational rank as the additional control variable.
 The results from this third interpretion of vicinity are presented in Table

 (respectively) for Tanzania and Nigeria, we see again that while the wealth
 concentration corresponds to a rise in educational expenditure logarithm
 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$

 Further, since the coefficients for secondary-age indicator

 seem higher for the agrarian/non-agrarian vicinity (i.e.

 agrarian or non-agrarian occupations than by education levels the populations
 have attained.

We had set ourselves to test if local wealth effects are more important
 than urbanisation levels for education expenses in two economies of the
 SSA where the dependence on the industrial output is higher for one than
 for the other.
 While there are idiosyncratic differences between the two countries we've
 used for our comparison, there are some implications for the education
 policy in the region as the countries undergo higher economic development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the agrarian consumers maintain a higher budget share on education
 expenses in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and higher education ranks consistent
ly correspond to higher education expenses in the more developed economy
 (Nigeria), the educational expenses are likely to remain higher after attainmen
t of education in the population with increase in regional prosperity.
 This also seems aligned with the recent finding from a cohort-study by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that the labour with skills added through education is less willing to
 stay in agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main findings that can be highlighted from our results.
 First, the effects of urbanisation levels - whether interpreted as wealth
 concentration or as urban-rural indicators from the survey - are significant
 on education expenses in both the economies.
 Second, the lower wealth continues to prevent access to education and mobility
 in both the economies - even though rises in education expenses are inevitable
 as the employment opportunities increase in an economy.
 In light of both the findings, we observe that the wealth effects are less
 extreme in the higher developed economy (i.e.
 Nigeria) than in the less developed economy (i.e.
 Tanzania).
 In other words, wealth effects - after accounting for urbanisation - appear
 to become weaker with rise in urbanisation.
 A rise urbanisation seems to be associated with weaker wealth effects and
 may indicate the conventional pathway to equity in both income and equality
 (

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, however, the importance of urbanisation should not discount the
 need for policy to improve access to education for the lower and middle-income
 populations in the region.
 This is of crucial importance also because the private educational institutions
 - which are more common in Nigeria - do not yet play a major role in the
 provision of education in the region.
 Instead, a more significant role continues to be played by the state-institutio
ns in both the economies.
 The improvement of access to education is relevant also due to the issues
 of social exclusion that are indicated by the relevance of social characteristi
cs in education expenses for both the economies.
 These findings are aligned with the wider observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who elaborate on the significant role of religious and colonial institutions
 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the development of the education sectors seems to be at different
 stages of development in the Tanzania and Nigeria.
 The privatisation of education in Nigeria seems to have coincided with
 higher attendance of universities in a way that is yet to be seen for Tanzania
 - where education has not expanded as much just yet.
 While the wealth effects seem strong in both the economies, the relevance
 of wealth-concentration in the population having higher education levels
 points to a promising direction where more urbanisation could improve access
 to both education and employment opportunities in the region.
