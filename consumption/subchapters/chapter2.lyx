Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
In the context of developing economies in sub-Saharan Africa, is the spending
 on education more often determined by wealth of the household's area of
 residence than by the permanent income of the household?

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%[DEMAND Question] - Wealth effects are like gravity for education attainment
 - but leaving pointing to a general relevance of social factors is not
 an option.
 Given that we consider both Nigeria and Tanzania (focusing on NGR alone
 is an option), the urbanisation - which is a major supply side issue -
 should be seen highlighted as a measure that compares with the direct measure
 of educational institutitions are spread in the country.
 Only thing that is important is the wealth effect - which has two effects
 - quality of education and social exclusion.
 We don't have a measure for quality - so we focus only on higher expenditure
  on education after controlling for non-durable consumption prices in the
 region (i.e.
 if consumer spend more on education with respect to other non-durable expenditu
re relative to non-durable expenditure).
 The second issue is to understand if wealth may be limited access to higher
 levels of education.
 The lower demand for education could either be due to low returns to education
 or due to wealth limiting access.
 As returns to education is not availalbe to us, we are interested only
 if wealth is preventing access and therefore causes some degree of social
 exclusion both through wealth (price of education and wealth) and social
 factors relevant to wealth.

% To minimise clutter, we can remove the logX and argue that we intend to

 logits could be provided but if we're interested in the expenses, then
 dummy variables indicating child.in.primary and child.in.secondary might also
 suffice.
 We could further minimise by looking at secondary alone.
 The length of time the students stay in school for (overall) is not available
 for a large part of the population.

% As such there is little dichotomoy, since the effects are significant
 for both.
 One option is to see who has higher wealth effect.
  Even for those who are convinced of the dichotomy between the effect of
 private wealth effect vs urbanisation, more interesting details of segregation
 (are consumers really being segregated by urban areas needs to be clarified
 - the measure of urbanisation/wealth concentration/school access drives
 this.

The participation rates for secondary and higher education remain one of
 the lowest in the economies of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
 Education seems both inaccessible to a vast population and inadequate in
 providing mobility to those with low-income in the SSA (

key "dabalenNigeriaUnemployment2001,oketchAfricaHE2016,NdyaliHE_Unemployment_TNZ2016,MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

 The suppressed demand for education in the region has been argued to be
 both due to lower returns to education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

\end_inset

 ) and due to barriers to education access imposed due to wealth differences
 (

LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,IliePaulineWhobenefitsfromHE2018"

\end_inset

).
 The presence of a strong wealth would suggest that a policy to improve
 returns to education may not improve access to education significantly.
 With a focus on the role of extreme wealth differences on education expenses,
 therefore, the current chapter compares the role of household prosperity
 and regional inequalities brought about by uneven economic development
 in Tanzania and Nigeria - the two representative countries in the SAA with
 disparate levels of urbanisation and dependence on agrarian production.

The role that parental educational levels and household wealth play in education
 attainment (esp at higher levels of education) has been highlighted in
 much of the literature on education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "WuZhangUnequalEduc2008,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999,GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,SpaullPovertyEducSA2013"

 The human capital perspective on educational attainment views them as accumulat
ions that can be transferred to the progeny (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BeckerTomesEquilibMobility1979"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In this sense, the education inequalities are not too different from long-term
 asset inequalities and may arise due to an uneven economic development
 leading to wider urban-rural differences as well as due to expensive higher
 education institutions that remain out of reach for the lower-income households.
 In other words, the wealth effect on education - similar to the inequalities
 of income and assets - can be both i) localised i.e.
 varied across permanent income within a given vicinity or ii) endemic i.e
 varied across wider urban (developed) are rural (under-developed) areas
 (

While the severity of urban-rural inequalities in the SAA have prompted
 some to argue that the schooling system in the developing economies of
 the region may not be appropriate for the sparsely populated areas (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChernichovskySESEnrollment1985"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the physical accessibility of education opportunities has often been
 noted to be less significant than the wealth effects that tend to dominate
 through several channels - the information symmetries that favour investment
 decisions and job-searches for the wealthier households, the better representat
ion in nascent political institutions, social-differences that coexist with
 wealth differences and the higher risk-aversion for wealthier consumers
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Such inequalities are perpetuated when there is a lack of free education
 opportunities, letting the greater intergenerational wealth help fund higher
 education levels and creating a poverty trap where wealth differences directly
 contribute to education inequalities (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004,BehrmanVietnamEduc1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In the context of SAA, the social exclusion is further exacerbated due
 to the predominance of a large informal sector in many of the economies
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KakumOlimNairobiSegregation2007,OwusuGhanaSegregation2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The relative importance of wealth for education expenses in the two economies
 is thus of key importance to us in the current chapter.
 Other than the household wealth, the concentration of wealth in the sparse
 urban areas - where the bulk of employment opportunities for the highly
 educated reside - is also an important control in the study.
 In other words, the sparsity of education opportunities isn't view merely
 as physical access to education recorded in the survey but also as the
 effect of regional differences in prosperity and the degree of urbanisation.
 In the empirical analyses that follows in the subsequent sections, we compare
 the cross-sectional effects of household prosperity and regional differences
 on education expenses in Tanzania and Nigeria.
 Notice that the issues of intra-household allocation of educational expense
 among children are not considered in this analysis.

For a comparison of wealth effects, the empirical studies often prefer the
 measurement of ownership of assets (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) rather than household income since the inter-generational transfers of
 wealth make a break in the inequality gap (mobility through reduction of
 wealth differences) difficult (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ObasuyiEducationInequality2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, the use of total expenditure as permanent income is
 also common in studies on consumption (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 In the current chapter, we opt to compare the use of both the logarithm
 of owned assets (durable goods) and the permanent income based on the logarithm
 of total expenditure as controls for household wealth.
 Notice that the use of wealth-indices based on the stock of durable goods
 (excluding short-term durable goods that are not transferred over a generation)
 is also common in the studies from health and household economics (

key "HoweHargreavesWealthIndices2008,HoweHargreavesWealthIndexComparison2010,McKenzie2005,BooysenVanderbergAssetIndex2008"

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure the access to education opportunities, we use the physical access
 provided in the survey along with the measure of levels of urbanisation.
 The urbanisation levels are in turn measured in two different ways.
 First, we use a 'ruralness' score that is assigned to a district based
 on the number of wards (that a district is composed of ) declared as rural
 in the survey.
 Second, we use the measure of wealth (assets) concentration in the consumer's
 vicinity.
 The wealth concentration measures are detailed further by varying the definitio
ns of households vicinity and considering the household's neighborhood of
 similar occupations (agrarian/non-agrarian) and education ranks (primary,second
ary).
 Notice that the population density based approaches are avoided in the
 study due to the problems noted in the literature with highly populated
 rural areas in SSA economies (see

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the education enrolments often rise with number of children (rather
 than small families having higher chances of school enrollment - 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChernichovskySESEnrollment1985,MaralaniHsizerelEduc2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ), we also consider the role of number of children on household's education
 expenditure.
 Other important controls used in the comparison of educational expenses
 are the education level of the household head (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TanselParentEducEffects1997"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and the agrarian/non-agrarian primary occupation in the household.
 The effects of urban-rural differences and wealth on social exclusion as
 well as access to education opportunities have also been noted by the macroecon
omic comparisons for the region (

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 The inequalities in factor endowments in SSA (such as high land-labour
 ratios) have - for example - been used to explain the context of economic
 inequalities in the SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersoninequalityandvariableSAA2004"

 The literature has also highlighted the role of religion and social identities
 for distribution of household wealth and education distribution(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CorrayPotrafkeGenderPolitics2011,AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

 Identifying the role of social identities in the current chapoter, we use
 the empirical result to explain how wealth effects, social identities and
 sparsity of education opportunities may account for differences in education
 expenditures in the two economies.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The disparities in wealth inequalities have evident implications both for
 education mobility and migration pressures in the economies of SSA.
 More particularly, if the costs of living and amenities are less varied
 across the economy, then a consumer may be indifferent between staying
 in a poorer area and moving to a richer area with higher relative poverty.
 This indifference changes when the areas of residence are extremely dissimilar
 in terms of opportunities - that often result in asymmetrical human capital
 investments (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corakintergenerationalmobility2004"

\end_inset

) and higher segregation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In the current examination of the two countries that compares the effects
 of household wealth and access to education opportunities, we do find some
 evidence of such a segregation in the poorer of the two economies (TODO:
 add more conclusion).

While education may not be counted as the basic necessities of an individual
 in every poverty-measurement survey, it is seldom disputed that a lack
 of education contributes to poverty.
 The significance of education is summarised well by the suggestion from

 that - there is ‘‘no well educated literate population that is poor, [and]
 there is no illiterate population that is other than poor’’.
 Even the poorest individuals seem to have a strong demand for education.
 The literature for the developing economies also confirms a significant
 willingness to pay for education among the poor -

 It is not surprising therefore that despite many debates on public expenditure
 on education policy, both the human capital perspective (

The policy discussions on the choice between provision of free basic education
 to all (at the point of use) and investments in higher education have entailed
 some of the most heated debates on education in developing economies (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanLDCOECDSchoolAchievements1980"

 Those proposing the prioritisation of basic education point out that the
 role of primary and secondary education has been more important for growth
 in LDC nations than in OECD economies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "petrakisgrowtheduc2002"

) and that the contribution of higher educational levels should increase
 gradually as the level of development increases (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 It has also been recommended (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsacharopoulosFinancingEducLDC1986"

 education while letting higher education be privately funded.
 Some of the criticism (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - in particular - argues that the positive externalities from education
 are not factored into the productivity measures often used to argue against
 investments in higher education.
 That the individuals benefit culturally and physically from education -
 while reducing the costs of imparting social changes is ignored when using
 a returns-of-education approach.
 It seems that not only does formal education help workers pick up more
 skills on their own (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 in the labour market (see

 of education (see

 for example), it is generally agreed that the relationships between education

 While the wealth effects are found significant for economies in SSA (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that have resulted in a high unemployment among graduates and a relatively
 low participation of higher education.
 On one hand, the literature suggests institutional problems and mismanagement
 in public education (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) that may have led to insufficient gains in economic growth from education.
 On the other hand, it is also suggested that a focus on policy that is
 further from skills needed in an informal economy has resulted in poor
 agricultural productivity (see

Thus despite the criticism received by the returns-to-education approaches,
 a returns-from-education perspective may be helpful in answering whether
 the demand for education is suppressed due to poor chances of mobility
 or not.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 point, the lower demand for education in a developing economy can be either
 due to poorer returns from education or due to prevention of access to
 higher education due to insufficient wealth.
 If education enrollments are better explained with physical access, then
 the returns-to-education are less likely to be an issue that the policy
 needs to address.
 In other words, if higher access invariably results in high enrollment,
 then improving returns-to-education is less important improving access.
 On the other hand, a strong wealth effect suggests that improving access
 may not address the economic constraint that prevents access to education.
 Empirical studies in the SAA have often found physical access less significant
 than the wealth effects (

 Inspecting the enrollments data, for example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChernichovskySESEnrollment1985"

\end_inset

 note that the children from households that have large cattle stocks face
 less reductions in enrollment, because higher wealth may allow the households
 to take care of the cattle and prevent the childrens' withdrawals from
 schools.
 Using a benefit incidence analysis to test if the education is pro-rich,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 show that the poor young people receive only 5% of funds allocated to tertiary
 education compared with 54% for the rich.
 The effects of physical access - however - evidently become stronger at
 higher (secondary and tertiary) levels of education (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NgwareOnsomuKenyaSecEd2006"

 One caveat with the use of education enrollment data is that they are often
 not considered rigorous for empirical assessments - as they ignore the

The attributions to various causes for inadequacies of education policy
 are hardly contrasting in the context of SSA - since both the pro-rich
 nature of education and an insufficient focus on industrial productivity
 can together contribute to the limited gains in productivity from education.
 While the dual-model (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in the late last century, it has had limited success in improving access

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MinnisNonformalEducation2006"

\end_inset

 suggest that the expansionist policies for education have created education
 as a status commodity where the poor are likely to stay unemployed after
 graduating.
 The lack of sufficient loan facilities amidst political uncertainties in
 the region also seem to contribute to the limited access to higher education
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oketchAfricaHE2016,JohnstoneHEAccessAfrica2004"

\end_inset

).
 Further, it would be an understatement to say that the structural problems
 which the region faces cannot be addressed by a sound education policy
 alone.
 Considering the overall consumption pressures, for example, the region
 stands out in its susceptibility to commodity price volatilities (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The presence of a large informal sector severely constrains the funding

 As the economies in the region increasingly rely on commodity trading,
 the lower-income workforce continues to await its political empowerment.

 economy (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 but the immense competition with China's producers has also meant that
 an underdeveloped local industrial sector fails to absorb the lower-income

For the particular contexts of Nigeria and Tanzania, we note that Nigeria

 Tanzania - which remains a relatively agrarian economy.

 a time when other countries in the region were expanding their education
 sector (see

The goal of our empirical analysis is to find out if the wealth effects
 in one of the two economies are more significant for expenditure on education
 than the urbanisation levels - measured either as concentration of wealth
 or urban-rural indicators in the survey.
 For measurement of wealth, we compare the role of permanent income measure
 as total expenditure and the wealth measured from durable goods in the
 survey.
 Notice that the durable goods are considered as part of the consumer wealth
 only if they are transferable over generations.
 The ownership goods of that won't last more than a life time enter as consumpti
on for the household.

The wealth concentration measure - used side-by-side with the urban-rural
 indicators - are calculated as the average assets in the consumer's district

 This relies on the market-value of durable goods (including land, housing)

In a simple econometric model considered in the chapter, the representative
 household balances i) her consumption with ii) increasing expenditure on
 education for the children.
 The non-durable consumption that the consumer may spend on excludes the
 expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and non-durable consumption excluding assets-related-c
osts thus form the budget constraint for the model.
 Further, the cross-sectional comparison of expenses does not consider the
 substitution with savings towards durable goods.

 in the district/ward and the social characteristics of the household such
 as religion and language spoken are other important controls in our empirical

 The second interpretation is based on a factor variable

 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable

 Finally, the third interpretation is based on the average prosperity in

\begin_layout Standard
The second regression uses the logarithm of educational expenses 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$

 as the dependent variable against the same set of control variables.
 While the appearance of educational expenses both in the dependent variable
 and in the logarithm of the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 (used as the control variable) may cause some endogeneity, it does not
 interfere with our interest in the comparison of relative of effects of

The educational expenses and the non-asset related expenditures are obtained
 from the Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) which is conducted by
 the World Bank.
 The years used for the analyses are 2012-2014 for Tanzania and 2012-2015
 for Nigeria.
 While the data for consumption diaries are available also for 2010 in both
 Nigeria and Tanzania survey, we ignore the year 2010 due the value of assets
 being unavailable for Tanzania in the year 2010.

As described earlier, we interpret urbanisation as the asset concentration
 - and measure it simple as the log-averages of the values of durable goods
 (calculated as per the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited through, we focus on durable goods that can be transferred over
 a generation.
 For both Tanzania and Nigeria, we therefore included items as long-term
 assets only if they are costlier than furniture - which is the cheapest
 asset to be transferred between the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data for Tanzania.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts for the
 wider level consumer vicinity based on Euclidean distance.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards
 in the 6

Of the two economies, a higher percent of the GDP comes from agricultural
 production in Tanzania.
 The per-capita GDP 2020 for Nigeria (2396.04 USD) is much higher than that
 of Tanzania (976.16 USD) (source World Bank).
 As of 2020, Nigeria had a population of 206.1 million and Tanzania's population
 was 59.7 million (source: World Bank).
 The GDP from manufacturing, mining and construction is nearly double for
 Nigeria (8749.61 million USD in 2022) compared to Tanzania (4221.41 million
 USD in 2021).
 Nigeria's GDP from agriculture is 9311.36 and Tanzani'as 4313.47 million
 USD.
 Some structural differences in the two economies could be attributed to
 higher reliance on energy exports in Nigeria - which, as of 2020, exports
 $35.9 billion crude and gas and top imports $7.75 buillion of refined Petroleum
 apart from cars ($3.03 billion), and wheat ($2 billion).
 On the other hand, Tanzania major exports are Gold and other minerals ($3
 billion) followed by agricultural products (0.594$ billion).
 The major imports of Tanzania are refined copper and petroleum ($2.2B).
 Among the two economies, Nigeria relies less on the agrarian exports and
 more on the energy-related infrastructure - resulting in higher average
 education levels in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HistEducationRanks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The role of private education is also much higher in Nigeria (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in both the economies.
 More specifically, urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents
 in Nigeria whereas they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for education rank 3 is almost double that
 of the expenditure on education rank 2 in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these costs rise by about 54%.
 The educational expenses do not seem to rise much with asset disparities
 in Nigeria - whereas they seem to be more unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing the overall distribution of assets, we see that while the overall
 poverty may appear similar in Nigeria and Tanzania, the disparity in owned
 assets is far more extreme in Tanzania (particularly between the south
 of the country and the east - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"

 for Nigeria and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for Tanzania).
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"

 less extreme in Nigeria (see Figure

 The inequality in expenditure on non-durable consumption - on the other
 hand - is not as different for the two economies.
 This can be verified with the Lorenz curves for total non-durable expenditure
 and total assets in Figure

 Since the range of occupations in the surveys from Tanzania and Nigeria
 is varied, the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria
 have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and reporting of
 occupations in the surveys from both the countries

 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem

To understand the urban-rural differences, we compare the fulfillment of
 basic needs in urban vs rural areas using the fraction of consumers that
 have run out of food in the last 12 months in every district across both
 economies (either due to lack of agricultural inputs or high prices) in
 Figures

 These indicate a significant number of households running out of food in
 urban areas (due to high costs) - even though the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons).
 The average consumer in the urban areas for both the economies - despite
 better options for lifestyle and consumption - seems to struggle with basic
 needs.
 The estimation in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 further explores if education expenses are significantly impacted by permanent
 income while quantifying the degree of urbanisation as concentration of
 long-term durable goods rather depending on the rural-urban indicator variable
 alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we undertake a more detailed view on education expenses in the Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Results"

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the key observation from the non-parametric view of the data is that the
 disparities in income and durable goods are more localised in Nigeria while
 they are more extreme across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure

Control Variables
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that some of these controls are observed at the individual household
 level.
 One such variable is the logarithm of total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
logx
\family default
) - which is used as the control for permanent income in the estimation.
 The relationship between total household expenditures and the household’s
 permanent income is comes from standard consumption theory (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).

It is worth highlighting that in both the economies, a significant number
 of household units are made up of joint families where the reported educational
 expenses are correspond to the grandchildren of the household head (HH).
 The education level of the HH would thus point to the penultimate generation
 for households where HH has grandchildren and the previous generation for
 younger households where HH has young children.
 To resolve this disparity, we avoid using the education rank of the HH
 and use the highest education rank in the generation the children's parents

Only relations with the household head are reported in the survey.
 Thus, there is no direct way of locating the parent of a child except through
 the relation with the household-head.

 This parental educational level suffices for the analysis of expenditure
 spent over all the children in the household (rather than how education
 budget is distributed among the children).
 As mentioned in the Section

A goal of the empirical analysis is to find out if the educational expenses
 in the two economies rise more sharply as a result of higher prosperity
 consumer's locality (urbanisation level measured as concentration of long-term
 durable goods) rather the higher permanent income (measured as logarithm
 of total expenditure) and the education rank of the household.
 The empirical results also contrast the relative effects of wider and local

 suggest that an increase in 
\family typewriter

\family default
- causes a decrease in the the budget share on education 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 This may be largely due to the educational expenses forming a higher proportion
 of the total expenditure for poorer households - so we evaluate the 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 regressions (see Tables

 ) which suggest that the education expenditures rise with the increase
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 The higher budget share of education is not solely due to higher urban
 prices in general - since the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

 remains weak on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for both the economies (as urbanisation must also raises the prices of

The higher prosperity of districts (or urbanisation) increases educational

 drop with rising prosperity for Tanzania whereas they rise for Nigeria
 (see Tables

 This is true for other interpretations of the vicinity i.e.
 
\family typewriter

as well (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The more prosperous regions thus maintain higher expenditures on education
 in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite private education being more important in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the access to private education is limited to the wealthier population
 in both the economies.
 As private education only accounts for a minority of the population (see
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), this seems to confirm the findings that higher education is not provided
 by private institutions in the region.
 The less surprising observation that more children increase the total expenditu
re is supported for both the economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note also that in Tanzania - with a higher disparity in asset-ownership
 and less urbanisation - the agrarian households seem to be spending higher
 on education (compare the coefficients of

) - esp considering the prosperity of households with the same educational-statu
s (
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 i.e.
 having higher than primary education or not).
 The education expenditure is thus higher for agrarian households in Tanzania

We had set ourselves to understand how urbanisation levels may segregate
 education expenses (and thus future mobility) in two economies in the sub-Sahar
an Africa that differ in the level of urbanisation and income disparities.
 The results find significant effects of urbanisation levels - intepreted
 as concentration of durable goods - on education expenses in both the economies.
 The role of permanent income does seem weaker in Nigeria - where urbanisation
 is more likely to cause difference in education expense.
 In Tanzania, on the other hand, the role of permanent income is stronger.
 While private education seems more common in Nigeria, the state-provided
 education plays the dominant role in both the economies.
 It cannot be ruled out that higher urbanisation and the rise in incomes
 as well as education expenses with an expansion of education sector could
 allow private institutions to play a larger role in secondary education
 in either of the economies.

The results highlighting the significance of language and religion share

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - who have highlighted the role of religious and colonial institutions
 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.
 Further, as the agrarian consumers maintain a higher budget share on education
 expenses in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and higher education ranks consistent
ly correspond to higher education expenses in the more developed economy
 (Nigeria), it would appear that the educational expenses remain higher
 after attainment of education by the consumers and increase in regional
 prosperity.
 This seems aligned with the cohort-study from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who suggest that the labour with skills added through education is less
 willing to stay in agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In view of the structural differences in the two economies, the separation
 of opportunities for education and mobility in Tanzania seem strong with
 agrarian occupations lagging far behind relative to the urban areas.
 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the level of urbanisation and access to
 education are generally higher with the differences in education expenditure
 brought about through regional differences and religious institutions.
 There are thus two main conclusions we arrive at using the above results.
 First, the urbanisation - considering the two economies - does appear to
 be strongly associated with higher educational expenses.
 Second, while overall educational levels and expenses do rise with prosperity
 (as in Nigeria), the access to education as a means for mobility are likely
 to remain susceptible to social factors and long-term assets inequalities.
