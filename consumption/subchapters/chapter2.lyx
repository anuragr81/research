\begin_layout Plain Layout

%[DEMAND Question] - Wealth effects are like gravity for education attainment.
 urbanisation is merely a supply side issue measures how quality educational
 institutitions are spread in the country.
 The idea low returns to education could be suppressing the demand (or if
 wealth itself limits access) can be brought to the center.
 The spread of education institutions is directly measured - this a control
 that goes side-by-side wealth concentration/urbanisation.
 If there are no schools, then there is no expenditure.
 The zero expenditure on education needs to be explained.
 So the effects need to consider these controls directly too.
 Therefore, while the both wealth concentration and urbanisation are different
 in the two economies and each are of significance in their own economies,
 a lot of factors such as social factors and development factors come in.
 The social exclusion theory could help discuss how different groups of
 people have different education needs and mobility.

% As such there is little dichotomoy, since the effects are significant
 for both.
 We can talk only if they are stronger in one economy than the other.
  Even for those who are convinced of the dichotomy between the effect of
 private wealth effect vs urbanisation, the test of segregation needs to
 be cleared.
 How is the measure of urbanisation (wealth concentration) addressing the
 distribution of education opportunities.

% Counterquestions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 1.
 What about children being mixed with adults?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 2.
 What about children in different age-groups - should we not consider that
 the expense on them are different - is mean child age enough?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 3.
 If we're talking about demand and particularly since we're measuring weights,
 the expectation is that we're investigate whether consumers are spending
 more on education in response to something (gender, wealth) etc.
 or not.
 But urbanisation or wealth concentration are less obvious and the story
 needs to be motivated better or connected to the model better.

The participation rates for secondary and higher education remain one of

 The policy interest in addressing the inequalities in education motivates
 our investigation of the effects of household permanent income and the
 regional wealth inequalities on education expenditure in Tanzania and Nigeria

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The importance of education for economic growth as well as the limitations
 that income inequalities pose to education access have been of immense
 interest to policy (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,TilakEducationPoverty2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The interest has also sparked some heated debates.
 One of the points of contention in the literature has been the relative
 importance of private wealth against that of innate ability on educational
 performance in schools - with many empirical studies reporting that socio-econo
mic status (SES) may be of less importance for educational performance in
 poorer economies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heynemanloxleyeffect1983"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Another point of contention has been the suggested preference for provision
 of basic education over investments in higher education based on returns-to-edu
cation approaches.
 We attempt to shed some light on these issues in the context of sub-Saharan
 Africa by exploring how disparities on education expenses across all education
 levels (obtained from consumption diaries in the Living Standard Measurement
 Study) in two economies may relate with the regional wealth concentration,
 household characteristics and the extent to which education is supported
 by private or religious institutions.

The role that parental educational levels and household wealth play in access
 to education (esp at higher levels of education) have been highlighted
 in much of the literature (cite examples

 Viewed as human capital, education attainment is often modeled as an accumulati

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The inequalities which varied education levels create are thus not unlike
 the asset inequalities that result due to socio-economic differences in
 an economy.
 In the context of a developing economies, the wealth inequalities are often
 due to strong urban-rural differences arising out of long-term economic
 development.
 Some have argued that the schooling system adopted in many developing economies
 is not one that is appropriate for sparsely populated areas.

 Even though education is often physically accessible (cite: literature),
 several other factors such as - different investment decisions, favouring

 Similar to the inequalities of income and assets, the dependence of education
 inequalities on wealth differences can be localised i.e.
 varied across permanent income within a given vicinity or regional i.e varied
 across wider urban are rural regions (

 Studies often prefer the measurement of wealth rather than income inequalities
 since inter-generational transfers of wealth make a break in the inequality
 gap difficult

 In the particular contexts of a developing economies, industrialisation
 has been recent, urban areas where the bulk of employment opportunities
 for the highly educated reside are relatively sparse and result in vast
 rural-urban differences that contribute to differential access to education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current chapter focuses on the relative effect of household prosperity
 and its concentration in urbanised regions in the two economies.
 In the empirical analyses that follows in subsequent sections, we compare
 cross-sectional effects of total household expenditure and concentration
 of wealth on education expenses in the two economies.
 The issues of intra-household allocation of educational expense among children
 are not considered in this analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use multiple measures of household prosperity and wealth concentration
 to in order to perform the comparison of the effects of household prosperity
 and wealth concentration.
 For household prosperity, we use the total household expenditure first
 and then the stock of long-term durable goods owned by the households -
 both of which have been used in the literature for measures of the wealth
 effect (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc1999,FilmerPritchettWealthEffectonEduc2001"

).
 The use of total household expenditure to measure permanent income (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GlewweJacobyEconGrowthEducDemandWealthEffects2004"

\end_inset

) is motivated using arguments from standard consumption theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and the wealth-indices used in both health and household economics are
 commonly built based on the observed stock of durable goods (

key "HoweHargreavesWealthIndices2008,HoweHargreavesWealthIndexComparison2010,McKenzie2005,BooysenVanderbergAssetIndex2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 To measure the concentration of wealth, we use both the average stock of
 long-term durable goods (excluding short-term durable goods that are not
 transferred over a generation) in the consumer's vicinity and the urban-rural
 indicators provided in the survey.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the urban-rural differences that are commonly emphasised for
 education inequalities (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AgrawalEducIneqRuralUrbanIndia2014"

\end_inset

), our exploration of wealth concentration (i.e.
 assets including land ownership) banks upon the emphasis that sociological
 literature has placed on the network of occupations and social networks
 attached with assets in sub-Saharan African societies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoseGhebruLandEthiopia2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The inequalities in factor endowments in SAA (such as high land-labour
 ratios) have also been highlighted in cross-country comparisons of inequalities
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AndersoninequalityandvariableSAA2004"

 Notice that the population density based approaches for urbansiation are

.
 The the urban-rural indicator being observed at the ward level in the survey
 (a district being composed of multiple wards), we consider the higher number
 of wards that are recorded as rural in the survey as a measure of being
 rural.
 To explain the role of inequalities, we also consider the wealth concentration
 among households with similar occupations (agrarian/non-agrarian) and education
 ranks (primary,secondary and tertiary).

 Other important controls used in the comparison of educational expenses
 are the education level of the household head 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the access to education in the district and the agrarian/non-agrarian

 Given that enrolment often rises with number of children (rather than small
 families having higher chances of school enrolment -

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The disparities in wealth inequalities have evident implications both for
 education mobility and migration pressures in the SAA economies.
 More particularly, if the costs of living and amenities are less varied
 across the economy, then a consumer may be indifferent between staying
 in a poorer area and moving to a richer area with higher relative poverty.
 This indifference changes when the areas of residence are extremely dissimilar
 in terms of opportunities - that often result in asymmetrical human capital
 investments (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corakintergenerationalmobility2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and higher segregation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ReardonBischoffIneqSeg2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In the current examination of the two countries that compares the effects
 of permanent income and concentration of wealth, we do find some evidence
 of such a segregation in the poorer of the two economies i.e.
 Tanzania.

While education may not be counted as the basic necessities of an individual

 The significance of education is summarised well by the suggestion from

 that - there is â€˜â€˜no well educated literate population that is poor, [and]
 there is no illiterate population that is other than poorâ€™â€™.
 Even the poorest individuals seem to have a strong demand for education.
 The literature for the developing economies also confirms a significant
 willingness to pay for education among the poor - 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

The policy discussions on the choice between provision of free basic education
 to all (at the point of use) and investments in higher education have entailed
 some of the most heated debates on education in developing economies (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeynemanHistoryProblemsWorldBank2003,heynemanLDCOECDSchoolAchievements1980"

).
 Those proposing the prioritisation of basic education point out that the
 role of primary and secondary education has been more important for growth
 in LDC nations than in OECD economies (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "petrakisgrowtheduc2002"

) and that the contribution of higher educational levels should increase
 gradually as the level of development increases (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 It has also been recommended (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsacharopoulosFinancingEducLDC1986"

 education while letting higher education be privately funded.
 Some of the criticism (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - in particular - argues that the positive externalities from education
 are not factored into the productivity measures often used to argue against
 investments in higher education.
 That the individuals benefit culturally and physically from education -
 while reducing the costs of imparting social changes is ignored when using
 a returns-of-education approach.
 It seems that not only does formal education help workers pick up more
 skills on their own (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FullerVocationalTraining1976"

), the skills provided by secondary or higher education may be often necessary
 in the labour market (see

 While the returns-to-education approach is often used to explain the impact
 of education (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 for example), it is generally agreed that the relationships between education
 and labour markets are more complex than a simple function of the increased
 productivity of educated workers (see

 The literature on SAA economies therefore offers two differing views on
 failures in education policy that have resulted in a high unemployment
 among graduates and a relatively low participation of higher education.
 On one hand, the literature suggests institutional problems and mismanagement
 in public education (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "languilleeducbudgetpolitics2019"

) that may have led to insufficient gains in economic growth from education.
 On the other hand, it is also suggested that a focus on policy that is
 further from skills needed in an informal economy has resulted in poor
 agricultural productivity (see

The inequalities in a typical developing economy entail both a wide geographical
 disparity in wealth and more local differences in income.
 In other words, one finds both that some regions of a developing economy
 are much poorer (richer) than others and that extreme income differences
 persist within a particular area.
 The current chapter considers if the disparities in urbanisation levels
 - measured as concentration of higher durable goods that can be transferred
 over generations - affect the educational expenses of a consumer household.

The reason why we consider durable goods transferred over generations is
 that the sense of wealth considered for urbanisation is meant to exclude
 goods consumption that enters the consumption which the educational expenses
 are a part of.
 The averages of assets are calulated at in the consumer's district (for
 smaller districts, the average over multiple districts within a 6-

 The market-value of durable goods (including land, housing) used in the
 average are directly observed in the data (see Section

In the simple econometric model considered in the chapter, the representative
 consumer balances i) increasing her consumption with ii) expenditure on
 education.
 The cross-sectional comparison of expense does not consider the substitution
 with savings towards durable goods.
 Further, the non-durable consumption considered in our analysis excludes
 the expenses on maintenance of owned assets.
 The educational expenses and other non-durable consumption thus form the
 budget constraint in the consumption.
 Since the selection of educational expense in a particular area of prosperity
 depends on the number of children and the age of the children - we consider
 the role that the household-age and the household-size (number of children)
 play in the education expense.
 The household characteristics such as religion and language spoken are
 also used as controls in the two economies.

 primary and higher-than primary educational levels).
 The agrarian/non-agrarian factor variable

The educational expenses and the non-asset related expenditures are obtained
 from the Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) which is conducted by
 the World Bank.
 The years used for the analyses are 2012-2014 for Tanzania and 2012-2015
 for Nigeria.
 While the data for consumption diaries are available also for 2010 in both
 Nigeria and Tanzania survey, we ignore the year 2010 due the value of assets

As described earlier, we interpret urbanisation as the asset concentration
 - and measure it simple as the log-averages of the values of durable goods
 (calculated as per the specifications in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ReferenceDefinitions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The durable goods owned by every consumer available in the surveys range
 from the short-term durable goods such as mobile phones to the expensive
 and long-term assets such as land or houses.
 Given our interest in the wealth that excludes consumption that is not
 inherited through, we focus on durable goodsthat can be transferred over
 a generation.
 For both Tanzania and Nigeria, we therefore included items as long-term
 assets only if they are costlier than furniture - which is the cheapest
 asset to be transferred between the generations in households.
 That the assets costlier than furniture are transferred over a generation
 is readily verified in the data by inspecting households that are split
 when a young member of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of durable goods in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the goods-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the durable goods owned by the household is thus obtained
 simply as a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$

At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us in
 the LSMS data for Tanzania.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts for the
 wider level consumer vicinity based on Euclidean distance.
 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the
 wards in year 2014 for Tanzania, we do not use the rural field for analysis
 at the wider-district level aggregation and use a variable indicating how
 rural the consumer's vicinity is by counting the number of rural wards
 in the 6

Of the two economies, a higher percent of the GDP comes from agricultural
 production in Tanzania.
 The per-capita GDP 2020 for Nigeria (2396.04 USD) is much higher than that
 of Tanzania (976.16 USD) (source World Bank).
 As of 2020, Nigeria had a population of 206.1 million and Tanzania's population
 was 59.7 million (source: World Bank).
 The GDP from manufacturing, mining and construction is nearly double for
 Nigeria (8749.61 million USD in 2022) compared to Tanzania (4221.41 million
 USD in 2021).
 Nigeria's GDP from agriculture is 9311.356608 and Tanzani'as 4313.46674 million
 USD.
 Some structural differences in the two economies could be attributed to
 higher reliance on energy exports in Nigeria - which, as of 2020, exports
 $35.9 billion crude and gas and top imports $7.75 buillion of refined Petroleum
 apart from cars ($3.03 billion), and wheat ($2 billion).
 On the other hand, Tanzania major exports are Gold and other minerals ($3
 billion) followed by agricultural products (0.594$ billion).
 The major imports of Tanzania are refined copper and petroleum ($2.2B).
 Among the two economies, Nigeria relies less on the agrarian exports and
 more on the energy-related infrastructure - resulting in higher average
 education levels in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HistEducationRanks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The role of private education is also much higher in Nigeria (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The urban residents spend much higher on education than the rural residents
 in both the economies.
 More specifically, urban residents spend 2.34 times more than rural residents
 in Nigeria whereas they spend 2.8 times more in Tanzania.
 The secondary education appears to get much costlier in Tanzania since
 the mean education expenditure for education rank 3 is almost double that
 of the expenditure on education rank 2 in Tanzania.
 In Nigeria, these costs rise by about 54%.
 The educational expenses do not seem to rise much with asset disparities
 in Nigeria - whereas they seem to be more unequally distributed in Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

Comparing the overall distribution of assets, we see that while the overall
 poverty may appear similar in Nigeria and Tanzania, the disparity in owned
 assets is far more extreme in Tanzania (particularly between the south
 of the country and the east - see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"

 for Nigeria and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for Tanzania).
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"

 less extreme in Nigeria (see Figure

 The inequality in expenditure on non-durable consumption - on the other
 hand - is not as different for the two economies.
 This can be verified with the Lorenz curves for total non-durable expenditure
 and total assets in Figure

 Since the range of occupations in the surveys from Tanzania and Nigeria
 is varied, the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria
 have been standardised into occupation ranks (ranging from 0 to 3) based
 on the data on income derived from the occupations in the survey.
 The reason why the income itself is not shown in the plots is that the
 data on income is far sparser than the recall of assets and reporting of
 occupations in the surveys from both the countries

 The primary reason for this is the sparsity of income data - a problem

To understand the urban-rural differences, we compare the fulfillment of
 basic needs in urban vs rural areas using the fraction of consumers that
 have run out of food in the last 12 months in every district across both

 Figures

 These indicate a significant number of households running out of food in
 urban areas (due to high costs) - even though the overall hunger instances
 remain proportionately lower in the urban areas (when compared to the household
s having run out of food due to agricultural reasons).
 The average consumer in the urban areas for both the economies - despite
 better options for lifestyle and consumption - seems to struggle with basic
 needs.
 The estimation in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 further explores if education expenses are significantly impacted by permanent
 income while quantifying the degree of urbanisation as concentration of
 long-term durable goods rather depending on the rural-urban indicator variable
 alone.

While we undertake a more detailed view on education expenses in the Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the key observation from the non-parametric view of the data is that the
 disparities in income and durable goods are more localised in Nigeria while
 they are more extreme across wider geographical regions in Tanzania.
 More specifically, despite the southern areas of Nigeria having more higher-pai
d occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure

Control Variables

Note that some of these controls are observed at the individual household
 level.
 One such variable is the logarithm of total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
logx
\family default
) - which is used as the control for permanent income in the estimation.
 The relationship between total household expenditures and the householdâ€™s
 permanent income is comes from standard consumption theory (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "modiglianiutility1954,FriedmanConsumption1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The controls such as the household's occupational and educational statuses
 are evidently observed at the household level.
 Similarly, the factor variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 (indicating whether the household head is employed in agriculture related
 occupation or not), the number of children in the household 
\begin_inset Formula $h$

\family default
), the mean age of the children in the household 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

 (

A goal of the empirical analysis is to find out if the educational expenses
 in the two economies rise more sharply as a result of higher prosperity
 consumer's locality (urbanisation level measured as concentration of long-term
 durable goods) rather the higher permanent income (measured as logarithm
 of total expenditure) and the education rank of the household.
 The empirical results also contrast the relative effects of wider and local
 income differences educational expenses in the two economies.

 suggest that an increase in 
\family typewriter

- causes a decrease in the the budget share on education 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 This may be largely due to the educational expenses forming a higher proportion
 of the total expenditure for poorer households - so we evaluate the 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$
\end_inset

 regressions (see Tables

 ) which suggest that the education expenditures rise with the increase
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $log(x)$
\end_inset

.
 The higher budget share of education is not solely due to higher urban
 prices in general - since the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ne}$
\end_inset

 remains weak on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{educ}$
\end_inset

 for both the economies (as urbanisation must also raises the prices of

The higher prosperity of districts (or urbanisation) increases educational

\begin_inset Formula $log(x_{educ})$

 drop with rising prosperity for Tanzania whereas they rise for Nigeria
 (see Tables

 This is true for other interpretations of the vicinity i.e.
 
\family typewriter
r_agri

\family typewriter
r_educ 
\family default
as well (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 for definitions).
 The more prosperous regions thus maintain higher expenditures on education
 in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite private education being more important in Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the access to private education is limited to the wealthier population
 in both the economies.
 As private education only accounts for a minority of the population (see
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BarChartSchoolTypes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), this seems to confirm the findings that higher education is not provided
 by private institutions in the region.
 The results also indicate a higher rise in secondary and tertiary education
 - if one looks at the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 i.e.

\family typewriter
 meanchildage
\family default
 (average age of the children) on education expenses in the two economies.
 The less surprising observation that more children increase the total expenditu
re is supported for both the economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note also that in Tanzania - with a higher disparity in asset-ownership
 and less urbanisation - the agrarian households seem to be spending higher
 on education (compare the coefficients of

) - esp considering the prosperity of households with the same educational-statu
s (
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 i.e.
 having higher than primary education or not).
 The education expenditure is thus higher for agrarian households in Tanzania
 after taking into account their poor educational status measured through

 Tanzania.

The role of social environment is strong in both the economies.
 The role of English language seems significant in Tanzania - where the
 English-speakers spend significantly higher on education.

\begin_layout Standard
We had set ourselves to understand how urbanisation levels may segregate
 education expenses (and thus future mobility) in two economies in the sub-Sahar
an Africa that differ in the level of urbanisation and income disparities.
 The results find significant effects of urbanisation levels - intepreted
 as concentration of durable goods - on education expenses in both the economies.
 The role of permanent income does seem weaker in Nigeria - where urbanisation
 is more likely to cause difference in education expense.
 In Tanzania, on the other hand, the role of permanent income is stronger.
 While private education seems more common in Nigeria, the state-provided
 education plays the dominant role in both the economies.
 It cannot be ruled out that higher urbanisation and the rise in incomes
 as well as education expenses with an expansion of education sector could
 allow private institutions to play a larger role in secondary education
 in either of the economies.

The results highlighting the significance of language and religion share
 the observations made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - who have highlighted the role of religious and colonial institutions
 in the educational mobility across sub-Saharan Africa.
 Further, as the agrarian consumers maintain a higher budget share on education
 expenses in the poorer economy (Tanzania) and higher education ranks consistent
ly correspond to higher education expenses in the more developed economy
 (Nigeria), it would appear that the educational expenses remain higher
 after attainment of education by the consumers and increase in regional
 prosperity.
 This seems aligned with the cohort-study from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "porzio2021human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who suggest that the labour with skills added through education is less
 willing to stay in agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In view of the structural differences in the two economies, the separation
 of opportunities for education and mobility in Tanzania seem strong with
 agrarian occupations lagging far behind relative to the urban areas.
 In Nigeria, on the other hand, the level of urbanisation and access to
 education are generally higher with the differences in education expenditure
 brought about through regional differences and religious institutions.
 There are thus two main conclusions we arrive at using the above results.
 First, the urbanisation - considering the two economies - does appear to
 be strongly associated with higher educational expenses.
 Second, while overall educational levels and expenses do rise with prosperity
 (as in Nigeria), the access to education as a means for mobility are likely
 to remain susceptible to social factors and long-term assets inequalities.
