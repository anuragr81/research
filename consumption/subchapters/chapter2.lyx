\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is derived based on the framework for intertempor
al consumption choice.
 Status is endogenised as states of financial stability and included as
 part of the consumer's utility in an intertemporal model for substitution
 between quality in non-durable consumption and savings for future assets.
 Theoretical and numerical solutions are discussed before estimation of
 the model for the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata over the years 2010,
 2012 and 2014.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a conventional analysis of demand, the prices and quantities observed
 for the items suggest the relative importance of commodities with respect
 to each other.
 The demand for individual goods is often aggregated into commodities to
 compare the demand with its past values or values in a different population
 - thus providing a sense of quality for a particular commodity.
 Evidently, a detailed set of market prices of the goods within every commodity
 would be required if we were to view status consumption as an instance
 of high-quality consumption and use the measures of quality from the demand
 literature to measure status-related consumption.
 As the data on market prices is seldom available at local levels in most
 consumer surveys - we often use a so-called hedonic approach - arguing
 that the characteristics of the commodity are what consumers evaluate in
 forms of price.
 While demand literature often uses market characteristics or shadow prices
 for such analyses of quality for a particular commodity, the studies on
 conspicuous consumption tend to explore a specific instance of status consumpti
on instead.
 Here, conspicuous consumption is expected to occur through goods of a particula
r (visible) type that are meant to be futile for the general needs of the
 consumer.
 This assumption allows us to use to the separability of demand for visible
 goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to extend the concept of visible consumption in the developing
 economies, we intend to use the framework of demand analysis without this
 assumption of separability - arguing that the more general framework could
 status consumption in a more varied context.
 While such a model might not benefit from the tractability that the models
 for visible consumption benefit from, the estimates of wealth of the consumer
 (e.g.
 asset ownership in consumer data), if available, may allow us to observe
 how quality across commodities is consumed with respect to the wealth of
 the consumer.
 A general sense of status consumption - as we argue - must come from a
 combination of higher quality across commodities and a stable ownership
 of wealth or assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To elaborate the model, we enhance the framework for intertemporal consumer
 choice by adding long-term incentives and near-term demand for quality.
 In what could be seen as an attempt to refine a permanent income approach
 (which vigorously ignores all non-monetary wealth), we relate the consumption
 on quality with the long-term wealth proxied with personal characteristics
 and asset ownership.
 Viewing owned assets (durable items) owned as an indicator of wealth also
 comes in handy as the data available on income is often poor in the economies
 with a significant informal sector.
 In the environment of long-established income and asset inequalities, the
 high quality commodities are seen as the consumer's attempt to improve
 her perceived status.
 Arguing that consumption is myopic and depends on the perception of status
 in a near-term while savings are cumulative in an intertemporal model for
 consumer choice, we let the representative consumer in the model optimise
 a utility inclusive of status - which is obtained both by owned assets
 (including skills and characteristics that are acquired over multiple generatio
ns) and the quality of consumption.
 
\bar under
Since the 
\bar default
signalling benefit a consumer derives from consumption, must come out of
 either high-priced non-durable consumption or long-term durable consumption,
 we view the signaling as the utility obtained from the consumption of quality
 and owned assets over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key variables that the econometric methods arising out of this intertemporal
 substitution approach are concerned with are i) the extent to which the
 consumers maintain their habits of purchasing quality ii) the extent to
 which they choose to save for future assets rather than to overspend on
 higher quality in the current time period (measured simply as the distance
 - in monetary terms - from the cost of basic needs) and lastly iii) a measure
 of the cost of basic needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consideration of the cost of assets available to the consumer is of particular
 interest if we wish to compare status-related consumption in two economies
 with disparate levels of economic development (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy).
 The distribution of assets - which may vary significantly in a developing
 economy from the distribution in a developed economy - provide us a way
 to compare the contexts of status consumption in the two economies.
 For a set of assets (long-term durable goods) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

 ordered by increasing cost, the difference in successive costs i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta d_{j}=d_{j}-d_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}\in\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}<d_{j}\forall(i<j)$
\end_inset

 may be much higher relative to the cost of quality consumption in one economy
 relative to that in the other.
 These may have disparate effects on consumer choice in the two economies
 as the costlier long-term assets may discourage savings for the future
 (the consumer may give up hopes of acquiring assets if she is to remain
 in a low income group relative to asset costs) and the perceptions of high
 mobility may encourage the consumer to overspend on quality in the short-term
 (matching one's consumption to one's perceived status).
 As assets have a more definite impact on the consumer's secure long-term
 growth (assets being a stronger indicator the stability of her income),
 in equilibrium, the consumer would balance the more uncertain perception
 of her status with the more certain expected value of savings in her lifetime.
 Thus if income is assumed to follow a process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer spending on her needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is known, then observing the proportion of consumer's spending on quality
 (which also determines the savings rate for durable goods in the intertemporal
 settings due to the total income constraint) with respect to the measures
 of wealth can help us comment on the contexts of status consumption in
 the two economies.
 This we believe is key to understanding status consumption across economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model we propose essentially compares the demand for long-term items
 vs that for demands short-term quality.
 Including assets and quality in a utility function, we consider the advantage
 from accumulated assets as well as that from the quality in the near term.
 Observing that a lot of non-durable consumption is related to the assets
 one owns, we also introduce a cost associated with owning assets in the
 intertemporal substitution framework.
 This explains how low income could create a trap of low-asset ownership
 for the consumers.
 In summary, we attempt to view status-related consumption in a conventional
 model for consumer demand - using the availability of asset costs in an
 economy and a definition of quality.
 We justify an interpretation of status consumption from quality and assets
 based on the assertion that for a rational consumer to spend on status
 consumption, she must see some status utility from consumption in the long-term
 or the short-term.
 To compare the status consumption in any two countries using our model,
 we seek econometric methods that measure the supply issues in the two economies
 and condition the demand on the macroeonomic differences in the two economies.
 Quality of consumption is measured as the distance of expensive nondurable
 consumption from the minimum cost of needs and any status value to the
 consumer in the short-run is assumed to be achieved through only the relative
 quality of consumption.
 The two primary goals we that our approach wishes to accomplish is i) to
 test whether the preference for quality increases with rise in income and
 urbanisation (indicated by the expansion of consumer basket) and ii) to
 see if preferences for quality change across populations segregated through
 levels of development, economic strata or social identities within an economy.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advancements of the last century in game theory and statistics have
 made us revisit many of Veblen's observations in more precise and quantitative
 terms - allowing us to interpret his early observations on the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour with a framework for decision under
 risk.
 An understanding of the effect that human behaviour and social conditions
 have on a macroscopic level may still be far from complete
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, but the framework for decision under risk is very pertinent to status-related
 consumption.
 There are two threads in the literature that we find promising in this
 regard.
 The first is that of habit formation amongst consumers and the second on
 the relevance of social identities in visible consumption.
 We believe that a framework of decision under risk should allow us to link
 the two threads in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature from behavioural economics, marketing research and development
 economics all seem to concur on the tendencies of habit formation in consumer
 behaviour.
 The measurement of changes in habits and quality has a long tradition in
 neoclassical economics (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment of the problem).
 Of particular interest is the model for myopia amongst consumers described
 by Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who notes the significance of lagged consumption on aggregate consumption.
 The life-cycle model used by Muellbauer has been of considerable importance
 in more recent studies on consumption where a rational utility-optimising
 consumer balances between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned savings over her life-time i.e.
 in an intertemporal substitution setting (a problem often treated equivalent
 to the classical utility maximising consumption problem).
 Improving upon the classical approach where the consumer is subservient
 to her optimised plan for life-time savings and consumption, a few behavioural
 approaches (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for example) have sought descriptive models for mental accounting and factors
 such as willpower to better understand the development of habits in consumers.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice, the
 representative consumer in such models is subject to overeating, overspending,
 accumulating items she doesn't need or acquiring habits she cannot afford.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thread of literature on consumption that is more empirical in nature
 has observed how social identities play a role in status-signalling.
 Empirical studies in both the developed world and the developing countries
 find social group identities relevant to status-related consumption (see

 We belive that viewing status consumption with the intertemporal substitution
 framework could help connect the two threads in the literature.

 to move herself up in the ranking order.
 With a framework of social ranking and signaling therewith, Robert Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for example, finds that signaling needs become more important amongst the
 lower economic strata when they are huddled in the overpopulated suburban
 areas of big cities in the US.
 Inspecting similar behaviours in South Africa (see Kaus

 present evidence that the conspicuous consumption for consumers in S Africa
 is relative to lower or similar income-groups (rather than relative to
 higher income groups) .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the instances of status consumption under several cultural contexts
 seem to have a common theme of expenditure on signaling items - there may
 be a need to tread with caution when looking at demand of items in the
 developing countries that are considered conspicuous in the developed countries.
 This is because the relative wealth differences may be more relevant for
 status differences in the developing countries.
 The wealth differences being much larger and the industrial development
 much more concentrated in a developing country, the glaringly visible and
 sufficiently local (dense) wealth differences may have far more weight
 than the limited range of status items that a rational consumer may purchase
 (see Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for criticism of a 
\shape italic
belle epoque 
\shape default
view of status consumption).
 On the other hand, rapid industrialisation and a transformation of consumer
 markets in many developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as Asia
 may imply a narrowing the income differences in the consumption and expansion
 of the industrial sector.
 These may make the consumption of status-related items significant enough
 to make Veblen's ostensibly dated insights on status relevant in the context
 of the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sociological studies have long indicated the role that industrial goods
 and income rises play in addressing of status needs by the consumers (see
 Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SrinivasSanskritization"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 , Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 ).
 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SrinivasSanskritization"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 noted an instance of Veblen's pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "true"

\end_inset

 (referred to as 
\shape italic
Sanskritization
\shape default
) as the erstwhile lower classes emulated the habits of higher social classes
 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, the habits of the upper economic classes were similarly
 observed to have expanded to the middle and lower classes in the decades
 after the second world war.
 In the post-feudal societies all over the world where consumer markets
 have developed, a new working class seems to have replaced the feudal or
 colonial order of the century before - attempting to emulate the former's
 behaviour.
 Still, while this setting is not unrelated to the one that Veblen had described
 in his treatise on conscpicuous consumption, there are many ways in which
 the context of the sub-Saharan African context is different from the American
 gilded age.
 One may find therefore that the status consumption in the developing countries
 in large part is merely an indication of wealth (see Khamis et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The questions in the consumer survey (which is how a researcher may obtain
 the list of visible items) may need to be adjusted to include items that
 may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A model of the particular conditions of the post-war developments that would
 consider the much higher levels of industrialisation and population growth
 since the last century - is probably key to understanding how the consumption
 is fundamentally different in our times.
 A model reflecting such conditions that has been of significant interest
 in the development economics literature is the Harris Todaro model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GollinLRF,HarrisTodaro1970"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 - which focuses on the urban and rural interactions in the developing countries
 while relating income differences with the consumer's uncertainty.
 The represenative consumer in the model (a worker/farmer) is meant to maximise
 her income and reduce the risk associated with it as she is faced with
 the choice of migration to the urban areas.
 To include relative income and wealth concerns in order to incorporate
 status-related consumption, one could enhance the model by refining the
 migration incentives to include goals of consumption quality and peer effects.
 A flight to urban areas - after all - may not be merely an escape from
 despondent circumstances but also serve as an entry to the expanded urban
 consumption basket and a (perceived) promise of social mobility - incentives
 that are of importance in any group behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peer effects for consumption have also been considered in the developing
 economics literature.
 One example is the Indian food budget squeeze (where per capita calorie
 intake seems to have declined as per capita income has increased) - which
 Sen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sen2005Calories,DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 attributes to the rise in the poverty-level for consumption of non-food
 items.
 More recently, Chai et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 have used a peer-effects approach to inspect the consumption on signaling
 items.
 In Sen view or in a general model considering long-term choices (e.g.
 migration, ownership of a house etc.) with the relative consumption of quality,
 a reference point separating basic needs from luxury or high-quality consumptio
n becomes a necessity.
 For much of the developing economics literature, this encompasses the discussio
n of poverty levels.
 In the developed economies where income inequalities are less of a concern
 and data on income is generally more reliable, it is relatively easier
 to separate the bare necessities from the luxuries to identify status consumpti
on.
 Focusing on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption in the regions of erstwhile East and West Germany after the
 economic liberalisation at the end of cold war, for example, Friehe et
 al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrieheGermany"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 have explored if prolonged measures of income equality can influence conspicuou
s consumption asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes.
 To develop a model with the effects of income and wealth differences in
 a more general setting however (e.g.
 that of a developing economy), one needs a clear definition of what constitutes
 the needs of the consumer and her consumption for status.
 Without a clear separation between needs and quality (or luxury) that is
 also general enough to be used across cultural contexts, the macroeconomic
 factors, issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) may appear so intertwined
 with the needs of the consumer that a robust measure of status consumption
 can never be justified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the literature we have surveyed, the methods to standardise the macroeconomic
s inputs (welfare, growth, savings rate) and human needs have appeared far
 more rigorous than a definition of status-related consumption that is also
 general enough to be applied across various cultural contexts.
 The conspicuous consumption studies appear to make varied assumptions about
 what to include as part of conspicuous consumption and what not to.
 Some studies, for example, include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in the status-related items while others don't.
 In some cases, studies employ a consumer basket identified from a different
 economy on the basis of items being of conspicuous value by common knowledge.
 Except when a survey is used to identify 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption, the contents of the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 tend to have items that are just commonly understood to have some signaling
 value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visibility surveys (see Heffetz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) often provide the means to get around the problem of the dependence of
 classification of status items on a particular cultural context.
 The survey approach to classification of status items also lends itself
 to tractable models (e.g.
 those provided by Ireland 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, Hopkins-Kornienko 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 With an assumption that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the
 regular sense - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for
 visible consumption may be considered separable (additively) from the utility
 for non-visible consumption (we refer to this assumption as the futility
 assumption henceworth) .
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 Despite this much desirable tractability of visible consumption (see Ireland

\end_inset

, Hopkins-Kornienko 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HopkinsKornienkoStatusGames2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

), we favour the an approach where snob and bandwagon behaviour form the
 fundamental mechanisms for status consumption.
 The latter approach allows us to include wealth differences and the quality
 in an intertemporal setting - which we find more general for the varied
 contexts of the developing world 
\begin_inset Foot

The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor
 that they belong to a club that poor don't (invidious comparison).
 We have found Corneo's terminology more tractable for empirical analyses

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A certain ontological sense of status can be associated with the consumer's
 long-term security from the extreme fluctuations of in her wealth.
 This ontological sense of status i.e.
 the consumer's long-term stability of income is aligned with how status
 is measured in the literature from health and sociological sciences - which
 often track status with a vector of income, education and occupation (see
 Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 In the short-term however, the multitude of risks perceived by the consumer
 encompass the sense of status.
 This is the sense that is influenced with short-term consumption.
 Treating assets accumulated as an indicator of long-term wealth different
 from income, we use the intertemporal substitution to understand how the
 consumers may balance consumption in quality in the present with the savings
 for future assets.
 Thus, in addition to the dispersion in income amongst social classes (gauged
 with a simple variance in past income), we also consider the dispersion
 in quality and wealth owing to long-established hierarchies.
 This we believe is relevant to understanding the influence that wealth
 yields towards status in the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirically, the long-term assets which are considered part of the consumer
 wealth are those that can be passed on to generations while the short-term
 concerns of the consumer (which are themselves influenced by the acquired
 wealth) comprise only of needs and quality.
 If there is any status related utility to be derived from non-durable consumpti
on, it would be constituted in the felicity from quality (which is defined
 as distance from needs).
 This is because the consumer with a habit of high-quality in consumption
 (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfilment of consumer needs itself however carries no such influence
 on status.
 Similarly, any status that is not signaled with non-durable consumption
 i.e.
 quality must come out of long-term assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the utility to the consumer under the intertemporal setting where
 she balances the two competing tendencies also considers the peer effects
 which she faces.
 The utility function quantifies the advantage a consumer receives by deviating
 from the the average values of the particular status determinants (i.e.
 quality and asset ownership) pertaining to the consumer's immediate surrounding
s (with respect to a locality, a relevant social group, income or asset-owner
 group etc.).

Quality differences may exist amongst the long-term assets as well.
 However, if assets are sparingly available in the consumer population,
 it may be suffice to consider the difference between having an asset and
 not having the asset.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If for example, the individuals with high asset ownership live in a region
 different than where those with low asset ownership reside, the consumer
 is not expected see so much benefit from consumption of quality.
 The consumption of quality would thus be segregated based on asset ownership
 or characteristics associated with long-term asset ownership (e.g.
 region, social identity etc.).
 Since the social interaction between groups segregated based on assets
 is minimised, this imposes a constraint on the movement of consumption
 quality away from assets (see the discussion of cost associated with asset
 ownership for a further discussion on covement of quality and asset ownership).

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
While the models 
\bar default
for visible consumption can also be extended to incorporate the peer effects,
 we find that an approach that endogenises wealth and assets directly is
 more general for the developing world context.
 So instead of using a framework for demand with a certain items that are
 known a priori to have a status carrying potential, we use a model which
 marks a substitution between the accumulation of long-term assets or characteri
stics and the short-term relative quality.
 By means of an analogy, consider a market for cars where status is signalled
 through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption means that the consumers pay more
 attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint, rims
 etc.
 - which definitely futile) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality
 of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would also want to see i) the price differences in
 the cars being sold in the market and ii) the constraints on occupation
 and income that exist in the respective areas.
 In the context of status consumption, while it may be true that individuals
 spend more on their outward appearances and visible goods (despite controlling
 for everything else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not
 all what status consumption over time may comprise of (see the Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and Eastman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for varied terminology around status consumption).
 Not all high quality consumption is visible.
 In particular, some higher quality non-durable consumption (such as using
 electricity in a developing country) may not be visible in nature but must
 accompany higher durable consumption that may in turn be visible (electrical
 equipment etc.).
 Similarly, while a visible item is effectively a high-quality item (since
 visibility is priced in the market), not all visible consumption may qualify
 as high quality consumption either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is straightforward to include visible consumption in our framework if
 it is viewed in relation to the ownership of assets or long-term wealth.
 If the consumer preferences for needs across different commodity groups
 and the assets she acquires are considered, visibility through non-durable
 consumption (i.e.
 visible consumption) can be seeb as a preference order for quality across
 the groups.
 More particularly, as prices of commodities change or new goods are introduced,
 the consumer may adjust her quality of non-durable consumption (once her
 needs are met) based on a preference order over the commodity groups.
 For example, a consumer may consider quality for transport more important
 than quality in food (or vice versa).
 One could say that the commodities such as food are less visible than household
 or entertainment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term needs does
 not view status consumption as futile but relates it with an expectation
 of social mobility - which the consumer considers after fulfilment of basic
 needs and which is influenced both with long-term possessions and non-durable
 consumption.
 The relevance of a social-identity to status is viewed in terms of an expectati
on of high status through a history of past asset ownership, incomes/occupations
 (a criterion that makes the consumer raise her expectations through association
 with the identity).

Status as utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A property of utility function from where much of the model could follow
 is that status is constituted in the consumer's long-term utility.
 If not, the model's representative consumer would have no reason to engage
 in status-related consumption in any form.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a
 consumer can a achieve higher status in the model not only by the acquisition
 of assets (which is assisted with higher income) but also by the status
 promotion through consummption (which may enhanced social interactions
 and improve self-image).
 The role of non-durable consumption is therefore two-fold in the model
 - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer and second, it
 also matches the high-quality consumption with status related goals.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity in
 the present as well as a possible status advantage - since all else being
 the same, someone consuming a higher quality is likely to have more status
 than someone consuming a lower quantity.

 We also argue that assets themselves would cause of this

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth clarifying that by tracking the consumer's deviation from her
 needs and matching consumption of quality with the consumer's utility for
 status, we do not intend to make any descriptive claims about the consumer's
 belief.
 Since consumption is myopic while savings are cumulative, the association
 of a felicity from quality is only a way to differentiate the more certain
 indicators of status from those that contribute to the deviation from fulfillme
nt of basic needs in the short-term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also worth emphasising that conspicuous consumption should not appear
 trivialised when viewed as mere higher-quality consumption.
 We find that a lot of appeal for conspicuous consumption in the public
 discourse is formed due to it being presented as a phenomenon that only-serves-
the-rich.
 Even though a conspicuous item is seen as an item that is used both to
 distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself, there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst
 the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 A view that considers conspicuous consumption a way to distinguish oneself
 from one's own reference group and the reference wealth level through consumpti
on would need to admit a more general definition of status consumption that
 considers the effect of the distance from fulfilment of basic needs on
 the the consumer's signaling.
 If we can agree that the signaling behaviour can be exhibited by everyone
 and cause a direct improvement of the consumer's perceived status, then
 an increase in her consumption corresponding to her perceived status is
 justified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason to object to the view of status consumption as a consumption
 exclusive to the rich is that the utility to the rich from status consumption
 might be quite little given that the rich consumer already has enough to
 distance herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have
 anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave
 anyone behind).
 We argue instead that even the poorest may want to indicate that they are
 not the poorest - much the way the richest may want it to be known to the
 others that they are indeed the richest

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 is needed for everybody - as everyone in the middle (those who are neither
 the richest nor the poorest) must also try to avoid getting poorer and
 try to become the richest at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fundamental way in which our model differs from those of visible consumption
 is that there is a private utility to be derived from status consumption
 in the model.
 This warrants some clarification as many empirical studies have viewed
 visible consumption as a kind that provides only public utility (and no
 private utility).
 In the view that motivates our model, a luxury watch may be futile for
 private use by itself (when compared to its cheaper alternatives with same
 functionality), but if an aspiring businessman uses his knowledge of luxury
 watches to find new clients for her business, then the futile consumption
 can translate into a material advantage.
 The perception of status - however unrealistic - can influence one's wealth
 if everyone in one's reference group also acts in accordance to the perception.
 It may be apt to consider conspicuous consumption futile but only in a
 sense that is different from what a modeler would be concerned with.
 Items like luxury watches are important only because the rich flock around
 them.
 Thus if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
 However, the peer effects that conspicuous items accompany is important
 as it acts as a means of connecting the rich with the not-so rich.
 In the example of luxury watches, indeed only a few of the purchasers of
 luxury watches would improve their self-image - enhancing their social
 networks - while others may remain mere purchasers.
 What matters is that a certain number of buyers of luxury watches actually
 achieve success over the long term and influence the peers in their reference
 group whose members can observe the success.
 As explained before, we are not concerned with how many of the businessmen
 actually believe that conspicuous consumption would help them (i.e.
 we do not attempt to describe their beliefs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the operationalisation of the model, the long-term assets and the income
 process provide the environment where the consumer's non-durable consumption
 is observed.
 Here, the items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 are considered long-term assets while those that cannot be passed are considere
d short-term.

Needs, wealth and consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having argued that both quality and ownership of long-term assets contribute
 to the consumer's long-term status, we now turn to how a consumer may achieve
 both in the context of needs and prices.
 Our view of non-durable status-related consumption is essentially that
 of non-necessary consumption - and thus empirically, it must rely on a
 sound definition of needs - which provide the reference point for quality
 in the model.
 That there must be the idea of universal needs may itself be a contentious
 issue.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs can supersede
 her subjective interests (wants).
 We lean towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need
 of the consumer without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts should be standardised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an empirical analysis, health and autonomy are fairly abstract ideas
 when the context of consumption is not limited to food and employment.
 When considering quality in food, for example, this is a relatively easier
 task as we may just consider the cost of the cheapest option for proteins,
 carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area.
 For contexts other than food, however, what constitutes basic needs is
 less trivial.
 For example, what constitutes a basic house or a basic set of furniture
 would require some justification based on a cultural or geographic context.
 Standardising needs in terms of the quantity of non-durable consumption
 poses another issue - since the non-durable consumption may depend on the
 long-term assets that the consumer possesses.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and thus a high non-durable consumption
 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical assets would not have
 the respective non-durable consumption).
 To get around the issue, we therefore consider needs associated with a
 certain asset level.
 Once the level of needs in a population of consumers is established, the
 cost of needs of the consumer are driven the local price of the needs and
 a certain personal characteristics (e.g.
 residence in an expensive region) as well as the assets one possesses.
 This is discussed in more detail in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ModelDynamics"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that status is not considered a need using this
 approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the asset
 level she achieves while the her basic needs are independent of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both assets
 and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and income of the
 consumer (rather than high-class or low-class needs of the consumer).
 As an example, the difference between the status of a rich and that of
 a poor family in our model is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 the family combined with a demand for quality for education (with a higher
 price for higher quality).
 It may thus be possible to proxy the needs of the family simply by number
 of members in the family (adjusted by their age).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference point of needs is crucial to our view of quality as it is
 simply a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 If the quality of consumption or excess calculated in such a manner is
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\Psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of assets owned 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Since consumption changes with the perceptions of wealth, the dependence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\rho$
\end_inset

 can give more structure to the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon$
\end_inset

.
 For example, while a consumer may want to improve quality instead of saving
 for an asset, the quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may not be improved beyond a certain point until more assets are purchased.
 For example, in the household category, high prices of housing may encourage
 the consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus improve 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) but she may improve the quality instead of buying a bigger house only
 until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 Here, the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 moves together with assets that the consumer acquires.
 In other words, there are clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 that are associated with a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We discussion the modeling of peer effect in a later section but the dependence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\nu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 also has implications on the additivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\Psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

.
 The limited substitution between assets and non-durable consumption allows
 us to express the utility function as 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon=f(A)+g(\Psi)+m(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 As the consumer matches her consumption with her status goals and a certain
 high quality non-durable consumption is available only when associated
 with a corresponding asset or a long-term characteristic (such as education,
 housing, identity, region owing to segregation, trade barriers etc.), higher
 quality choices would accompany higher-quality assets.
 The substitution between low-quality asset and high-quality non-durable
 consumption being limited due to co-movement of expensive non-durable consumpti
on with expensive asset ownership also means that the quality differences
 in the assets can be ignored.
 A high-quality asset is thus merely a more expensive asset in the utility
 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(A,\rho,\nu)$
\end_inset

 in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider how price derivatives may enter the utility and consumer
 decision.
 Without price changes, the consumption of quality would change only when
 individuals acquire long-term durable goods or give up hopes of acquiring
 costlier assets (possibly due to other needs).
 As the consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality, a rise in
 quality must come either from an increase in income or from an undercut
 in savings.
 Similarly, if needs stay the same, a drop in quality must be due to purchase
 of assets or a drop in income.
 Empirically, the prices are attached with a commodity rather than overall
 quality.
 So, to consider price changes, one must consider the price of needs as
 well as the price of quality across the various commodities.
 Faced with change in prices, a consumer may prefer quality in one commodity
 over another (i.e.
 a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport to food or
 vice versa) as she addresses her needs and long-term assets requirements.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider a middle-income family that
 moves to a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants
 are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place.
 One way to view this change in the consumer's circumstances is to observe
 that the price of entertainment services are lower for the consumer in
 the new neighborhoods.
 Assuming the needs of the family (indicated by the number of family members)
 haven't changed, the consumption would either shift to saving for a better
 car or improve quality in some other category (better jewelry, better schooling
 for kids etc.) in response to price changes or a equivalent changes in income.
 The sensitivity of consumption with respect to price thus comprises of
 sensitivity with respect to basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\Psi_{t}}$
\end_inset

as well as a sensitivity with respect to quality for each commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\nu_{t}}$
\end_inset

.

Model Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the properties of the utility function discussed so far, we now discuss
 how the observed variables which the consumer evaluates to exercise her
 choice of quality that is turn measured as the distance from cost of basic
 needs.
 These observed variables are the i) needs of the consumer ii) her income
 and iii) the assets she owns.
 To measure the quality chosen by the consumer, we observe the consumption
 within certain categories (which for in the current chapter are food, energy,
 transport and household).
 These variables are then assimilated in the Euler equations of the intertempora
l substitution problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The additive form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\Psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 means that there is a substitution between quality and assets.
 A consumer could achieve the same utility - inclusive of status - as that
 of a consumer with with higher education or higher asset ownership by raising
 her high-quality consumption.
 Similarly, the asset-owners need not purchase quality to stay ahead of
 others.
 Empirically, however, we note that high quality in non-durable often is
 constrained by asset ownership.
 Those who own a refrigerator spend less on kerosene for their energy needs
 compared to those who don't own a refrigerator.
 If we measure quality as the distance from cost of needs, there is a sunken
 cost the refrigerator owner incurs due to her asset ownership.
 If we wish to view quality after having conditioned for such costs in order
 to avoid double-counting the advantage the asset owner has, we ought to
 separate the quality demanded by the consumer from that which is incurred
 due to asset ownership.
 To ask whether the refrigerator owners spend more on exotic fruits than
 those those who don't, we must separate the running costs of the refrigerator
 from the measurement of quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Two measures address this standardisation of demand - first is the classificati
on of quality in separable commodities e.g.
 food, energy so that we may compare demand for quality in food with that
 for quality in household goods or transport.
 The second is the introduction of a cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 - which accounts for the cost of maintaining assets or similar characteristics
 (such as education or social class) 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is possible that ownership of some assets generates some rental income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, we would prefer to treat such income as an additional stream of income
 instead treating it as negative costs in the model.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This takes care of the peer-effects to some extent - giving more weight
 to quality consumed by non-asset owners than would be if we didn't include
 the cost of assets.

Needs of the consumer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have briefly discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:nonstochproblem"

\end_inset

, our notion of quality is dependent on what we consider as needs rather
 than the characteristics of items (see Rosen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenImplicitHedonic1974"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a summary of hedonic approaches).
 We define needs as the standard requirements not meeting which would lead
 to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory argued for by Doyal
 and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, the counter-argument
 would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the consumer incurred
 by not having other nutrients is definite - thus ruling out a starch diet
 fulfilling the set of dietary needs.
 However, such a theory of needs is a normative concern (rather than descriptive
) - as a consumer may not always want her needs.
 Such a model for needs cannot represent a situation where consumers forgo
 a certain need to compromise on their health or autonomy in favour of some
 other wants.
 This makes the task to ensure that the needs are indeed just a minimum
 necessary set for health and autonomy to the individual extremely important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the minimum requirements for commodities such as food, clothing,
 housing and employment and calculate the costs associated with them in
 the local context (at a district level in the Tanzanian data - for example).
 The cost of the basic requirements per head 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 thus calculated are then multiplied with the number of family members 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

 to obtain the cost of needs of the household (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}\cdot\eta_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Relying only on total costs associated with a commodity (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality cannot differentia
te between the consumption of a higher quantity and of a higher quality.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 for a commodity priced 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$
\end_inset

, then our quality metric for the consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

).
 However, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity are
 available in the region or not, it may be possible to draw conclusions
 about over-consumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity.
 This is particularly so when using pseudo-panel analyses for the data.

\begin_layout Standard
Whether we model the needs of the household as a unit that lives forever
 (dynasty) or as a household individual with a finite lifetime 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

 period must be aligned with the population trends in the economy.
 In the particular context of a developing country, we find that the expected
 path of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t,T)$
\end_inset

 is influenced with a high population growth rate and prevalence of a joint-fami

 maintain two uncertainties - the first being in how her annual income unfolds
 in her future years and the second before how she becomes part of a stable
 high-consumption club through means other than income growth.

Empirically, this means that while the exogenous income process may depend
 on education or occupation levels, the effect that long-term characteristics
 have on consumption are not necessarily through income but through constraints
 or the stability that the long-term characteristics and expectations may
 bring.
 As the effects of on consumption are modeled explicitly, it would suffice
 if the income process models an expectation of the monetary growth alone
 i.e.
 a reflection of the steady growth in the economy on to the consumer's budget.
 For the analysis of the Tanzanian data therefore, we have assumed an income
 process with a steady rate of growth 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 every year i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}=i_{0}k^{t}$

\end_inset

 is the starting income, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the time period and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the rate of growth per period.
 Here, the past values of 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$

Change in asset ownership over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wealth of a consumer is represented in the model with a combination
 of accumulated assets and long-term characteristics (education, occupation
 or social identity).
 The asset ownership is modeled with an asset account - whose value is reflected
 in the total cost of assets inclusive of cash assets that the consumer
 owns.
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase assets and the actual purchase
 of assets.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all assets in
 the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success to preferences
 being the same for everybody) that provides furniture, housing and all
 amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every asset and service - offered as a life-long subscription - can be
 purchased by giving an amount to this company.
 We also assume that at the of the lifetime of a consumer, her personal
 wealth would either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so
 that the asset account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth
 of someone else in the economy.
 Consequently, while all individuals in the population are assumed to be
 the same as our representative consumer in terms of the preferences for
 needs over quality, they differ in the the starting amount of their asset
 accounts as well as the trends of their salaries, the trajectory of their
 needs and their long-term quality habits.
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and a steady growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, she would after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working her salary is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}k^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the total income she has earned is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{\tau}i_{j}=\frac{i_{0}k}{k-1}(k^{\tau}-1)$
\end_inset

.
 At a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased assets from a portion of her income and decided
 that she does not want more assets for the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, her life circumstances might have changed (she may need
 a bigger house or want a more expensive house) thus needing more assets
 urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

For simplicity, we also assume an environment of zero interest and one where

 Also, due to the minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing
 countries, we assume a negligible credit in the market.
 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only asset available in the market.

 and observed consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 that are observed in the data, we now turn to a quality control in the
 Euler equations of the intertemporal setting that represents the consumer
 choice for quality.
 By definition of the needs, a consumer is meant to select a quality control
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 only after her needs

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is due to the assumption that the personal characteristics don't change
 in the near-term analysis).
 Thus we view the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) as a multiplier of the cost of needs - the higher its value the higher
 would be the distance from the basic needs consumption (and lower would

 Other than the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 consumer (which are encapsulated by the asset

The non-durable costs imposed by the assets one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.) imply either that avoiding the respective expenses is
 not an option for the consumer owning some assets or that some certain
 long-term choices or characteristics (e.g.
 not having a house or living in a region that doesn't have electricity
 available) would limit the choice to avail quality through non-durable
 consumption.
 For example, a homeowner is required to maintain her own house the way
 someone who doesn't own the house has to pay the rent.
 As some costs are incurred due to the assets that the consumer acquires,
 a distance from the basic needs (which are themselves imposed only by health
 and autonomy requirements) could be introduced as the consumer acquires
 more assets.
 Such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

enhanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 needs of the consumer as she acquires assets necessitate a parameter in
 the model that is different from the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 and separates how much the consumer choice is related to her long-term
 standing influenced by 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 from how much quality is demanded in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 This former constraint is provided with the cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 - which along with the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 selected by the consumer contributes to the consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 thus adjusts the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 with the costs incurred due to asset ownership (e.g.
 of maintenance fees or rent in the housing example).
 The Euler equations for this model are as follows:

 The cost

 her personal characteristics and owned assets.
 For example, the costs of housing that contribute to

 may consist of the mortgage fee or maintenance fees when someone owns a
 house but a monthly rent when the consumer does not own a house.

Instead of formulating a dynamic optimisation problem, one may solve a non-stoch
astic intertemporal problem by drawing an equivalence between total wealth
 and the total outlay (in the classical consumer choice problem ) before
 employing similar econometric methods.
 Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\beta ln(x)+\gamma ln(p)+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 commonly used in estimation is effectively derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x\Rightarrow log(w_{i})=log(p_{i})+log(g(x,p))-log(x)$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,p)$
\end_inset

 as the Marshallian demand function, using the double-logarithmic model
 (which is a mere restatement of existence of elasticities through total
 differentiation) yields 
\begin_inset Formula $log(g(x,p))=\alpha_{i}+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}log(x)+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p)}log(p)$

\begin_inset Formula $log(w_{i})=\alpha_{i}+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}-1)log(x)+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{i})}+1)log(p_{i})+\sum_{j\ne i}\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{j})}log(p_{j})$

 Since the adding up restriction is more difficult to impose on this form

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 An estimation of demand elasticities of consumption can be performed with

 In this equivalent formulation, the constraint for the consumer can be
 stated as the total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\delta_{i}(A_{T}+\sum c_{i})$

Needs are related to consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 through their cost in the particular locality where the household is located.
 Given the categories of consumption in Tanzania i.e.
 food, household, energy and transport, we calculate the cost of basic needs
 as the cost a minimal requirements in every category.
 As an example, we use the commodity sub-groups of carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables in the food category.
 The cost of this minimal basket - which is composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - are then calculated in each region and district based
 on the prices of the items recorded in the survey (which records the prices
 at the district level as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket could be a
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - as these are most often
 the cheapest items in their respective sub-group (
\begin_inset Formula ${carb,fact,protein,fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the cost of this basket thus calculated is much higher
 in the urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) when available.
 For household, the cost of the minimal house in the locality (amortised
 over the average working life) and the cost of clothing per year is used.
 For transport, we use public-transport costs and petrol consumption costs
 depending on where the consume resides and whether the consumer owns a
 car or not.

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the income process, we use the reported income from primary
 occupations in the Tanzania LSMS data over the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 One limitation of the Tanzanian LSMS data is that it does not provide income
 data for every household head for which the consumption diary and assets
 are recorded.
 Another limitation of the data set is that a household that is visited
 in a particular year is less likely to be visited after more than 2 years.
 This means that while a significant number households would be common between
 2010 and 2012 as well as between 2012 and 2014, very few households that
 were visited in 2010 would be visited the third time in 2014 (in fact less
 than 100 household from the survey in 2010 seem to be visited in 2014 for
 income survey).
 Such a lack of a true panel data compels us to prepare a pseudo-panel for
 the calibration of the income process.
 The pseudo-panel we prepare is based on the similarity of the number of
 adults, the number of children, the year of birth of the adults, the occupation
 and education levels

A minor issue encountered while the preparation of the pseudo-panel related
 to the age of the household members was circumvented with an approximate
 matching of that year-of-birth values.
 The LSMS community survey appears to have recorded the year-of-birth values
 for individuals in years 2010 and 2012 but the age variable is recorded
 instead for the year 2014.
 Matching the year-of-birth values from 2012 with the YOB values inferred
 from the recorded age was made possible by allowing a tolerance for matching
 the YOB values for the preparation of the pseudo-panel.

 Since the Hausman tests point to the inconsistency of the RE Gestimator
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 , we use a FE GLS estimator for the pseudo-panel.
 That said, we do favour the use of RE estimator when the effect of time-invaria

To understand how the function

 may be fitted with empirical data, consider a set of items say 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0},I_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

 over which the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 is selected by the consumer.
 The items 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0},I_{1}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{3}$
\end_inset

 have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0},p_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}<p_{1}<p_{2}$
\end_inset

 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the item with the lowest available quality (hence the minimum price
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

).
 Assuming that the quantity needed for minimum needs per head is 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, two consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$

\begin_inset Formula $(q_{10}q_{11})$

 is quantity consumed of item 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

\begin_inset Formula $i$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\nu_{1}p_{0}=\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{1k}$

\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}\nu_{2}=\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{2k}$

 The value of the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{i\in[1,2]}$
\end_inset

 represents merely the distance from the fulfillment of the basic needs
 i.e.
 the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}$
\end_inset

 and represents the consumer preference for quality within a certain commodity.

The form of

\end_inset

 in Equation

 Consider a consumer facing only the prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

, so that all items other than the item 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$

 The likely effect of having just the quantity consumed as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{10}$
\end_inset

 is thus be to reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=0}^{2}p_{k}q_{1k}=p_{0}q_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}<p_{1}<p_{2}$

 still applies.

 The effect of having constraints on quality due to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is thus equivalent to addition or removal of items from the consumer basket.
 If a rural consumer who has access to only some of the items from the urban
 basket (which an urban consumer has access to), the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 she chooses is equivalent to removing some items from the urban consumer's
 basket.
 Thus the function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can also be seen as a filter on the set of prices of a basket of all items
 (i.e.
 items available at a national level or at the respective top level of granulari
ty in an empirical) that returns the costs pertinent to owned asset level
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Equivalently, when the consumer acquires more assets, her basket effectively
 expands as she is forced to be away from basic needs consumption cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{0}$

Potentially, the effects of regional variation in the basket (more items
 within a commodity) on the varied consumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can also be accommodated with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 by treating the additional expenditure on quality in an expensive region
 - where the basket is more varied - as a cost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While this approach hasn't been followed in our empirical analyses, the
 filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 can be used to standardise the supply conditions in a more general analysis
 - e.g.
 in a comparison of demand between two disparate economies.
 For example, in the more developed market, one expects to see rental options,
 availability of cheaper substitutes or extension of credit facilities to
 the consumer for an durable good that is too expensive for her.
 This contrast in the supply conditions would have two effects on the consumer
 demand.
 First, the difference between successive asset costs in an order of assets
 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{i}=A_{i}-A_{i-1}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula ${A_{i}}={A_{1}<A_{2}<A_{3}}$
\end_inset

) would be lower in the more developed market because the market would make
 cheaper alternatives available to the consumer.
 Second, a lot of assets can be availed without ownership in the developed
 market.
 To consider a particular example of car ownership, we would see both that
 the cars can be enjoyed with a frequent non-durable cost (rental) rather
 than through ownership and that the cars are available in a wider range
 of costs in the developed market.
 Standardsing the supply conditions in the two economies with 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 would imply a less discrete distribution of assets in the developed market
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) so that the same level of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 may correspond to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho$
\end_inset

) in the developed market.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

, one may use either the form involving 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ModelDynamics"

\end_inset

 or plugin the costs associated with assets that are observed in the consumption
 diary directly as the output of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

.
 A sound definition of long-term assets and an appropriate form of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 is necessary - as both the approaches are susceptible to measurement errors
 associated with the ownership and inter-generational transfer of assets.
 Empirically, we determine a long-term asset for the particular household
 as any good that has an expected lifetime long enough to be passed on to
 the owner's progeny.
 Recall that based on the arguments in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:LiteratureReview"

\end_inset

, a good that can't be passed on isn't long-term for the purposes of the
 current model and would not cause any observable change in the expected
 social mobility.
 Such consumption (inclusive of any status consumption through quality)
 is considered non-durable for our purposes and would not serve as an input
 to the process 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 - which returns only maintenance fees, rents or running costs associated
 with the ownership of long-term assets or maintenance of a certain characterist
ics (e.g.
 educational level, club membership etc.
 The costs such as maintenance fees or running costs can only contribute
 indirectly to the consumer's status-utility through the ownership of assets
 that impose such the costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To infer the non-durable costs incurred from assets (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t}.\rho)$
\end_inset

 ), we also use the average operation for some of the assets.
 For example, a refrigerator - which is expected to run 24 hrs a day - would
 have a different electricity requirement and hence the running costs compared
 to an electrical stove or agricultural equipment which is used less sparingly.
 On the other hand, the running costs for entertainment boats or musical
 equipment - whose running time is controlled by the user and is associated
 with leisure - are not considered part of the quality constraint.
 Other than the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, the price filter 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 also depends on the personal characteristics which may impose a certain
 lifestyle or habit on the consumer.
 For example, the consumers living in a remote area may have a zero consumption
 for certain commodities (
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)=0$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 for a certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

)

A consequence of the exogenous process is that the rich are more likely
 to stay rich than the poor are to become rich (otherwise there would be
 no stratification in the society).
 We would expect total quality per assets to be lower for the rich than
 it is for the poor - whose expectation for the long-term growth is lower
 but they are more likely to overweigh on the probabilistic growth through.
