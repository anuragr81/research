\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
A model for status consumption is derived based on the framework for intertempor
al consumption choice.
 Status is endogenised as states of financial stability and included as
 part of the consumer's utility in an intertemporal model for substitution
 between quality in non-durable consumption and savings for future assets.
 Theoretical and numerical solutions are discussed before estimation of
 the model for the Tanzanian LSMS consumption microdata over the years 2010,
 2012 and 2014.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard

Status consumption is ubiqutious.
 Certain items that are reserved for the rich often arouse interest of the
 not so rich.
 This is a known phenonmenn and is related to relative income.
 But what items determine them.
 Is there are level of general poverty - where visible consumption matters
 less.
 When a mass popoulation lives under property, do individuals view the futility
 or are less interested (roof material, no electricity).
 The demand model is explored to answer some of these questions.

 are some themese that are visited.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a conventional analysis of demand, the prices and quantities observed
 for the items suggest the relative importance of commodities with respect
 to each other.
 The demand for individual goods is often aggregated into commodities to
 compare the demand with its past values or values in a different population
 - thus providing a sense of quality for a particular commodity.
 Evidently, a detailed set of market prices of the goods within every commodity
 would be required if we were to view status consumption as an instance
 of high-quality consumption and use the measures of quality from the demand
 literature to measure status-related consumption.
 As the data on market prices is seldom available at local levels in most
 consumer surveys - we often use a so-called hedonic approach - arguing
 that the characteristics of the commodity are what consumers evaluate in
 forms of price.
 While demand literature often uses market characteristics or shadow prices
 for such analyses of quality for a particular commodity, the studies on
 conspicuous consumption tend to explore a specific instance of status consumpti
on instead.
 Here, conspicuous consumption is expected to occur through goods of a particula
r (visible) type that are meant to be futile for the general needs of the
 consumer.
 This assumption allows us to use to the separability of demand for visible
 goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to extend the concept of visible consumption in the developing
 economies, we intend to use the framework of demand analysis without this
 assumption of separability - arguing that the more general framework could
 status consumption in a more varied context.
 While such a model might not benefit from the tractability that the models
 for visible consumption benefit from, the estimates of wealth of the consumer
 (e.g.
 asset ownership in consumer data), if available, may allow us to observe
 how quality across commodities is consumed with respect to the wealth of
 the consumer.
 A general sense of status consumption - as we argue - must come from a
 combination of higher quality across commodities and a stable ownership
 of wealth or assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To elaborate the model, we enhance the framework for intertemporal consumer
 choice by adding long-term incentives and near-term demand for quality.
 In what could be seen as an attempt to refine a permanent income approach
 (which vigorously ignores all non-monetary wealth), we relate the consumption
 on quality with the long-term wealth proxied with personal characteristics
 and asset ownership.
 Viewing owned assets (durable items) owned as an indicator of wealth also
 comes in handy as the data available on income is often poor in the economies
 with a significant informal sector.
 In the environment of long-established income and asset inequalities, the
 high quality commodities are seen as the consumer's attempt to improve
 her perceived status.
 Arguing that consumption is myopic and depends on the perception of status
 in a near-term while savings are cumulative in an intertemporal model for
 consumer choice, we let the representative consumer in the model optimise
 a utility inclusive of status - which is obtained both by owned assets
 (including skills and characteristics that are acquired over multiple generatio
ns) and the quality of consumption.
 
\bar under
Since the 
\bar default
signalling benefit a consumer derives from consumption, must come out of
 either high-priced non-durable consumption or long-term durable consumption,
 we view the signaling as the utility obtained from the consumption of quality
 and owned assets over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key variables that the econometric methods arising out of this intertemporal
 substitution approach are concerned with are i) the extent to which the
 consumers maintain their habits of purchasing quality ii) the extent to
 which they choose to save for future assets rather than to overspend on
 higher quality in the current time period (measured simply as the distance
 - in monetary terms - from the cost of basic needs) and lastly iii) a measure
 of the cost of basic needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consideration of the cost of assets available to the consumer is of particular
 interest if we wish to compare status-related consumption in two economies
 with disparate levels of economic development (e.g.
 a developed economy and a developing economy).
 The distribution of assets - which may vary significantly in a developing
 economy from the distribution in a developed economy - provide us a way
 to compare the contexts of status consumption in the two economies.
 For a set of assets (long-term durable goods) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

 ordered by increasing cost, the difference in successive costs i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta d_{j}=d_{j}-d_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}\in\mathscr{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}<d_{j}\forall(i<j)$
\end_inset

 may be much higher relative to the cost of quality consumption in one economy
 relative to that in the other.
 These may have disparate effects on consumer choice in the two economies
 as the costlier long-term assets may discourage savings for the future
 (the consumer may give up hopes of acquiring assets if she is to remain
 in a low income group relative to asset costs) and the perceptions of high
 mobility may encourage the consumer to overspend on quality in the short-term
 (matching one's consumption to one's perceived status).
 As assets have a more definite impact on the consumer's secure long-term
 growth (assets being a stronger indicator the stability of her income),
 in equilibrium, the consumer would balance the more uncertain perception
 of her status with the more certain expected value of savings in her lifetime.
 Thus if income is assumed to follow a process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the consumer spending on her needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is known, then observing the proportion of consumer's spending on quality
 (which also determines the savings rate for durable goods in the intertemporal
 settings due to the total income constraint) with respect to the measures
 of wealth can help us comment on the contexts of status consumption in
 the two economies.
 This we believe is key to understanding status consumption across economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model we propose essentially compares the demand for long-term items
 vs that for demands short-term quality.
 Including assets and quality in a utility function, we consider the advantage
 from accumulated assets as well as that from the quality in the near term.
 Observing that a lot of non-durable consumption is related to the assets
 one owns, we also introduce a cost associated with owning assets in the
 intertemporal substitution framework.
 This explains how low income could create a trap of low-asset ownership
 for the consumers.
 In summary, we attempt to view status-related consumption in a conventional
 model for consumer demand - using the availability of asset costs in an
 economy and a definition of quality.
 We justify an interpretation of status consumption from quality and assets
 based on the assertion that for a rational consumer to spend on status
 consumption, she must see some status utility from consumption in the long-term
 or the short-term.
 To compare the status consumption in any two countries using our model,
 we seek econometric methods that measure the supply issues in the two economies
 and condition the demand on the macroeonomic differences in the two economies.
 Quality of consumption is measured as the distance of expensive nondurable
 consumption from the minimum cost of needs and any status value to the
 consumer in the short-run is assumed to be achieved through only the relative
 quality of consumption.
 The two primary goals we that our approach wishes to accomplish is i) to
 test whether the preference for quality increases with rise in income and
 urbanisation (indicated by the expansion of consumer basket) and ii) to
 see if preferences for quality change across populations segregated through
 levels of development, economic strata or social identities within an economy.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen sought to explore the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.

 - but Veblen doesn't dwell upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from
 more primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advancements of the last century in game theory and statistics have
 made us revisit many of Veblen's observations in more precise and quantitative
 terms - allowing us to interpret his early observations on the seeming
 irrationality of consumer behaviour with a framework for decision under
 risk.
 An understanding of the effect that human behaviour and social conditions
 have on a macroscopic level may still be far from complete
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "StraussEcoGeo2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, but the framework for decision under risk is very pertinent to status-related
 consumption.
 There are two threads in the literature that we find promising in this
 regard.
 The first is that of habit formation amongst consumers and the second on
 the relevance of social identities in visible consumption.
 We believe that a framework of decision under risk should allow us to link
 the two threads in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature from behavioural economics, marketing research and development
 economics all seem to concur on the tendencies of habit formation in consumer
 behaviour.
 The measurement of changes in habits and quality has a long tradition in
 neoclassical economics (see Fisher-Shell
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"

\end_inset

 for a classical treatment of the problem).
 Of particular interest is the model for myopia amongst consumers described
 by Muellbauer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MuellbauerRationalityMyopia1988."
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who notes the significance of lagged consumption on aggregate consumption.
 The life-cycle model used by Muellbauer has been of considerable importance
 in more recent studies on consumption where a rational utility-optimising
 consumer balances between the non-durable and durable consumption based
 on her planned savings over her life-time i.e.
 in an intertemporal substitution setting (a problem often treated equivalent
 to the classical utility maximising consumption problem).
 Improving upon the classical approach where the consumer is subservient
 to her optimised plan for life-time savings and consumption, a few behavioural
 approaches (see Shefrin-Thaler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ShefrinThaler1988"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for example) have sought descriptive models for mental accounting and factors
 such as willpower to better understand the development of habits in consumers.
 Unlike in the classical variants of the theory of consumer choice, the
 representative consumer in such models is subject to overeating, overspending,
 accumulating items she doesn't need or acquiring habits she cannot afford.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thread of literature on consumption that is more empirical in nature
 has observed how social identities play a role in status-signalling.
 Empirical studies in both the developed world and the developing countries
 find social group identities relevant to status-related consumption (see

 We belive that viewing status consumption with the intertemporal substitution
 framework could help connect the two threads in the literature.

 to move herself up in the ranking order.
 With a framework of social ranking and signaling therewith, Robert Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for example, finds that signaling needs become more important amongst the
 lower economic strata when they are huddled in the overpopulated suburban
 areas of big cities in the US.
 Inspecting similar behaviours in South Africa (see Kaus

\end_inset

 present evidence that the conspicuous consumption for consumers in S Africa
 is relative to lower or similar income-groups (rather than relative to
 higher income groups) .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the instances of status consumption under several cultural contexts
 seem to have a common theme of expenditure on signaling items - there may
 be a need to tread with caution when looking at demand of items in the
 developing countries that are considered conspicuous in the developed countries.
 This is because the relative wealth differences may be more relevant for
 status differences in the developing countries.
 The wealth differences being much larger and the industrial development
 much more concentrated in a developing country, the glaringly visible and
 sufficiently local (dense) wealth differences may have far more weight
 than the limited range of status items that a rational consumer may purchase
 (see Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for criticism of a 
\shape italic

\shape default
view of status consumption).
 On the other hand, rapid industrialisation and a transformation of consumer
 markets in many developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as Asia
 may imply a narrowing the income differences in the consumption and expansion
 of the industrial sector.
 These may make the consumption of status-related items significant enough
 to make Veblen's ostensibly dated insights on status relevant in the context
 of the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sociological studies have long indicated the role that industrial goods
 and income rises play in addressing of status needs by the consumers (see
 Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 , Ustuner-Holt
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UstunerHolt2010"

\end_inset

 ).
 In India of the 1950s, for example, Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SrinivasSanskritization"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 noted an instance of Veblen's pecuniary emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 (referred to as 
\shape italic
Sanskritization
\shape default
) as the erstwhile lower classes emulated the habits of higher social classes
 with their newly acquired economic freedoms.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, the habits of the upper economic classes were similarly
 observed to have expanded to the middle and lower classes in the decades
 after the second world war.
 In the post-feudal societies all over the world where consumer markets
 have developed, a new working class seems to have replaced the feudal or
 colonial order of the century before - attempting to emulate the former's
 behaviour.
 Still, while this setting is not unrelated to the one that Veblen had described
 in his treatise on conscpicuous consumption, there are many ways in which
 the context of the sub-Saharan African context is different from the American
 gilded age.
 One may find therefore that the status consumption in the developing countries
 in large part is merely an indication of wealth (see Khamis et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The questions in the consumer survey (which is how a researcher may obtain
 the list of visible items) may need to be adjusted to include items that
 may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A model of the particular conditions of the post-war developments that would
 consider the much higher levels of industrialisation and population growth
 since the last century - is probably key to understanding how the consumption
 is fundamentally different in our times.
 A model reflecting such conditions that has been of significant interest
 in the development economics literature is the Harris Todaro model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GollinLRF,HarrisTodaro1970"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 - which focuses on the urban and rural interactions in the developing countries
 while relating income differences with the consumer's uncertainty.
 The represenative consumer in the model (a worker/farmer) is meant to maximise
 her income and reduce the risk associated with it as she is faced with
 the choice of migration to the urban areas.
 To include relative income and wealth concerns in order to incorporate
 status-related consumption, one could enhance the model by refining the
 migration incentives to include goals of consumption quality and peer effects.
 A flight to urban areas - after all - may not be merely an escape from
 despondent circumstances but also serve as an entry to the expanded urban
 consumption basket and a (perceived) promise of social mobility - incentives
 that are of importance in any group behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peer effects for consumption have also been considered in the developing
 economics literature.
 One example is the Indian food budget squeeze (where per capita calorie
 intake seems to have declined as per capita income has increased) - which
 Sen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sen2005Calories,DeatonDrezeIndiaFood"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 attributes to the rise in the poverty-level for consumption of non-food
 items.
 More recently, Chai et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 have used a peer-effects approach to inspect the consumption on signaling
 items.
 In Sen view or in a general model considering long-term choices (e.g.
 migration, ownership of a house etc.) with the relative consumption of quality,
 a reference point separating basic needs from luxury or high-quality consumptio
n becomes a necessity.
 For much of the developing economics literature, this encompasses the discussio
n of poverty levels.
 In the developed economies where income inequalities are less of a concern
 and data on income is generally more reliable, it is relatively easier
 to separate the bare necessities from the luxuries to identify status consumpti
on.
 Focusing on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption in the regions of erstwhile East and West Germany after the
 economic liberalisation at the end of cold war, for example, Friehe et
 al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrieheGermany"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 have explored if prolonged measures of income equality can influence conspicuou
s consumption asymmetrically when there is a sudden rise in incomes.
 To develop a model with the effects of income and wealth differences in
 a more general setting however (e.g.
 that of a developing economy), one needs a clear definition of what constitutes
 the needs of the consumer and her consumption for status.
 Without a clear separation between needs and quality (or luxury) that is
 also general enough to be used across cultural contexts, the macroeconomic
 factors, issues of supply (e.g.
 income inequalities, distribution of resources etc.) may appear so intertwined
 with the needs of the consumer that a robust measure of status consumption
 can never be justified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the literature we have surveyed, the methods to standardise the macroeconomic
s inputs (welfare, growth, savings rate) and human needs have appeared far
 more rigorous than a definition of status-related consumption that is also
 general enough to be applied across various cultural contexts.
 The conspicuous consumption studies appear to make varied assumptions about
 what to include as part of conspicuous consumption and what not to.
 Some studies, for example, include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in the status-related items while others don't.
 In some cases, studies employ a consumer basket identified from a different
 economy on the basis of items being of conspicuous value by common knowledge.
 Except when a survey is used to identify 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption, the contents of the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 tend to have items that are just commonly understood to have some signaling
 value (jewelry etc.

\begin_layout Standard
The visibility surveys (see Heffetz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) often provide the means to get around the problem of the dependence of
 classification of status items on a particular cultural context.
 The survey approach to classification of status items also lends itself
 to tractable models (e.g.
 those provided by Ireland 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, Hopkins-Kornienko 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 With an assumption that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the
 regular sense - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for
 visible consumption may be considered separable (additively) from the utility
 for non-visible consumption (we refer to this assumption as the futility
 assumption henceworth) .
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 Despite this much desirable tractability of visible consumption (see Ireland

, Hopkins-Kornienko 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), we favour the an approach where snob and bandwagon behaviour form the
 fundamental mechanisms for status consumption.
 The latter approach allows us to include wealth differences and the quality
 in an intertemporal setting - which we find more general for the varied
 contexts of the developing world 
\begin_inset Foot

The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor

 We have found Corneo's terminology more tractable for empirical analyses

\begin_layout Standard
A certain ontological sense of status can be associated with the consumer's
 long-term security from the extreme fluctuations of in her wealth.
 This ontological sense of status i.e.
 the consumer's long-term stability of income is aligned with how status
 is measured in the literature from health and sociological sciences - which
 often track status with a vector of income, education and occupation (see
 Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 In the short-term however, the multitude of risks perceived by the consumer
 encompass the sense of status.
 This is the sense that is influenced with short-term consumption.
 Treating assets accumulated as an indicator of long-term wealth different
 from income, we use the intertemporal substitution to understand how the
 consumers may balance consumption in quality in the present with the savings
 for future assets.
 Thus, in addition to the dispersion in income amongst social classes (gauged
 with a simple variance in past income), we also consider the dispersion
 in quality and wealth owing to long-established hierarchies.
 This we believe is relevant to understanding the influence that wealth

Empirically, the long-term assets which are considered part of the consumer
 wealth are those that can be passed on to generations while the short-term
 concerns of the consumer (which are themselves influenced by the acquired
 wealth) comprise only of needs and quality.
 If there is any status related utility to be derived from non-durable consumpti
on, it would be constituted in the felicity from quality (which is defined
 as distance from needs).
 This is because the consumer with a habit of high-quality in consumption
 (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfilment of consumer needs itself however carries no such influence
 on status.
 Similarly, any status that is not signaled with non-durable consumption
 i.e.
 quality must come out of long-term assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the utility to the consumer under the intertemporal setting where
 she balances the two competing tendencies also considers the peer effects
 which she faces.
 The utility function quantifies the advantage a consumer receives by deviating
 from the the average values of the particular status determinants (i.e.
 quality and asset ownership) pertaining to the consumer's immediate surrounding
s (with respect to a locality, a relevant social group, income or asset-owner
 group etc.).
 
\begin_inset Foot

Quality differences may exist amongst the long-term assets as well.
 However, if assets are sparingly available in the consumer population,
 it may be suffice to consider the difference between having an asset and
 not having the asset.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If for example, the individuals with high asset ownership live in a region
 different than where those with low asset ownership reside, the consumer
 is not expected see so much benefit from consumption of quality.
 The consumption of quality would thus be segregated based on asset ownership
 or characteristics associated with long-term asset ownership (e.g.
 region, social identity etc.).
 Since the social interaction between groups segregated based on assets
 is minimised, this imposes a constraint on the movement of consumption
 quality away from assets (see the discussion of cost associated with asset
 ownership for a further discussion on covement of quality and asset ownership).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
While the models 
\bar default
for visible consumption can also be extended to incorporate the peer effects,
 we find that an approach that endogenises wealth and assets directly is
 more general for the developing world context.
 So instead of using a framework for demand with a certain items that are
 known a priori to have a status carrying potential, we use a model which
 marks a substitution between the accumulation of long-term assets or characteri
stics and the short-term relative quality.
 By means of an analogy, consider a market for cars where status is signalled
 through car ownership.
 The significance of visible consumption means that the consumers pay more
 attention to outward appearance of the car (the body work, paint, rims
 etc.
 - which definitely futile) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality
 of tyres etc.).
 But if we were to compare the signaling through car ownership in the urban
 and rural areas, we would also want to see i) the price differences in
 the cars being sold in the market and ii) the constraints on occupation
 and income that exist in the respective areas.
 In the context of status consumption, while it may be true that individuals
 spend more on their outward appearances and visible goods (despite controlling
 for everything else like occupation, income), visible consumption is not
 all what status consumption over time may comprise of (see the Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and Eastman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for varied terminology around status consumption).
 Not all high quality consumption is visible.
 In particular, some higher quality non-durable consumption (such as using
 electricity in a developing country) may not be visible in nature but must
 accompany higher durable consumption that may in turn be visible (electrical
 equipment etc.).
 Similarly, while a visible item is effectively a high-quality item (since
 visibility is priced in the market), not all visible consumption may qualify
 as high quality consumption either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is straightforward to include visible consumption in our framework if
 it is viewed in relation to the ownership of assets or long-term wealth.
 If the consumer preferences for needs across different commodity groups
 and the assets she acquires are considered, visibility through non-durable
 consumption (i.e.
 visible consumption) can be seeb as a preference order for quality across
 the groups.
 More particularly, as prices of commodities change or new goods are introduced,
 the consumer may adjust her quality of non-durable consumption (once her
 needs are met) based on a preference order over the commodity groups.
 For example, a consumer may consider quality for transport more important
 than quality in food (or vice versa).
 One could say that the commodities such as food are less visible than household
 or entertainment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term needs does
 not view status consumption as futile but relates it with an expectation
 of social mobility - which the consumer considers after fulfilment of basic
 needs and which is influenced both with long-term possessions and non-durable
 consumption.
 The relevance of a social-identity to status is viewed in terms of an expectati
on of high status through a history of past asset ownership, incomes/occupations
 (a criterion that makes the consumer raise her expectations through association
 with the identity).

Status as utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A property of utility function from where much of the model could follow
 is that status is constituted in the consumer's long-term utility.
 If not, the model's representative consumer would have no reason to engage
 in status-related consumption in any form.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a
 consumer can a achieve higher status in the model not only by the acquisition
 of assets (which is assisted with higher income) but also by the status
 promotion through consummption (which may enhanced social interactions
 and improve self-image).
 The role of non-durable consumption is therefore two-fold in the model
 - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer and second, it
 also matches the high-quality consumption with status related goals.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity in
 the present as well as a possible status advantage - since all else being
 the same, someone consuming a higher quality is likely to have more status
 than someone consuming a lower quantity.

 We also argue that assets themselves would cause of this 
\shape italic

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth clarifying that by tracking the consumer's deviation from her
 needs and matching consumption of quality with the consumer's utility for
 status, we do not intend to make any descriptive claims about the consumer's
 belief.
 Since consumption is myopic while savings are cumulative, the association
 of a felicity from quality is only a way to differentiate the more certain
 indicators of status from those that contribute to the deviation from fulfillme
nt of basic needs in the short-term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also worth emphasising that conspicuous consumption should not appear
 trivialised when viewed as mere higher-quality consumption.
 We find that a lot of appeal for conspicuous consumption in the public
 discourse is formed due to it being presented as a phenomenon that only-serves-
the-rich.
 Even though a conspicuous item is seen as an item that is used both to
 distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself, there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst
 the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 A view that considers conspicuous consumption a way to distinguish oneself
 from one's own reference group and the reference wealth level through consumpti
on would need to admit a more general definition of status consumption that
 considers the effect of the distance from fulfilment of basic needs on
 the the consumer's signaling.
 If we can agree that the signaling behaviour can be exhibited by everyone
 and cause a direct improvement of the consumer's perceived status, then
 an increase in her consumption corresponding to her perceived status is
 justified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason to object to the view of status consumption as a consumption
 exclusive to the rich is that the utility to the rich from status consumption
 might be quite little given that the rich consumer already has enough to
 distance herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower-asset ownership.
 The argument that considers conspicuous consumption as only serving the
 rich may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have
 anyone else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave
 anyone behind).
 We argue instead that even the poorest may want to indicate that they are
 not the poorest - much the way the richest may want it to be known to the
 others that they are indeed the richest

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Made ubiquitous through expanding markets and increased awareness of items
 through advertisement, therefore, signaling through non-durable consumption
 is needed for everybody - as everyone in the middle (those who are neither
 the richest nor the poorest) must also try to avoid getting poorer and
 try to become the richest at all times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fundamental way in which our model differs from those of visible consumption
 is that there is a private utility to be derived from status consumption
 in the model.
 This warrants some clarification as many empirical studies have viewed
 visible consumption as a kind that provides only public utility (and no
 private utility).
 In the view that motivates our model, a luxury watch may be futile for
 private use by itself (when compared to its cheaper alternatives with same
 functionality), but if an aspiring businessman uses his knowledge of luxury
 watches to find new clients for her business, then the futile consumption
 can translate into a material advantage.
 The perception of status - however unrealistic - can influence one's wealth
 if everyone in one's reference group also acts in accordance to the perception.
 It may be apt to consider conspicuous consumption futile but only in a
 sense that is different from what a modeler would be concerned with.
 Items like luxury watches are important only because the rich flock around
 them.
 Thus if the rich (the clients of our model businessman) were to move away
 from luxury watches, the utility from the luxury watches would be none.
 Admittedly, this is the sense in which conspicuous consumption is always
 futile.
 However, the peer effects that conspicuous items accompany is important
 as it acts as a means of connecting the rich with the not-so rich.
 In the example of luxury watches, indeed only a few of the purchasers of
 luxury watches would improve their self-image - enhancing their social
 networks - while others may remain mere purchasers.
 What matters is that a certain number of buyers of luxury watches actually
 achieve success over the long term and influence the peers in their reference
 group whose members can observe the success.
 As explained before, we are not concerned with how many of the businessmen
 actually believe that conspicuous consumption would help them (i.e.
 we do not attempt to describe their beliefs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the operationalisation of the model, the long-term assets and the income
 process provide the environment where the consumer's non-durable consumption
 is observed.
 Here, the items or characteristics that are passed on to the next generation
 are considered long-term assets while those that cannot be passed are considere
d short-term.
 The factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.

Needs, wealth and consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having argued that both quality and ownership of long-term assets contribute
 to the consumer's long-term status, we now turn to how a consumer may achieve
 both in the context of needs and prices.
 Our view of non-durable status-related consumption is essentially that
 of non-necessary consumption - and thus empirically, it must rely on a
 sound definition of needs - which provide the reference point for quality
 in the model.
 That there must be the idea of universal needs may itself be a contentious
 issue.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs can supersede
 her subjective interests (wants).
 We lean towards an objective middle-path proposed by Doyal and Gough
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need
 of the consumer without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts should be standardised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an empirical analysis, health and autonomy are fairly abstract ideas
 when the context of consumption is not limited to food and employment.
 When considering quality in food, for example, this is a relatively easier
 task as we may just consider the cost of the cheapest option for proteins,
 carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area.
 For contexts other than food, however, what constitutes basic needs is
 less trivial.
 For example, what constitutes a basic house or a basic set of furniture
 would require some justification based on a cultural or geographic context.
 Standardising needs in terms of the quantity of non-durable consumption
 poses another issue - since the non-durable consumption may depend on the
 long-term assets that the consumer possesses.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and thus a high non-durable consumption
 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical assets would not have
 the respective non-durable consumption).
 To get around the issue, we therefore consider needs associated with a
 certain asset level.
 Once the level of needs in a population of consumers is established, the
 cost of needs of the consumer are driven the local price of the needs and
 a certain personal characteristics (e.g.
 residence in an expensive region) as well as the assets one possesses.
 This is discussed in more detail in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ModelDynamics"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that status is not considered a need using this
 approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the asset
 level she achieves while the her basic needs are independent of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both assets
 and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and income of the
 consumer (rather than high-class or low-class needs of the consumer).
 As an example, the difference between the status of a rich and that of
 a poor family in our model is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 the family combined with a demand for quality for education (with a higher
 price for higher quality).
 It may thus be possible to proxy the needs of the family simply by number
 of members in the family (adjusted by their age).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference point of needs is crucial to our view of quality as it is
 simply a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 If the quality of consumption or excess calculated in such a manner is
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\Psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of assets owned 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Since consumption changes with the perceptions of wealth, the dependence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\rho$
\end_inset

 can give more structure to the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon$
\end_inset

.
 For example, while a consumer may want to improve quality instead of saving
 for an asset, the quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may not be improved beyond a certain point until more assets are purchased.
 For example, in the household category, high prices of housing may encourage
 the consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus improve 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) but she may improve the quality instead of buying a bigger house only
 until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 Here, the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 moves together with assets that the consumer acquires.
 In other words, there are clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 that are associated with a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We discussion the modeling of peer effect in a later section but the dependence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\nu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 also has implications on the additivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\Psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

.
 The limited substitution between assets and non-durable consumption allows
 us to express the utility function as 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon=f(A)+g(\Psi)+m(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 As the consumer matches her consumption with her status goals and a certain
 high quality non-durable consumption is available only when associated
 with a corresponding asset or a long-term characteristic (such as education,
 housing, identity, region owing to segregation, trade barriers etc.), higher
 quality choices would accompany higher-quality assets.
 The substitution between low-quality asset and high-quality non-durable
 consumption being limited due to co-movement of expensive non-durable consumpti
on with expensive asset ownership also means that the quality differences
 in the assets can be ignored.
 A high-quality asset is thus merely a more expensive asset in the utility
 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(A,\rho,\nu)$
\end_inset

 in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider how price derivatives may enter the utility and consumer
 decision.
 Without price changes, the consumption of quality would change only when
 individuals acquire long-term durable goods or give up hopes of acquiring
 costlier assets (possibly due to other needs).
 As the consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality, a rise in
 quality must come either from an increase in income or from an undercut
 in savings.
 Similarly, if needs stay the same, a drop in quality must be due to purchase
 of assets or a drop in income.
 Empirically, the prices are attached with a commodity rather than overall
 quality.
 So, to consider price changes, one must consider the price of needs as
 well as the price of quality across the various commodities.
 Faced with change in prices, a consumer may prefer quality in one commodity
 over another (i.e.
 a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport to food or
 vice versa) as she addresses her needs and long-term assets requirements.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider a middle-income family that
 moves to a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants
 are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place.
 One way to view this change in the consumer's circumstances is to observe
 that the price of entertainment services are lower for the consumer in
 the new neighborhoods.
 Assuming the needs of the family (indicated by the number of family members)
 haven't changed, the consumption would either shift to saving for a better
 car or improve quality in some other category (better jewelry, better schooling
 for kids etc.) in response to price changes or a equivalent changes in income.
 The sensitivity of consumption with respect to price thus comprises of
 sensitivity with respect to basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\Psi_{t}}$
\end_inset

as well as a sensitivity with respect to quality for each commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\nu_{t}}$
\end_inset

.

Model Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the properties of the utility function discussed so far, we now discuss
 how the observed variables which the consumer evaluates to exercise her
 choice of quality that is turn measured as the distance from cost of basic
 needs.
 These observed variables are the i) needs of the consumer ii) her income
 and iii) the assets she owns.
 To measure the quality chosen by the consumer, we observe the consumption
 within certain categories (which for in the current chapter are food, energy,
 transport and household).
 These variables are then assimilated in the Euler equations of the intertempora
l substitution problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The additive form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\Psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 means that there is a substitution between quality and assets.
 A consumer could achieve the same utility - inclusive of status - as that
 of a consumer with with higher education or higher asset ownership by raising
 her high-quality consumption.
 Similarly, the asset-owners need not purchase quality to stay ahead of
 others.
 Empirically, however, we note that high quality in non-durable often is
 constrained by asset ownership.
 Those who own a refrigerator spend less on kerosene for their energy needs
 compared to those who don't own a refrigerator.
 If we measure quality as the distance from cost of needs, there is a sunken
 cost the refrigerator owner incurs due to her asset ownership.
 If we wish to view quality after having conditioned for such costs in order
 to avoid double-counting the advantage the asset owner has, we ought to
 separate the quality demanded by the consumer from that which is incurred
 due to asset ownership.
 To ask whether the refrigerator owners spend more on exotic fruits than
 those those who don't, we must separate the running costs of the refrigerator
 from the measurement of quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Two measures address this standardisation of demand - first is the classificati
on of quality in separable commodities e.g.
 food, energy so that we may compare demand for quality in food with that
 for quality in household goods or transport.
 The second is the introduction of a cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A_{t},\rho)$
\end_inset

 - which accounts for the cost of maintaining assets or similar characteristics
 (such as education or social class) 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is possible that ownership of some assets generates some rental income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, we would prefer to treat such income as an additional stream of income
 instead treating it as negative costs in the model.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This takes care of the peer-effects to some extent - giving more weight
 to quality consumed by non-asset owners than would be if we didn't include
 the cost of assets.

Needs of the consumer

\begin_layout Standard
As we have briefly discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:nonstochproblem"

\end_inset

, our notion of quality is dependent on what we consider as needs rather
 than the characteristics of items (see Rosen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RosenImplicitHedonic1974"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a summary of hedonic approaches).
 We define needs as the standard requirements not meeting which would lead
 to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the theory argued for by Doyal
 and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, the counter-argument
 would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the consumer incurred
 by not having other nutrients is definite - thus ruling out a starch diet
 fulfilling the set of dietary needs.
 However, such a theory of needs is a normative concern (rather than descriptive
) - as a consumer may not always want her needs.
 Such a model for needs cannot represent a situation where consumers forgo
 a certain need to compromise on their health or autonomy in favour of some
 other wants.
 This makes the task to ensure that the needs are indeed just a minimum
 necessary set for health and autonomy to the individual extremely important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the minimum requirements for commodities such as food, clothing,
 housing and employment and calculate the costs associated with them in
 the local context (at a district level in the Tanzanian data - for example).
 The needs are then adjusted based on the assets one possesses.
 If a household possesses a car, then the needs of the household are incremented
 with the petrol consumption per year.
 Thus, some cost of needs (e.g.
 for food) are multiplied by the number of household members in the family
 while other needs are calculated per household to obtain the net cost of
 needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for a household.
 The details of the this process are explained in Section

\begin_layout Standard
Relying only on total costs associated with a commodity (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality or 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
cannot differentiate between the consumption of a higher quantity and of
 a higher quality.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 for a commodity priced 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$
\end_inset

, then our quality metric for the consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

).
 However, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity are
 available in the region or not, it is possible to draw conclusions about
 over-consumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity.
 This is particularly so when using pseudo-panel analyses for the data.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of using an income process in the model is to provide an exogenous
 way to differentiate increase in household incomes from the accumulation
 of assets.

 our interpretation of status consumption as a scale of quality

 What this means empirically is that while the exogenous income process
 may depend on education or occupation levels, the effect that long-term
 characteristics have on consumption are not necessarily through income
 but through constraints that the long-term characteristics bring.
 As the effects of on consumption are modeled explicitly, it would suffice
 if the income process models an the monetary growth i.e.
 a reflection of the steady growth in the economy on to the consumer's budget.
 For the analysis of the Tanzanian data therefore, we have assumed an income
 process dependent on long-term characteristics characteristics such as
 education and occupation.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Change in asset ownership over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wealth of a consumer is represented in the model with a combination
 of accumulated assets and long-term characteristics (education, occupation
 or social identity).
 The asset ownership is modeled with an asset account - whose value is reflected
 in the total cost of assets inclusive of cash assets that the consumer
 owns.
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase assets and the actual purchase
 of assets.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all assets in
 the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success to preferences
 being the same for everybody) that provides furniture, housing and all
 amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every asset and service - offered as a life-long subscription - can be
 purchased by giving an amount to this company.
 We also assume that at the of the lifetime of a consumer, her personal
 wealth would either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so
 that the asset account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth
 of some other household(s) in the economy.
 Consequently, while all individuals in the population are assumed to be
 the same as our representative consumer in terms of the preferences for
 needs over quality, they differ in the the starting amount of their asset
 accounts as well as the trends of their salaries, the trajectory of their
 needs and their quality habits of quality (

).
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and her salary after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 then at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased assets from a portion of her income and decided
 that she does not want more assets for the rest of her life.
 Alternatively, her life circumstances might have changed (she may need
 a bigger house or want a more expensive house) thus needing more assets
 urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

, asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Due to the minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing countries,
 we assume a negligible credit in the market.
 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only asset available in the market.

Dynamic Optimisation

\begin_layout Standard
Given the variables - cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

, owned assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 and observed consumption on quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 that are observed in the data, we now turn to a quality control in the
 Euler equations of the intertemporal setting that represents the consumer
 choice for quality.
 By definition of the needs, a consumer is meant to select a quality control
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 only after her needs and those imposed by the owned assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well as her personal characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 are fulfilled (the lack of subscript in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is due to the assumption that the personal characteristics don't change
 in our near-term analysis).
 Thus we view the control for quality (
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) simply the distance in terms of money from the cost of needs for the household.
 The higher its value the higher would be the distance from the basic needs
 consumption (and lower would be the future growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Other than the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, the consumption depends both on needs and the long-term choices of the
 consumer (which are encapsulated by the asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 the consumer has accumulated in the past and the the personal characteristics
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 she possesses).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-durable costs imposed by the assets one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.) imply either that avoiding the respective expenses is
 not an option for the consumer owning some assets or that some certain
 long-term choices or characteristics (e.g.
 not having a house or living in a region that doesn't have electricity
 available) would limit the choice to avail quality through non-durable
 consumption.
 For example, a homeowner is required to maintain her own house the way
 someone who doesn't own the house has to pay the rent.
 As some costs are incurred due to the assets that the consumer acquires,
 a distance from the basic needs (which are themselves imposed only by health
 and autonomy requirements) could be introduced as the consumer acquires
 more assets.
 Such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

extended
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 needs of the consumer as she acquires assets necessitate a parameter in
 the model that is different from the quality control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and separates how much the consumer choice is related to her long-term
 standing influenced by 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 from how much quality is demanded in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 As discussed in the Section

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest instance of intertemporal substitution is a two period model
 where assets are meant to be liquidated at the end of the second period.
 If one may assume that the relative preference of quality over assets does
 not change over time, the utility to be optimised by the consumer in the
 two-period model can be written as

 In the typical solution of the intertemporal problem, the wealth constraint
 could be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\frac{A_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}}+\frac{c_{1}-p_{1}}{1+r}+\frac{c_{2}-p_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}}$
\end_inset

 so that Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L=U-\lambda(W-\frac{A_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}}-\frac{c_{1}-p_{1}}{1+r}-\frac{c_{2}-p_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}})$
\end_inset

 leads to the first order conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial L}{\partial\nu_{1}}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\nu_{2}}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\lambda}=0$
\end_inset

 Notice however that one cannot guarantee 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial f(\nu_{2})}{\partial\nu_{1}}=0$

\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 This is where the boundary condition of the final asset state being 0 (i.e.
 all of the consumer's assets being liquidated and consumed in the last
 period) and a discount factor for expected state (whose Euler equations
 are specified) help simplify the optimisation problem

This solution a the non-stochastic intertemporal problem essentially draws
 an equivalence between total wealth constraint

 of the classical consumer choice problem ) before employing similar econometric
 methods.
 Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=\beta ln(x)+\gamma ln(p)+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 commonly used in estimation is effectively derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=p_{i}q_{i}/x\Rightarrow log(w_{i})=log(p_{i})+log(g(x,p))-log(x)$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,p)$
\end_inset

 as the Marshallian demand function, using the double-logarithmic model
 (which is a mere restatement of existence of elasticities through total
 differentiation) yields 
\begin_inset Formula $log(g(x,p))=\alpha_{i}+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}log(x)+\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p)}log(p)$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $log(w_{i})=\alpha_{i}+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(x)}-1)log(x)+(\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{i})}+1)log(p_{i})+\sum_{j\ne i}\frac{\partial log(g(x,p))}{\partial log(p_{j})}log(p_{j})$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the adding up restriction is more difficult to impose on this form rather
 than the slightly modified :

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the latter is the more popular choice.
 An estimation of demand elasticities of consumption can be performed with
 parallel arguments using the total wealth constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

.
 In this equivalent formulation, the constraint for the consumer can be
 stated as the total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\delta_{i}(A_{T}+\sum c_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 are the assets accumulated over the period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 the consumption in period 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and the discount factors can be chosen as
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{i}=\frac{1}{(1+r)^{i}}$
\end_inset

 (this holds even if one assumes that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 is 0 at the end by the consumer spending everything as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{T}$
\end_inset

 at the end of period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

).
 Equivalent to the case of income constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}=x$
\end_inset

 for the maximisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\textbf{q})$
\end_inset

, the wealth constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is meant to be known to the representative consumer i.e.
 the consumer chooses a plan for 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i},A_{i}$
\end_inset

 knowing what her total wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and future expectations of prices are.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since we consider the final state of assets exogenous in our model, we
 take a slightly different approach with the formulation of a dynamic optimisati
on problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the initial and final asset levels known, the Euler equations can be
 written as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{3...}$
\end_inset

 being undefined) in the periods 1 and 2 while she bears the cost of the
 needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 (in periods 1 and 2 respectively).
 The intertemporal substitution setting means that she may save for asset
 growth to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of consuming all her income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu_{t}+\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 she can spend all her income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1},i_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}$
\end_inset

 (respectively) or save some of it towards 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

 If initial conditions are 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 (the starting wealth), the rate of growth of money (interest rate) and
 an exogenous income process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 are known, we can expand the the Euler equations as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
A_{1}=A_{0}(1+r)+i_{1}-c_{1}=A_{0}(1+r)+i_{1}-\Psi_{1}-\nu_{1}\\

\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

 Assuming that we observe both states of the wealth, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0},A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

, as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2},$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 we can then to solve for the parameters that govern the utility function
 additive over time 
\begin_inset Formula $u=u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are utilities over periods and 1 and 2 (respectively).
 To motivate the dynamic optimisation approach, consider the consumer's
 choices in a one-period consumption - where she could either spend all
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{_{1}}=\nu_{1}+\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or keep the minimum consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0,c_{1}=\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

) in the period and end up with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, then the first-order conditions would provide us the optimal condition
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Let this utility be 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*},A_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 To extend this to two periods with dynamic optimisation one can exploit
 the fact that a consumer independently optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 would always obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are unbounded functions 
\begin_inset Formula $max(u_{1}+u_{2})\le max(u_{1})+max(u_{2})=u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is only a tool to formulate the dynamic optimisation approach - using which
 the expected value of utility is to be optimised over her life period in
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

-period model (
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 being the age of the consumer).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The changes in expected utility per period are what drive her behaviour
 at every period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and her choice is set to vary according to her age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (assuming that all consumers have similar expectations for the trajectory
 of their needs).
 A steady state would thus be achieved with 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 over all ages.
 The conditions of stability of the steady state imply that while consumers
 maintain different 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 , they are a function of characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

and age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the notion that a consumer may change her behaviour away from the
 current plan in the future is fallacious since a consumer observed at different
 ages is equivalent to consumers of varied ages at any point in time (see
 Deaton's clarification of the so-called dynamic inconsistency problem 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Understanding Consumption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 In other words, the behaviour of an older consumer is the same as the future
 behaviour of a younger consumer.
 So the optimal solution for the total sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{T-t}u_{i}$
\end_inset

 would apply both to the individuals of all ages as well as an individuals
 over a number of years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Peer Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the preference of assets vs quality does not change over time,
 consider the inclusion of personal characteristics in the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum_{t}\beta_{t}(\upsilon_{t})$
\end_inset

 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\upsilon_{t} & =a\ log(A_{t})+b\ log(\nu_{i})+(1-a-b)log(\rho)\label{eq:utility_with_rho}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This allows the the consumer to compensate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 More educated people (or those with higher percieved class) might need
 less assets and less quality.
 On the other hand, due to the high upfront cost attached to owning assets,
 there may be a certain levelling effect to how much assets can be used
 to compensate for not having the best 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

- a limiting factor that would lead to the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 dominating the choice for the consumer.
 The ownership of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is thus likely to be segregated over a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 In the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:utility_with_rho"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 or its equivalent formulations, an influential 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has two competing roles for the consumer utility - first, it allows the
 consumer to not require so much assets.
 Second, it requires the consumer to maintain a certain level that is required
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 she possesses.
 This interplay of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is indeed how peer effects - the claim that the consumer considers quality
 relative to her reference group rather than an absolute level enter the
 model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If peer effects were to be modeled explicitly, let's say through a distance
 from average 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 calculated over 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (or a belonging to an ordinal class - see Chai), then as long as the higher
 status rank (part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) are also wealthy, the consumer with a high status rank due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would also need to keep up the quality consumption to her wealthier reference
 level.
 Therefore, those in the higher rank (e.g.
 higher status occupations etc.) would benefit both from being in a higher
 status group (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) and from the higher asset possession that entails being in the high status
 group (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 To avoid double-accounting for the effect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has on the utility, we choose only the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that form the reference group over which the distance from average consumption
 is considered relevant for peer effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some recent literature has found an ordinal treatment of status more suitable
 for modeling status-related consumption.
 We believe that the properties of the average over the chosen personal
 characteristic - allows us to consider an ordinal treatment without losing
 the tractability of averages in estimation.
 If we are sure to consider only the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that can serve as a reference group for consumption, then the presence
 of peer effects only means that the consumer does not worry about having
 less 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 than the average of a community (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 ) she does not consider herself a member of.
 Instead, the utility derived by being ahead of the local average (of quality
 or assets) i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is more significant to her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider a market of just quality (and no assets) as an illustration.
 Here, a model for utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $S=a\nu+b\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu$
\end_inset

 which is similar to the Ireland's signaling model - in the sense that the
 utility is a combination of private and public sub-utilities.
 The decomposition of the model as 
\begin_inset Formula $S=a\nu+b\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu=a(\nu-\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu)+(a+b)\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu)$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as how the total utility can be seen as a combination
 of the sub-utility from the distance in quality from the local average
 and that from the overall effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 This interpretation permits us to approximate the second term with a function
 solely of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 while the first term with a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer thus maintains both a relative advantage and the collective
 absolute advantage from quality - without issues of double-accounting.
 The approach would not change if difference in assets were introduced in
 the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the measurement of distance from needs or 
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
 - which we track with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is no direct measure for peer effects.
 The distance from needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in fact only encompasses the higher price of the items or their consumed
 quantity.
 As such 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is reflects spatial variation in prices as well and thus the controls for
 spatial variation must be included in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 over which peer effects are considered.
 More generally, the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that may serve as an appropriate cluster over which 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu$
\end_inset

 is evaluated are driven by the particular dataset at hand.
 Out of the characteristics like region, occupation or education, one may
 be more important than the others rest in a particular context.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Intertemporal Substitution Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we introduce the assets in the model, the Euler equations of the intertempora
l setting allow us to model to what extent the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 may move together with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.Towards the goal of viewing the relative preference of quality with respect
 to asset ownership, the intertemporal setting prevents an assumption of
 comovement of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (on the lines of the permanent income approach).
 Finally, therefore the model we use has the following utility function:

Here

 The last assumption rests upon the definition of assets being intergenerational

Cost of Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input for the cost of needs is the diary of food items and the recall
 diary for upto one year.
 The consumption of the items that are considered necessities is calculated
 for over an year.
 The cost of needs thus calculated in this manner (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) depend on the particular locality where the household is located.
 Given the categories of consumption in Tanzania i.e.
 food, household, energy and transport, we calculate the cost of basic needs
 as the cost minimal requirements in every category.
 As an example, we use the commodity sub-groups of carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables in the food category.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - which is composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - are then calculated in each region and district based
 on the prices of the items recorded in the survey (which records the prices
 at the district level as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket could be a
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - as these are most often
 the cheapest items in their respective sub-group (
\begin_inset Formula ${carb,fact,protein,fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the cost of this basket thus calculated is much higher
 in the urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

 The cost thus calculated is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the food component of

Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on which energy source a household uses for lighting and
 cooking is used from the household questionnaire to evaluate the total
 cost of the energy needs.

 The running costs of the house - depending on whether it's owned or rented

 as well.
 When the house is rented, the running costs are simply the reported rent
 on the house whereas when the house is owned by the household, a 2.5% of
 the cost of the house is used (the maintenance rate is estimated based
 on the expenditure reported in the survey for the houses that report maintenanc

 The matching of need with the level of assets owned is similar to how the

Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the income process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

, we use the reported income from primary occupations in the Tanzania LSMS
 data over the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 One limitation of the Tanzanian LSMS data is that it does not provide income
 data for every household head for which the consumption diary and assets
 are recorded.
 Another limitation of the data set is that a household that is visited
 in a particular year is less likely to be visited after more than 2 years.
 This means that while a significant number households would be common between
 2010 and 2012 as well as between 2012 and 2014, very few households that
 were visited in 2010 would be visited the third time in 2014 (in fact less
 than 100 household from the survey in 2010 seem to be visited in 2014 for
 income survey).
 Such a lack of a true panel data compels us to prepare a pseudo-panel for
 the calibration of the income process.
 The pseudo-panel we prepare is based on the similarity of the number of
 adults, the number of children, the year of birth of the adults, the occupation
 and education levels
\begin_inset Foot

A minor issue encountered while the preparation of the pseudo-panel related
 to the age of the household members was circumvented with an approximate
 matching of that year-of-birth values.
 The LSMS community survey appears to have recorded the year-of-birth values
 for individuals in years 2010 and 2012 but the age variable is recorded
 instead for the year 2014.
 Matching the year-of-birth values from 2012 with the YOB values inferred
 from the recorded age was made possible by allowing a tolerance for matching
 the YOB values for the preparation of the pseudo-panel.

Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the assets
 used by the household.
 The list of assets recorded in the survey includes everything from a mobile
 phone to land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these assets).
 The details of records include the number of assets owned by the household,
 the reported cost at which the asset was purchased and the price the household
 expects by selling the asset in the market at the time of the survey.
 While these data fields are promising for the intertemporal setting we
 wish to make use of, a refinement of this data is necessary due to the
 measurement errors with the costs and the current price (referred to as
 marked-to-market average or mtm average in the current discussion).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue with the reported cost is typical of those based on a consumer
 recall.
 Recorded by the survey at two time-points spread across two years (let's
 call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs may change over a period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same asset in 2012 may be significantly different
 from the cost recorded in 2014.
 To some extent, the reported cost of the assets follows the mtm average
 which itself is less susceptible to the issue as it is not recalled from
 consumer's memory and reflects the perceived depreciation of the asset
 over time instead.
 The mtm average of the asset (like the cost of the asset) is a value averaged
 over the number of assets owned by consumer.
 Therefore, the cost incurred by the purchase of a new asset - that we're
 interested in - is not directly observed in the mtm average and relies
 on the field indicating number of assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the value of new purchases relies on the number of assets observed in
 the survey, we detect an asset purchase only when a difference in the number
 of assets over the successive years is observed.
 The difference between the mtm average is thus recorded as part of new
 assets only as long as we observe a difference in number of assets in the
 two-year period (i.e.
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 The number of assets observed however is also subject to some measurement
 error and requires some further refinements to the cost of assets thus
 calculated.
 Since we are interested in the the new asset purchases for our analysis,
 however, someone buying their first music player is less susceptible to
 counting errors than someone adding to their collection of music systems.
 The asset number changes are counted towards change in assets only if they
 change from 0 to 1 or substantially (3 to 5 or to 6,7...
 etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible issue with a calculation of asset cost changes as outlined above
 is that the measurement error with the number of assets may get magnified
 for more expensive assets such as house.
 However, since we also observe whether the individual owns a house or not
 from the household questionnaire (which records the housing-status through
 a direct question), we can confirm that this error is not significant after
 reconcile the calculated differences with the data from the household questionn
aire.
 What this reconciliation does remind us however is that the assets recorded
 in the survey indicate whether the household uses (or has access to) the
 assets rather than what it owns
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A lot of households in rented or employer-provided houses report having
 a house.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since rental options - except for housing - are fairly limited in the developin
g economies, this does not pose a significant measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final caveat for the data is the presence of split households.
 A significant portion of the households may split into two or more households.
 Considering a split household as the terminal state of a household, we
 don't consider the parent household while calculating asset differences
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 if it has terminated in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, asset differences are included only as long as the households
 have not split in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+1$
\end_inset

.
 As explained in the discussion of the model, we only wish to consider assets
 that can can potentially transferred over generations (we can verify these
 when the households are split).
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data, we consider any asset more expensive than bed
 as eligible to be transferred to the next generation.
 This can be verified with the data on split household.
 The assets in the survey that are not life-long assets e.g.
 mobile phones, dish-tv etc.
 are not considered in the asset changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{\tau+1}=A_{\tau+1}-A_{\tau}$

 See Figure

 for a cost( median ) order of the assets recorded in 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For robustness tests to our conclusions, we attempt to both sharpen and
 smoothen the data on assets by considering purchases within coarser groups
 such as electronic items, furniture etc.
 and by turning off the effect of depreciation in the asset difference calculati
on respectively.
 The first test to sharpen the data is with classification of new assets
 into coarser categories - which is useful in its own right to interpret
 the distribution of functional assets - since counting the instances of
 purchases of just any electronic item may make more sense than the purchase
 of individual items such as a music system or a CD player.
 The appeal of the grouping approach is also due the extreme differences
 in urban and rural markets in an economy like Tanzania.
 Grouping the assets into agricultural electronic, electric and livestock
 categories accentuates the minor additions to one's assets - by treating
 cheaper assets purchased by the consumer the same treatment as more expensive
 assets.
 The downside with such a grouping is of course this very collation of assets
 with vast differences in prices within a single group (cd-player and music
 system for example may have vast differences in prices but could be counted
 as a new electronic asset purchased).
 As our primary intention has been to get the total asset cost we have refrained
 from using such grouping as a primary means of analyses.

The method to smoothen the data on the other hand has clearer advantages.
 As we have noted earlier, in every two years of the survey, the mtm-average
 by the household is susceptible to both how the household interviewee may
 estimate the change in the market and whether the interviewee from the
 household in a particular year is different from the interviewee household
 member in another year.
 The assets data can thus be smoothened by separating the effect of these
 factors if we can consider only only one year's prices.
 To explain this with an example, consider an asset 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 whose value is 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the reported average mtm of the asset at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of assets the household possesses.
 To avoid the measurement error associated with the difference in the estimate
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, we prefer to use the mtm-average estimate (price) at either from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 Therefore the difference in cost of assets

 could be either be 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}P_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t}P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 Choosing the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 however leads us to another issue due to the sparsity of data.
 As we rely on a district-level granularity of data, not only would we not
 have the price reported for an item not owned by the consumer in period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, there may not be enough purchases in the district for us to estimate the
 cost of the item that consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One way to circumvent this is to classify all assets into cheap, middle-range
 and expensive categories based on cost quantiles in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and then determine the category of the asset purchased in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 based on its price in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 The price at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would then by the price of matching category (expensive, middle-range or
 cheap) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Since, we may as well use the price at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, this indirect methods is rendered unnecessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As we're interested in the price for the new purchases (i.e.
 cases such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}>0$
\end_inset

), the prices at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset

) do not suffer with this issue.
 The expenditure on new assets calculated is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Delta n_{a,t+1}=P_{a,t+1}(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 a quantity that considers an mtm change less affected by the measurement
 error in the estimate provided by the household member interviewee.
 In the end, we also plan to confirm the results obtained with a pseudo-panel
 approach.

 and others are provided in the second column of the table.
 The disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$

 is represented with the variable lt1 , assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are represented with At and c.At#c.age represents the interaction between
 the age and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (the c.
 prefix signifies that the interaction is over continuous variables).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical life-cycle consumption patterns can be confirmed with the significan
ce of age-related coefficients.
 More particularly, the quality (excess) consumption seems to decline with
 age while asset purchases do not seem to be influenced by age as much.
 As the disposable income (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

) also depends on the assets soeone owns (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 includes asset-bearing costs) so the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 simulatneously with a weak signifiance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 would imply a signifiance of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that do not have much influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (assets like land which do not less maintenance costs proportional to their
 cost).
 It is see that assets depend negatively on lt1 and quality depends positively
 on lt1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is statistically weak, but the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is significant.
 While more assets purchases are made by those who are already asset-rich
 in relative terms, the new assets purchased are mostly those that are associate
d with high running costs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the distribution of wealth - reflected in the ownership of expensive
 assets such as a house or land - do determine which consumers purchase
 new assets, the significance of disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

 (shown as lt1 in the table) - which we estimate using occupation, education
 and needs over the years 2012 and 2014 - indicates that the new assets
 are purchased by with low 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which is inclusive of assets bearing costs) and/or the new asset purchases
 are by those who have higher income (through better occupation and education).
 Unlike the ownership of asset such as land and housing, disposable income
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 s the sort of wealth that lends to more social mobility.
 The educated or higly-paid may pass on their skills and social networks
 to the progeny, but the transfer of such soft-assets to the next generation
 is more dissipative than the monetary wealth.
 Such might not result in the ownership of more expensive assets (such as
 housing or land) but do require consumption on education and social functions
 anyways.
 The asset purchases may suggest the limits of the asset purchases.
 This is made clearer with the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 for expenditure on quality(
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
) consumption indicates.
 Those with less assets but with better income do seem to spend more on
 quality (including education).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in urban and rural lifestyles indeed also play a role in
 the difference in asset purchases as well as quality - due to the the availabil
ity of electricity being limited to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The assets that are not as expensive as land or housing are more likely
 to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for asset
 purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices in
 the items they depend on the the rural areas for and more likely to deviate
 from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a need to be use some care in interpreting the tobit / OLS results
 using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 - which is a proxy for prices, regional variations, age and the effects
 of wealth.
 To allow our conclusions to be mroe robust, it may be worthwhile to to
 decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 into more control variables possibly by reformulating the model of the
 Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dAt_regression"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 to employ a quantile regression based on age, income, asset costs - while
 still maintaing the key purpse of of the model which is to separate means
 of income from wealth in an analysis of the intermtemporal substitution
 between asset purchases and quality (excess) under a life-cycle setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have argued before, the purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond
 the models for visible consumption.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived risk in one's stability of wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the the participants exihibiting a risk-seeking
 behaviour (i.e.
 a disproportionate expenditure) towards goods and services that may lead
 to a large payoff (immense success) with a small probability (through joining
 golf clubs, engaging in social events - status competitions with a small
 upfront cost).
 This may serve as a refinment to the conventional assumptions of a balance
 between the urban and rural prices in the models that explore rural migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While visible items do capture such a risk-seeking behaviours in the developed
 economies very well, the difference in wealth and the segregation of quality
 of life in the developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they
 may be in segregated societies in the developed economies).
 Without a
\bar under
 
\bar default
consideration of how the assets are distributed in the economy and are subject
 to change, one must be circumspect about arguing for the presence status
 consumption in the developing countries.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic asset possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited to
 the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low asset ownership in an underdeveloped economy, a
 cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be some
 expenditure on clothing .
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considred visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good might be visible enough to the consumers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed this is not to say that the visible consumption does not tell us
 much about the demand in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption - and is worth exploring in its own right - but
 if one were to develop a theory of status consumption instead of revisiting
 visible consumption in varied cultural contexts, the considerations social
 mobility, wealth and asset ownership seem an obvious first step.
 Indeed in the particular case of marraiges, we would only improve our understan
ding of the bride price if we realise that marriages are both an indication
 of one's social status as well as a potential for advancement in social
 ranking - forces that are play in asset purchases much the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the literature on rural and urban differences in the developing
 world should be extended to include status consumption - as the former
 is more general and has stood the test of time.
 The context of status consumption varies significantly across economies
 and one often needs to make adjustments for the particular social conditions
 to draw conclusions on visible consumption.
 However, viewing consumption with an intertemporal behavioural model may
 help us standardise the markets for status in disparate economies and help
 us compare to what extent the consumers engage in status consumption across
 the various economies.
