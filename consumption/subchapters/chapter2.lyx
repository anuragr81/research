\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and Asset Inequality: A comparative study
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
While status consumption is assumed to be ubiquitous, the possibility that
 extreme wealth inequalities in an economy could discourage status comparisons
 across reference groups separated by wealth has been explored less often.
 Comparing non-durable consumption in two sub-Saharan African developing
 economies, we explore the opposing effects of peer influences and extreme
 wealth differences on non-durable consumption.
 Using the LSMS data from Tanzania and Nigeria, we estimate the extent to
 which the non-durable consumption relevant for status indication may be
 segregated by asset ownership levels in the two economies.

Research goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the proposed chapter is to find out whether in an environment
 of wealth disparities, the consumers i) rule out status comparisons beyond
 their immediate reference groups with disparate asset levels (leading to
 status competitions that are essentially non-overlapping) or instead ii)
 substitute being in a poorer reference group (i.e.
 one with less assets) with higher status consumption?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assess the above for given reference boundaries and a distribution of
 assets by comparing the non-durable consumption above needs in Tanzania
 and Nigeria.
 We also comment if in the context of urbanisation-related developments
 in the developing economies, status consumption could be largely an appeal
 for urbanisation in the poorest sections of society.

Studies on visible consumption often explore how expenditures on visible
 items - goods that are not needed except for signaling status - vary among
 consumer populations (see Kaus

).
 In the context of developing economies, we find two issues with this approach.
 First, non-visible consumption could also be indicative of status in a
 population where the majority lives at subsistence level.
 Second, there asset-richness of the consumer's reference may dominate status
 indications in a society with extreme inequalities.
 These effects may be of little significance in the relatively equal societies
 in the developed economies that have stronger institutions for welfare
 and fewer populations at or below levels of subsistence, but they are of
 importance in the context of developing economies where the distribution
 of long-term assets is sparse and the majority of the population struggles
 with addressing basic needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental question that must arise while examining status consumption
 in developing economies is whether status consumption is even meaningful
 or not(see Ustuner et al.

\end_inset

 for a critique of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 view of status consumption).
 While a minority may still consume what one considers status items, it
 is also true that status is hardly on mind of the consumer when the fundamental
 needs are not met.
 As Sen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SenPoorRelativelySpeaking1983"

\end_inset

 puts it, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If there is starvation and hunger, then ...
 the relative picture ...
 has to take a back seat behind the possibly dominating absolutist consideration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 On one hand, as the relative picture is not entirely irrelevant either,
 it makes sense to talk about status consumption for a given sociological
 context but on the other hand, if the relative picture does take a back-seat
 under the absolutist consideration, a general criterion for identifying
 status consumption is more problematic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As evasive as it might be, the role that status goals play in consumption
 is important in assessing the demand in the sub-Saharan African economies
 - particular since they are undergoing fundamental industrial transformations
 and shifts in income distributions.
 As a positive externality with being in a rich neighbourhod has been suggested
 in many surveys of the subjective-welfare in sub-Saharan Africa (see for
 example Astebi et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AstebiCarbonell2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Clark-d'Ambrosio
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ClarkAmbrosioBasicNeedsAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ), there is a rationale for a generic formulation of status consumption
 that considers the role of relative income and can be used across multiple
 economies in the region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental issue with such a generic formulation is lack of a generalised
 notion of a consumer's social needs - an issue that has been a sticking
 point in the discussions on poverty measurement (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and Sen

key "SenRejoinderTownsend1985"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 More particularly, whether a status good is purchased by a household due
 to a social pressure felt by its household members or because of their
 will to indicate a perceived higher status through consumption is rather
 impossible to determine unless one conducts direct interviews probing that
 intent.
 Unless one tracks the motivations for the goods purchased in a comparative
 study of status consumption, the ideas of invidious comparison and pecuniary
 emulation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bagwell_veblen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are of little descriptive significance.
 As an example, consider dowry and wedding expenditures - which are evident
 instances of conspicuous consumption (see Bloch et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BlochRaoDesaiIndiaMarriage"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 While it makes sense to talk about status consumption in the respective
 contexts of each economy where they are observed, a lack of clarity on
 whether dowry is a necessity for a general household (whether it is in
 Tanzania, India or Nigeria) or is a means of indicating wealth (e.g.
 by endowing financial prowess to the newly wedded couple) in the economy
 hinders a comparison of similar expenditure on status consumption in the
 respective economies.
 Unless one can argue for a wider sociological context applicable to the
 economies under comparison, the lack of a generic notion of necessity across
 cultural contexts makes the ideas of wastefulness in consumption rather
 flimsy.
 In order to compare the demand for status consumption across the two developing
 economies, therefore, one needs to specify and measure a generic notion
 of status consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having been a perplexing issue in the literature on poverty, the notion
 of social needs does often consider the role of social perceptions (context)
 in determination of individual needs (see for example the Mack-Lansley
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MacLansleyPoorBriain1985"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 view of poverty as the socially enforced minimum consumption level).
 This is very much a compromise between the two extremes - one where the
 treatment of subjective welfare is used to arrive at a level of social
 needs (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "townsendpoverty1979"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and the other the researcher's value judgment decides the idea of a

).
 The issue does not ameliorate when determining the social needs for the
 purpose of measuring status consumption.
 While the poverty line is a lowest bound (minimum) of necessary consumption,
 the definition of status needs requires the identification of a highest
 bound of necessary level of consumption.
 In other words, much the way poverty is defined at the level below which
 needs are definitely unmet for all consumers (qualifying them to be poor
 or dysfunctional), status consumption depends on an uppermost bound of
 necessary consumption so that the consumption below the level is considered
 necessary and all spending above the level is deemed status-related or
 wasteful.
 Such notions must extend to multiple dimensions as well - so that just
 the way a household can be said to suffer with health poverty but not food
 poverty, it could be gifted with status through education but cursed with
 no-status through housing and so forth (see for example Charles et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CharlesHurstRace"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where housing-related consumption is ignored for the base level of status
 consumption).
 Needless to say, the idea that the rich really need a luxury item to go
 on with their daily lives is far more problematic than the argument for
 treating unmet social needs of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 as poverty (or indeed the free-rider concern of the poor forgoing

\end_inset

 necessities to spend on frivolities
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MacLansleyPoorBriain1985"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The compromise arrived at in the discussion of poverty has been that our
 question of whether the consumer's private subjective welfare qualifies
 are necessary for her or not is different from question of values i.e.
 how much she should be spending on certain needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As problematic as it might seem to pin down a threshold level of consumption
 above which the consumer becomes wasteful, an upper threshold of necessity
 is what is implied by the classification of status goods.
 This threshold is what one sets implicitly by identifying a given set of
 status items.
 The appeal or utility from the status item implies that the consumer who
 purchases the item obtains or indicates some status while the consumer
 with no possession of the (any) status item (or a certain quantity of a
 less scarce status items) is meant to have minded her necessities.
 This sharp threshold implied by the classification of status goods still
 works fine as long as either the consumers of status goods are already
 a high status group or if the utility from status goods is strictly separable
 from all other utilities which the consumers are concerned with.
 Either of these conditions would ensure that having a status good pushes
 one's consumption above the upper necessity limit.
 The latter condition of separability has been used widely in the literature
 on visible (conspicuous) consumption as it treats private (non-visible)
 utilities separable from public (visible) utilities.
 Since Veblen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "VeblenLeisureClass"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 himself viewed status items as necessarily futile, the consideration of
 conspicuous consumption justifies this separability.
 In the more general setting for a cross-country comparison with limited
 price details of commodity groups (food, energy, household etc.) and quantities
 consumed, however, the identification of an upper-bound threshold consumption
 level is less trivial.

%The problem is also that one might not deny that certain cultural contexts

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To err on the side of caution, we consider no explicit upper limit for necessary
 consumption in a generic consideration of consumption towards status.
 Instead, we consider a model for status where it is indicated by both richness
 of one's reference and the consumption above the minimum level of needs.
 All consumption above a minimum needs-level of non-durable consumption
 is thus of potential status value.
 This follows the suggestion that status is not a goal in itself but implied
 by other micro-status goals in a society (see Congleton
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CONGLETONStatusGames1989175"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 More specifically, the status of the consumer is constituted both in the
 non-durable consumption above the level of needs and the asset-richness
 of the reference she identifies with.
 The general definition of status consumption we seek across cultural context
 is thus a standardised one where all consumption above the biological and
 asset-level needs is of potential status value.
 This is hardly problematic in the context of a developing economy where
 the fundamental needs are not met for a significant population and the
 consumption above the minimum consumption is all the status that may be
 implied through consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status is thus shaped by two components.
 The first is the stable component that stays unchanged in the short-term
 and includes long-established states e.g.
 education, occupation, ancestral social roles leading to asset-richness
 of the consumer's reference.
 The second - which we refer to as simply 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - is the consumption that countervails the wide differences created by
 the first component.
 Instead of a culture-specific view of status consumption (such as dowry,
 jewelry, designer clothes etc.), this view of status consumption subjects
 the consumers across disparate cultural contexts to constraints of asset
 acquisition.
 The dowry in the developing economy or a designer suit in the developed
 world can both be seen as either serving as non-durable consumption above
 needs in this view of status consumption.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the above definition we turn to answering whether the consumers compensate
 with or ignore the competitive status consumption across the reference
 groups differentiated by levels asset-ownership.
 While the above consideration circumvents the search for a maximum bound
 of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption level - considering only that a more decent standard of living
 would carry more status than a fairly decent standard of living - it suffices
 for the specific question of how status consumption varies across reference
 levels.
 Regardless of whether richer references - due to having higher asset ownership
 - have higher above-minimum needs or status indication tendencies, their
 consumption above asset-imposed needs is considered an instance of status
 consumption in the above formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical determination of asset-imposed needs uses the costs related
 to assets in the consumption diary (e.g.
 petrol, repair etc.) while the minimal basic-needs level is determined using
 the average per-head consumption of the households that have run out of
 food in the district where the consumer resides.
 A localised and standardised price-dependent minimal consumption is key
 to the notion of status consumption - since no consumption below the minimal
 level is considered of any status advantage.
 Any expenditure towards maintenance, repair or subscription (rental etc.)
 of assets owned by the consumer are considered as needs implied by the
 asset-richness one has achieved and is also excluded from status consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assets owned by the consumer also aggregated into to the richness of
 the reference group which the consumer belongs to.
 These reference groups - defined with the immediate surroundings of the
 consumer - are meant to regulate the excess (net non-durable consumption
 in excess of needs).
 We can thus ask whether the richer consumers reduce the excess consumption
 above needs or not.
 The notion of asset-richness also provides us an idea of how polarised
 the status competitions in the reference groups may be.
 More particularly, extremely rich reference groups might have a completely
 different status consumption from those that are much poorer in asset-terms.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% This means that reference education is what needs to be in the main equation
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (those with higher asses may spend systematically less or more on the non-durab
le consumption excluding asset costs).
 Such a polarisation (e.g.
 with assets being concentrated into a few regions) could lead to a segregation
 of status competitions so that the consumers in poorer regions never enter
 into a status comparison with the richer regions.
 Likewise, relatively equal distribution of long-term assets could result
 in a higher appeal to status consumption.
 We refer to the situation when both asset differences and status consumption
 are so far apart that there can be no status competition between the asset-rich
 and asset-poor as that of a separated status consumption.
 The empirical question thus boils down to testing whether there is a separation
 in the identified reference groups or not.
 Since status consumption is less prominent when separated, it allows us
 to comment whether status consumption could be considered relevant in an
 economy or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above outline of a model necessitates a reference dependent utility
 from status consumption.
 To explain this with an example, consider the choice faced by a consumer
 with a given income to move to a richer area where the asset-possession
 is higher.
 If the choice isn't lucrative - it need not be only due to higher prices
 for the same level of needs observed in the richer area (pricier lifestyle
 choices) - but also because the poorer reference may provide a better social
 positioning to the consumer.
 In other words, the consumer could prefer to maintain her social positioning
 in the poorer reference instead of being positioned lower in the richer
 area.
 The utility from the same level of status consumption is therefore inextricably
 tied with the reference.
 Further, if both the richer and the poorer areas are under the same market
 of status-indicating item, then one would expect a strong demand for status
 items in the poorer area despite asset differences.
 On the other hand, if the differences in assets are extreme and/or the
 status markets are already segregated, the consumer may either see the
 local relative social positioning rather meaningless and choose to be at
 slight positioning disadvantage in the richer area or not worry about changing
 her status consumption in the richer area at all if she is content in the
 poorer area
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that the presence of separation of status consumption - which both
 spurs local status competitions and discourages competitions at a wider
 level - depends very much on the particular reference boundaries.
 All inferences related to separation are therefore to be drawn based on
 a particular reference level.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the econometric analysis that follows, we examine how the income increments
 relate with the price (per-head average) of status consumption and the
 asset-richness in the reference.
 A higher 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

price
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means a more expensive status consumption and high richness means more
 expensive assets.
 A comparison of the effect of total expenditure and reference-averages
 of status-consumption allows us to explain if given a certain income, the
 consumer is likely to spend it staying away from the minimum-level in the
 lower prices environment or be relatively poor in the higher assets reference.
 In a comparison of two economies, we explain both how status consumption
 differs across economies and if the differences in assets may create a
 separation across regions.
 The food component of non-durable consumption is compared with the non-food
 component to comment on the role that the level of urbanisation might play
 in the two economies.

A necessary condition for the adoption of the consumer demand framework
 is however that status must undergo a change in response to consumption.

 be any utility from status-consumption in the short-run when status is
 accumulated only over the long-term.
 The paradox is resolved trivially when status is subjected to change with
 consumption - much the way it is shaped by income or education in the long-term.

The identification of status goods - which would allow the use of the consumer
 demand framework - often needs to be adapted in the context a developing
 economy where most consumers may live at the subsistence level.
 On one hand, conspicuous consumption is meant to be the consumption above
 one's needs, but its relevance means that it should be observed for a significa
nt part of the population across all sections of an economy.
 Since social needs pertaining to status consumption are realised from within
 a localised reference, it is often possible to demarcate certain status
 items based on sociological observations relevant to a particular economy
 - an approach that is followed in much of the literature on conspicuous
 consumption we have surveyed.
 However, a comparison of status consumption across economies (e.g.
 Tanzania and Nigeria) requires us to have a standardised notion of status
 consumption that can be interpreted in the economies compared.

), the limitations of the context do become the limitations of a comparative
 study.
 The chapter is intended to fill this gap using a standardised criteria
 by observing how the distribution of assets in an economy relates to the
 interplay between the long-term notions of status and immediate consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key feature of the above standardised criterion is that it circumvents
 the issue of a boundary of wastefulness across the economies being compared.
 The boundary - which treats the consumption above the limit of necessity
 as wasteful - is hardly an issue in the discussion of status consumption
 in developed economies where the basic needs have largely been fulfilled
 (see Hirsch

).
 But when needs are largely unfulfilled in a population, the fulfillment
 of needs as well as the ownership of sparsely distributed (and evidently
 visible) assets must also carry some status for the consumers.
 To consider status in a developing economy, we therefore consider a model
 for status where both non-durable consumption in excess of one's needs
 and the long-term characteristics including assets account for status.
 Thus while the fulfillment of basic needs itself does not offer an advantage
 to the consumer in a status competition, a consumer with the habit of

excess would

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The above approach to record all consumption in excess of one's needs towards
 status is essentially a middle path between two extremes in the literature
 - the first where one must rely only on subjective preferences (i.e.
 the Townsend view
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991,townsendpoverty1979"

\end_inset

) and the second where a particular absolutist view may supersede subjective
 wants (see Sen
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "SenRelPoor"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 By not using the upper limit for wastefulness, we limit the scope of a
 value judgment which is inherent in declaring what items constitute wasteful
 consumption in the respective economies.
 The common assumption which sets the lower bound for consumption in the
 measure of status consumption for the respective economies is that the
 households having run out of food faces needs that were unavoidable.
 The question of whether the household has run out of food is common in
 the surveys in both the economies and relies on the consumer reported inability
 rather than a notion of biological needs.
 This is aligned with the Doyal-Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DoyalGoughNeeds1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 approach that interprets needs in terms of health and autonomy - requirements
 not meeting which would lead to a definite harm.
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite - ruling out
 the starch diet as one that might fulfill the set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

basic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dietary needs.
 If a household runs out of food while consuming more than just a basic
 diet of starch (for bare survival), then her food consumption is still
 considered minimal using our approach - no consumption at or below it would
 be count towards status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The base-level level of needs - above which the excess is recorded - includes
 the needs implied by the assets one owns (land, housing, agricultural assets
 etc.) as well.
 All expenses such as the maintenance fees, subscription services etc.
 are associated with the owned assets and count towards needs of the consumer.
 The assets thus contribute to both the richness of the consumer's reference
 (in turn corresponding to a certain level of status) and the needs of the
 consumer.
 To recap, identifying the minimal food consumption as the lower limit of
 necessary consumption does not mean that we consider all consumption above
 the level as wasteful.
 Instead, we argue only that any consumption below the minimal food consumption
 is unlikely to provide any status benefit - which is derived both through
 (all) consumption above the sum of food security costs and the asset-related
 costs.
 The relatively rich may feel a higher level of what they consider decent
 level of needs but our goal is only to understand how the richness of consumers
' reference groups - which accounts for all peer effects or a sense of external
 needs - compares with their observed consumption above needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The appeal for status consumption necessarily implies a substitution for
 the consumer allowing her to choose between being in a poorer reference
 (in terms of asset) with a further distance from the minimal level consumption
 and being in a richer reference with a

 is essentially a way to proxy the role of the reference group which the
 consumer identifies with.

 in other ways), one may need to account for a certain visible item being
 irrelevant for the other reference groups.

 If such a separation exists, one cannot argue that the status consumption

Since the consumption below the minimum needs (food security) level of consumpti

 us to have a selection approach - given that there are a significant number

 the households that have run out of food in the past year.
 As the factors that affect consumer household's poverty are not necessarily
 the same that increase the excess non-durable consumption, we use a Heckman

 The notion of a reference group relevant to status is key to our understanding

[The right A-aggregation level] As argued in the previous section, all expenditu
re in the excess of a minimal set of needs is of potential status value
 in the model - and helps the consumer overcome the inequalities implied
 by the long-term assets and demographic characteristics of the household.
 While it is possible to use the intertemporal framework to compare asset
 acquisition with our notion of status consumption(see the discussion of
 Macawber threshold

 which may prevent consumers from savings towards assets), the scope for
 measurement of substitution of savings with spending on status items is
 limited in our dataset set due to the relatively short span (between 2010
 and 2015) of the survey - which is more suited for a cross-sectional analysis
 of how the distribution of assets influences the status benefits from consumpti
on.
 The representative consumer in the model therefore obtains utility from
 assets relevant to status only through the references created by the asset
 ownership rather than directly through the assets she owns.
 The utility being reference dependent also implies that for the same non-durabl
e consumption level, the consumer in a poorer reference may get different
 utility the consumer in a richer asset-reference.
 A key concern for the model is therefore how we defin the consumer's neighborho

 for comparison.

[log(A)] The simplest case for this aggregation is the degenerate case of
 not having an aggregation by letting every asset ownership value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 for each household act as a reference so that the consumer is only concerned
 with whether her excess consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is commensurate with the level of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 she possesses or not.
 The status needs are therefore strongly tied to the level of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 owned by the household.
 Given the total consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the household, higher assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 are likely to have a lower excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 (due to higher savings rate and higher costs of maintaining assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

) and imply a diminishing returns from excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 A simple substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 follows so that consumers with slightly lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 could either spend more on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 as they do not have much 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 or spend less on

 if they too far away from the successive level of

[Granularity] The key issue with the degenerate case is that the substitution
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 and

 is hardly that strong.
 This is because in the context of status, one cannot avail higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 with increased higher quality of consumption or status goods after one
 point without acquiring more assets.
 For example, a consumer could improve quality in housing by accumulating
 appliances and decorations - but one would require a larger home for improvemen
t of quality (and the status implications through it) after one point.
 Unlike liquidity constraints, status-needs are eventually reference-bound
 - thus we expand the notion of the reference beyond the degenerate case
 of individual asset acquisition levels.
 In particularly, we present the references at the local (enumeration area)
 level and a wider geographical level (~15 
\begin_inset Formula $km^{2}$
\end_inset

 The empirical goal is to test if poorer references (populations with lower

 a higher deviation from minimal

 The richness

[Minimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - hunger definition] The minimal level of non-durable consumption in the
 survey is based on the average consumption on food of the households that
 have run out of food in the past 12 months (from the time of the survey).
 The underlying argument is that with food as a bare necessity, a household
 would not compromise on food needs to avail higher quality elsewhere.
 Any per-head consumption below the average per-head consumption of the
 households having run out food would be considered below or at the minimal
 necessary consumption level.
 We thus record a non-zero 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 only when the household consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i,t}$
\end_inset

 is higher than the minimal consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i,t}=\xi_{i,t}\psi_{i,t}^{*}$
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{i,t}$
\end_inset

 is the number of family members in the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i,t}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the minimal per-head household consumption (the average of the per-head
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{c_{j.t}}{\xi_{j,t}}$
\end_inset

 of the households 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in the relevant area that have run out of food at least once in the past
 12 months) .
 The non-durable consumption counted towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 also excludes the asset-maintenance costs so that given the consumption
 budget 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i,t}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{i,t}$
\end_inset

 and minimal consumption

 The above equation states that once needs for minimum food consumption
 are met, the representative household must first pay the costs that are
 imposed on her due to owning a certain level of long-term assets (and thereby
 being in the particular asset-reference group of richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) before she may indicate any status through non-durable consumption.
 Once a level of needs fixed for a household - assumed to vary only with
 the number of household members and their age - there are the only two
 ways in which a consumer can achieve status - either by increasing her
 asset ownership or improving her non-durable consumption excluding costs

 In other words, the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 i.e.
 the non-durable consumption above minimal food security level after excluding
 cost of assets levied from asset-ownership encompasses all status consumption
 there can be.
 The reference-dependent utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{i,t}$
\end_inset

 means that consumer in a richer asset-ownership reference would only be
 concerned with the level of non-durable consumption (excluding asset-maintenanc
e costs) within her own reference rather than with the level in the poorer
 reference where either or both of non-durable consumption and asset-ownership
 could be lower.
 Since the model does not track changes in assets over time, a household
 competes only with non-durable (status) consumption within her reference.

% What's not clear is the reason why we are ignoring A on the RHS.
 We're saying that individual consumption levels of non-durable consumption
 should be related to average non-durable consumption and overall assets.
 Using an XT model, one can check whether consumers respond to changes in
 asset values in the area or change in net non-durable consumption (or in
 all consumption).
 A comparison of all consumption vs all non-durable consumption in XT model
 is unnecessary because we assume a cost-structure Psi(r)- suggesting that
 asset-costs are already considered with assets.
 The theoretical justification of the averages are that they are prices
 - of needs (whether basic-food or all-food depends on the availability
 of non-foods prices and the measurement erros by mixing) of asset-maintenance.
 The substitution between asset-costs, needs and nde can be considered -
 so the averages of assets (the role of r), price of needs (average food)
 and (average nde) can then be considered.
 Without AIDS, we can just take q_nde as dependent variable and then consider
 prices (averages) as independent variables.
 Care should be taken on how this corresponds to the model stated in the
 chapter.
 The average of basic-needs + asset costs makes sense, but then we need
 to explain that r_t (price of richness) comprises both of an average needs
 (price) component and an average assets (price) component.
 This also explains that logx - which is not an average and an individual
 value - must remain as independent variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% So in summary, the only substitution we want to present is between nu
 and r_t.
 If we were to use AIDS (let's say), then the weight would be of total asset-cos
ts and nde (not needs).
 The total costs we care about is therefore also just the sum of asset_costs
 (energy, transport) and nu (food, household).
 instead of asset-cost averages we use asset-price-averages and instead
 of price of food+household - we use the total price of food+household (thats'
 the average nde).

Non-durable consumption Excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption items in the LSMS survey are classified under four broad
 categories - food, energy, transport and household.
 Since all consumption related to energy and transport are contingent on
 owning an asset related to energy or transport, we consider the expenditure
 on energy and transport as costs of maintaining a certain level of assets
 (car, refrigerator, heater etc.).
 The expenditure on food and household consumption is all that contributes
 to non-durable consumption excluding asset costs.
 This classification of expenditures is presented in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 for Tanzania and in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{itemsclassification_ngr}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for Nigeria.
 Since a consumer achieves utility both from being in a certain asset-reference
 and excess, this treatment of asset-bearing costs within non-durable consumptio
n (e.g.
 energy- and transport-related costs) is merely to avoid of double-counting
 of the role of assets in status comparisons.
 Consider for example the comparison of statuses for two consumers of which
 only one owns a motorcycle.
 Here, in the comparison of non-durable consumption, we do not need to compare
 how much petrol they've purchased when we've already taken into account
 the difference in their transportation-related asset(s) (i.e.
 having a motorcycle vs not having a motorcycle).
 Therefore, since energy and transport related assets are already considered
 as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer, the costs associated with energy and transport are excluded
 from the notion of non-durable consumption relevant for signaling.
 The only non-food relevant expenditure for status that we measure as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 comes from household category - thus excluding the costs implied by the
 assets owned by the consumer (see Table

 is the non-durable consumption excluding asset costs and the minimal the
 food consumption in the consumer's district - is recorded as a non-zero
 value only if the consumption excluding asset costs is above the minimum
 food level.
 However, since the households that run out of food are more likely to be
 those with larger families, we would be overestimating the needs of the
 smaller households if we consider the total consumption of the household
 as the criteria for determining excess.
 Therefore, the minimum level is identified using the per-head expenditure
 - so that the food needs of the family of the household are 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi\times\overline{c}_{outoffood}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{c}_{outoffood}$

 This corresponds to the unit-value method for prices used in the consumer

 We denote these averages as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t}),p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$

 The durable goods recorded in the LSMS survey range from short-term durable
 items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such
 as land or houses.
 Of these, we are interested only in the long-term assets that can be transferre

 The assets transferred over a generation are readily verified by inspecting
 households in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit
 family starts a new household.
 We note that only items that are furniture related or costlier than furniture
 are transferred over generations in both Tanzania and Nigeria.

\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current

 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value

 Partly to avoid the absence of rural-urban fields corresponding to the

 We have not however obtained significant differences in the results with

 This could be both because of the coarse granularity of our reference boundarie

Empirical Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of our empirical analysis is to find the extent to which the non-durabl
e expenditure excluding asset costs is separated by local asset-ownership.
 Equipped with a generic notion of status consumption, we evaluate this
 for both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 In either of the economies, if only asset-levels influenced the excess
 non-durable consumption level, then a segregation of non-durable consumption
 based on asset-richness is implied.
 If on the other hand, the effect of asset-richness on excess is weak compared
 to the the local averages of non-durable consumption, the non-durable consumpti
on is likely more dominant (and less separation).
 Following the same arguments, when neither the local non-durable consumption
 averages nor the local asset-averages are significant for the individual's
 consumption after accounting for income, excess is predominantly driven
 by the income of the individual and the different clusters of income and
 assets are spread uniformly across the regions (over which we calculated
 local averages).
 Lastly, when excess non-durable consumption is influenced both by local
 asset-averages and local-non-durable consumption averages in the local
 areas then the non-durable consumption patterns are clustered both according
 to levels of asset and regional costs of non-durable consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the non-durable consumption excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 includes both food and non-food components.
 As we have argued earlier, the non-durable consumption above the minimum
 level of needs is considered towards status in the current approach.
 This also supports the wide-ranging evidence for pressures on food-quality
 in sub-Saharan countries (see for example Schneider et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MastersMalawiFoodQuality2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the needs for food quality are not met for the majority of a population,
 social interactions are likely to reveal consumers who can afford better
 food quality from those who can't.
 The attainment of higher food quality would - in other words - be visible
 enough in a poor economy and should be considered a part of non-durable
 consumption relevant for status.

 The selection argument is essentially that the consumers being poor creates
 a bias towards spending on status consumption and a selection equation
 accounts for the factors that contribute to consumer's poverty but not
 as much the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The liquidity constraints the consumer faces influence the private assets
 stock rather than the reference-level richness and status pressures.

 consumption - whereas the reference level means

 As explained earlier, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not include the cost of owning and maintaining assets since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 already includes the contribution of assets to one's status.
 As a consumer does not choose the maintenance of assets separately from
 choosing to purchase the asset, the idea that a representative consumer
 increases her non-durable consumption above needs excluding the asset costs
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 by availing a higher quality or quantity than necessary makes sense only
 if we exclude the costs imposed on the consumer due to having bought certain
 assets (through maintenance, repair, fees etc.) from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The average 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 thus also excludes the cost of maintaining assets (food expenditures don't
 include cost associated with assets to begin with).

[Restating the question] We want to see if the consumers respond to their
 local ea or district, or they are separated by disparities in the ea or
 districts.
 The effect of relative income would be higher in urban areas - no doubt.
 But how does the quality consumption vary for the consumers across poverty.
 Do consumers increase consumption due to being in a rich area or do they
 compensate by being in a poorer region (so that poorer regions/localities
 show a higher ndc).
 Does asset polarisation i.e.
 separation tell us more? Distance from market could tell us something but
 we're looking at measures of isolation depending on assets.
 Is separation matters, then a more polarised population should show less
 (does polarisation vary in tanzania and nigeria)

A non-parametric view
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the overall poverty levels may be similar in Nigeria and Tanzania,
 the extreme differences in Tanzania (particularly between the south of
 the country and the east) are in contrast with those in Nigeria.
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 In Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) , on the other hand, the income-disparities in occupations and asset-differenc
es seem less extreme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The range of occupations available to the consumer populations in the surveys
 from Tanzania and Nigeria are varied.
 To compare the role of occupations in the two economies, we standardise
 all the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria into
 occupation ranks ranging from 0 to 3.
 The occupation ranks are essentially based on sorting the varied occupations
 in the two economies by the income of consumers in the respective countries.
 The occupation-ranks mapped from the occupation levels in Tanzania and
 Nigeria are presented in Table

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AlesinaMobilityAfrica2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this the sparsity of income data.
 In the LSMS data used for Nigeria and Tanzania, the income data is not
 available for the entire survey population.
 This is partly due to significant informal sectors in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{education_rank_tnz}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for Tanzania and Table

 for Nigeria).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regional disparities in economic conditions and population density provide
 a particular context to status differences in the economy - as the disparity
 in services as well as amenities across the country have strong implications
 for any consumption deemed status-related.
 A key interpretation of our model for status consumption is that status
 competitions are essentially non-overlapping between two groups of consumers
 when one has both extremely low asset-levels compared to the other and
 extremely low non-durable consumption levels as well.
 In other words, a consumer cannot be in a status competition with another
 consumer when she has both lower level of asset-richness and inferior (or
 deficient) non-durable consumption as well.
 With the south of Tanzania not having nearly the same level of electricity
 consumption nor comparable durable goods associated with electricity as
 the east of Tanzania, the non-durable consumption from the consumers in
 south of Tanzania is hardly in reference to the consumers in urban east
 of Tanzania.
 We use the parametric analysis to test for this effect in Tanzania and
 Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status concerns are necessarily localised, the non-durable consumption
 for consumers in the asset poor south and west are indeed much lower.
 On the other hand, despite lower incomes in the central north, the median
 net-asset worth of the individuals in regions such as Singida and Manyara
 could match up with that of the consumers in the east coast of Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 With the average asset-values and food average costs relatively more aligned
 in the central and eastern regions, the occupational/asset differences
 and non-durable consumption are more comparable between the two regions
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In Tanzania, where we have data on subjective well-being for individuals,
 we also find that eastern regions have much higher perceptions and non-durable
 consumption excluding asset costs as well as high value of assets compared
 to central areas.
 Still, the consumers in southern regions have relatively higher reported
 satisfaction levels than the centre.
 While poverty may not influence subjective well-being so much in Tanzania,
 it cannot be ruled out that the poor are not in the same status competition
 as the rich.
 Not having a similar detail for Nigeria in the LSMS survey prevents us
 from comparing subjective well being data in the two economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the regional disparities, they appear less extreme in Nigeria even
 though the southern areas of the country seem to have more higher-paid
 occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Despite the differences in educational and occupational levels in between
 the north and south of the country, the disparity in asset ownership is
 not nearly as extreme as in Tanzania.
 The implications of this uniformity on non-durable consumption is discussed
 using a parametric approach in the Section

 This view of status has two key implications if there are no reported assets
 for a vast majority of the population - first, that the status competitions
 are simply not feasible between two groups if they are separated by region
 or social barriers leading to extreme asset differences.
 Second, non-durable consumption (including food) might carry locally relevant
 status supported by comparisons among consumers with no-reported assets.
 As the extreme differences in assets - be it through social or geographical
 barriers - imply differentiated social contexts, the status competitions
 among consumer groups where extreme asset differences exist would undergo
 a separation of reference groups - that we have set ourselves to measure

The issue of granularity is key in our interpreations.
 While urban settings would always have higher assets and higher non-durable
 consumption opportunities overall, the cross-country comparison on a similar
 granularity based on poppulation and geographical area quantiies the effect
 of extreme assets-differences on status consumption

 on the subjective well-being data that rural areas show a higher life satisfact

 For financial satisfcation, this effect is less pronounced (also reported

.
 Asset bands provide us the needed reference-point which we use to argue
 for the presence of a segregation in competitions when asset-differences
 are wide.
 While status competition are evidently more predominant in cities (developing
 and developed economies alike), the urban-rural differences in assets are
 less extreme in the developed economies and a substitution between owning
 assets and non-durable consumption more evident.
 Our model quantifies how this changes in developing economies where there
 is a significant number of households at subsistence level with very little
 asset possessions.
 The extreme differences in urban and rural areas leading to such a segmentation
 of habits must appear as a higher significance of local-level asset-possession
 on one's non-durable consumption excluding assets costs.

[Polarisation and Separation] Extreme asset differences themselves tell
 us that status consumption is going to be different.
 Does non-food being less controlled by assets tell us something about the
 extreme differences in Tanzania? This would need to be implied - at least
 intuitively - with the polarisation measures (this polarisation depends
 on identification between groups - to consider that in the current analysis
 we'll have to assume that there are no ethnic groupings and that asset-groups
 themselves are all that control the identification as well as antagonism.
 If we argue that consumers care about immediate reference and not about
 the reference richer than them, then we would experience lower status consumpti
on i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the same 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 when polarisation is higher.
 In this case, we would look for a significance for polarisation.
 High polarisation and high status consumption would mean that consumers
 do care about references more.
 This can be compared across TNZ and NGR.

% We have used the LS measure before to see whether w_i is driven by LS
 or not.
 We can see how the overall polarisation measures of assets are sensitive
 rather than the entire log(A).
 Our question is whether consumers compete with those with higher than the
 refernece or not - thus a higher or lower cluster could be more clearly
 identified by considering first whether assets are or less polarised in
 TNZ vs NGR.
 In terms of regression, nothing changes except that instead of log(A) we
 look for asset polarisation dummies or instead of prices we look for consumptio
n polarised dummies.

] Therefore we compare both the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 itself in the two countries and evaluated how extreme asset differences
 and the regional barriers causing scarcities may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the two economies.
 While a significant population in both the economies spends a larger budget
 share on food, the overall non-durable consumption is largely comparable
 for Tanzania and Nigeria.
 However, we also find that the more uniformly distributed assets in Nigeria
 imply that long-term asset ownership has a more significant role towards
 status (in Nigeria).
 More non-durable comprises of non-food component in Nigeria than in Tanzania
 and the food quality seems more segregated across rural and urban regions
 in Tanzania than in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[List of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

] The substitution between having more assets and having high non-durable
 consumption is higher in Nigeria - where the younger consumers seem to
 acquire assets over years and reduce non-durable consumption excluding
 asset-costs as they grow older and/or richer.
 In Tanzania, on the other hand, the substitution between owning assets
 and non-durable consumption is limited.
 That the needs don't scale up non-durable consumption as much in Tanzania
 suggests a squeeze on the total non-durable expenditures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[List of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

] Similarly, while the differences in non-durable consumption between medium
 occupations and low occupations is relatively less in both the economies
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is higher for highest occupations for both Nigeria and Tanzania), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is also more sensitive to asset-accumulation in Tanzania.
 The extreme differences in wealth imply a less overlapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and therefore a more segmented status competition in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Summary] Two takeaways: the effect extreme asset-differences in a developing
 economy too often come with significant differences in non-durable consumption
 as well - underpinning a separation  of demand for non-durable consumption
 above needs that may indicate status.
 We find i) that the extreme differences do limit status consumption and
 ii) that the sense of status in the developing economies is incomplete
 without the consideration of differences in long-term asset possessions.

% It is worth emphasising however that above conclusions are drawn for a
 given level of granularity of aggregation.
 The income and occupation differences within groups finer than the district
 level aggregation might show more detailed variation in 
\backslash
nu_{t} consumption across income levels but our interpretations with district-le
vel aggregations have been concerned with the effect of wider regional dispariti
es on status consumption in the economies.
 We have used the measure r_{t} to consider the effect of urban and rural
 disparities on non-durable consumption since we find the extreme urban-rural
 differences more relevant to status competitions in the developing economies
 than the consumption visible goods which are limited to a small urban populatio
n.

 Interpretations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 1.
 C5 says that higher price-non-food-expenditure suppresses w_food (individuals
 would decrease w_food when there is higher non-food area - so they move
 together with the food consumption).
 higher-price-food-expenditure on the other hand increases food weight (meaning
 consumers run to food when prices are higher).
 C6 suggests that consumers run to food more easily in TNZ - thus indicating
 more non-durable consumption in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 2.
 C3 says that older households have higher food consumption.
 C7 means that bigger households tend to have lower w_food than smaller
 households.
 Younger households have less w_food - meaning more non-durable consumption
 among younger people in both countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 3.
 D5 says high-food-expenditure-regions have lower non-durable consumption
 (again because food is more important).
 D5 also says that high-non-food-expenditure regions have a positive influence
 so the consumption does move together for non-food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 4.
 D2 says that asset-differences have a -ve influence on w_nonfood.
 Richer areas suppress non-food expenditure a lot in Tanzania.
 Urban areas actually push people to food.
