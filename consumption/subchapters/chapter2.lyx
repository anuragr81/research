\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and intertemporal substitution - the effect of regional
 variations on status consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role of wealth inequalities
 in status consumption is less understood in the varied contexts of developing
 countries.
 We develop a model for status consumption based on the intertemporal consumer
 choice where status is viewed as part of the consumer's utility.
 The utility function used in the model comprises of both quality in non-durable
 consumption and owned durable goods.
 Using the data on durable goods ownership available in the Tanzanian LSMS
 consumption microdata, we discuss how a segregation of quality may characterise
 status consumption in a developing economy..

.
 If status consumption were to exist everywhere, one would expect that regardles
s of how poor an economy is, the consumers would maintain a consumption
 level relative to their reference group level.
 However, since reference groups themselves are subject to spatial and economic
 boundaries, a disproportionate demand for signaling-goods (i.e.
 conspicuous consumption) in an economy would depend on the extent to which
 much the social reference groups are segmented across the population.
 It is thus possible that the demand for a certain conspicuous goods (not
 commodities) is completely absent in some reference groups

 One cannot expect - in other words - that the poor majority in a largely

 Germany after the economic liberalisation at the end of cold war to test
 if prolonged measures of suppressed incomes can influence visible consumption
 when the incomes rise with economic changes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the relationship between status consumption and poverty levels has only
 partly been explored in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In studying the issue of separated social reference groups, we have adopted
 an approach slightly different from the studies in conspicuous consumption.
 Instead of focusing on visible consumption, we view status consumption
 as a combination of expensive durable goods and high-quality non-durable
 consumption.
 We then compare the combined effect of the two on consumers that are spread
 across different age-groups and levels of urbanisation.
 Using an intertemporal substitution framework with life-cycle effects,
 we attempt to endogenise the role of personal characteristics (such as
 social class, level of education) which may influence status directly or
 through access to long-term durable goods (which in turn influence status).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model for status competition with owned long-term goods and consumption
 of quality is based on a social-deference view of status that has been
 embraced in many economic studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KoutsobinasStatusPoliticalEconomy,corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The key argument is that if the role of status consumption is to influence
 a ranking of income and/or wealth, it follows that the status for two consumers
 with same personal characteristics and a fixed set of needs can only compete
 with either quality in non-durable consumption or ownership of long-term
 durable goods.

The sense of quality in the conventional demand analyses is often interpreted
 from an aggregation of items over commodities as separable groups

The theoretical requirements for such an aggregation require a detailed
 set of market prices of goods within every commodity

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detailed market prices are seldom available in a typical consumption
 survey - and issue that is often circumvented by focusing on visible consumptio
n - a particular instance of status consumption that is meant to be futile
 for except for signaling purposes.
 The futility of status goods also ensures the separability of demand for
 visible goods - while viewing a narrowed context of quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that the futility assumption cannot be made in severely unequal
 societies where wealth differences may be far too wide to be narrowed with
 visible (or high quality) non-durable consumption.
 As status consumption comprises both of quality across commodities and
 ownership of durable goods, the contribution of durable goods to the ranking
 order might dominate any changes with visible (high quality) non-durable
 consumption.
 Evaluating the above framework in the particular case of Tanzania, we discuss
 how quality in non-durable consumption could be segregated by long-term
 characteristics (e.g.
 such as education of parents) and availability of certain durable goods.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen has explored the psychological
 basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

 - but Veblen hardly dwells upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

Assisted with the developments in game theory and an improvement in the
 quality of microdata from consumption surveys, an interest in Veblen's
 observations has been revived in the recent years (see Frank

 We argue that this recent attention to status consumption need not to be
 viewed asunder from the consumer demand literature on habit-formation (see
 for example Muellbauer

 for the classical treatment of quality and cost-of-living indices).
 Using the intertemporal framework with life-cycle assumptions, one could
 view status consumption as an inertia in moving away from a state of higher
 quality - a tendency that may in turn depend on the long-term characteristics
 such as social identity or education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevance of social identities in consumption habits has been a theme
 visited by much of the literature in conspicuous consumption (see Chao
 et al.

).
 The literature in marketing studies has similarly explored identity formation
 with acquired goods.
 A model that views consumption in the context of a ranking order based
 on income or wealth, could be used to endogenise the role of social identity
 in conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of status most commonly used in literature is one where it is
 one of the long-term characteristics of the consumer.
 This allows the studies in sociology and health sciences to use status
 as simply a vector eduction or income (see Michelson et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MichelsonMunizDeRose2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Psake et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PsakiSeidman2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a few examples).
 Using such a definition for status consumption poses a certain parardox
 - if status was only accumulated over a sufficiently long-term, how can
 there be any utility from status consumption in an intertemporal framework?
 This seeming paradox however is easily resolved when one considers that
 status is subject to change with consumption - just the way it is shaped
 by income or education.
 This is the widely accepted view of status provided by Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism"

\end_inset

 who view status as an income-based ranking order that can be altered by
 the consumer with consumption.
 In other words, a consumer achieves status utility through status consumption
 by moving herself up in a ranking order that is otherwise determined by
 wealth and income.
 This is the view that we use in our intertemporal formulation of status
 consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of developing economies, this view raises some fundamental
 questions on whether the status goods in a developing country should be
 the same as those that are considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the developed economies or not.
 As the relative wealth differences are more relevant for status differences
 in the developing countries, the wealth differences could have far more
 weight for status than the limited range of visible items available to
 a consumer in the developing world (where industrial development is concentrate
d into fewer urban areas).
 We find that the presence of wealth differences in the developing countries
 is not always given its due attention in much of the literature on conspicuous
 consumption we have surveyed (except for some studies directly exploring
 the effect income inequality on conspicuous consumption with exogenously
 observed poverty/income levels or GINI indices - see Jaikumar 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Chai et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Some studies, we find, include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in status-related consumption while others choose to focus on
 non-durable consumption.
 We believe that an intertemporal substitution approach - which explicitly
 considers the role of wealth differences on status - could help us assess
 whether the particular long-term durable goods should be viewed as part
 of status consumption in an economy or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed the presence of social segregation or varied social identities poses
 another issue with the identification of visible consumption - a problem
 less tractable than the differences in wealth levels.
 Social segregation may imply that the status competitions to reach the
 upper classes are also segmented.
 Thus the very idea of pecuniary emulation which Veblen defines (i.e.
 that the lower economic classes tend to emulate the habits of past upper
 economic classes - whose context in the developing world has been expolored
 in the literature - see Timothy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Srinivas
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

) - ought to be refined based on the importance of one's own reference group
 in status competitions (see Frank
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FrankPond"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Chai
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"

\end_inset

 for the empirical arguments for this refinement).
 Since status competitions are relevant only in one's own reference group,
 the social identities would also influence status consumption within their
 respective corresponding reference groups - much the way wealth differences
 do.
 This is unlikely to be a serious empirical issue in most cases since social
 segregation is often a result of long-term economic differences, but the
 concern that we wish to highlight is that the effect of social identities
 and wealth difference on status consupmption may not necessariliy be aligned.
 A reference group that is poor in absolute terms may not offer better means
 to indicate status but it may offer a pool of smaller fishes - i.e.
 a lower reference point for status utility which the consumer intends to
 maximise.
 Therefore, despite the transformation of consumer markets due to rapid
 industrialisation in many developing countries - where the income differences
 have narrowed and new markets for status have been created (see Srinivas

 than the consumption of a few conspicuous items that are considered visible
 in the developed economies ( see Ustuner-Holt

The questions in the consumer survey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 (which is how a researcher may obtain the list of visible items) is adjusted
 to include items that may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combined effect of social differences and wealth differences on status
 is the quantitative concern that motivates our model for status-related
 consumption.
 If status is viewed as a ranking order based on long-term characteristics
 such as income, education then a certain acquired characteristics and consumpti
on may be seen as a way to offset the deep wealth and social hierarchies
 which determine the ranking (see Corneo 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "corneo_snobbism,ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 For the empirical analyses, the wealth in a developing economy can be proxied
 relatively easily with the stock of durable goods the consumer has (inclusive
 of housing, land and other long-term assets).
 The contribution of non-durable consumption to status - on the other hand
 - is only through the quality of non-durable consumption.
 This is because the fulfillment of basic needs cannot offer any advantage
 in a status competition.
 A consumer with a habit of 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus 
\shape default
have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 Therefore as long as a common set of consumer needs - which are fundamentally
 the same by definition - can be measured in the population being observed,
 there is no status utility to be achieved through addressing of needs themselve
s.
 This has a particular implication for our model of utility - if there is
 any status related utility to be derived from non-durable consumption,
 it would be constituted in the felicity from 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
quality (which is defined as distance from needs which themselves are observed
 within a particular reference group).
 It also follows that any status that is not signaled with quality in non-durabl
e consumption or is associate with innate social characteristics of the
 consumer it must come out of the possession of (utility from) long-term
 durable goods (i.e.
 the proxy of wealth)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To incorporate life-cycle assumptions, we consider a durable long-term only
 if it can be passed on by the consumer to the next generation.
 These determine the long-term demands of the consumer while her short-term
 concerns (which could themselves be influenced by the acquired wealth)
 comprise only of needs and quality (inclusive of short-term durable items
 - if any).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A robust empirical measure of quality has been subject to much debate in
 the litearture owing largely to the lack of sufficiently detailed consumption
 surveys.
 Most consumption surveys hardly record the market-observed prices or the
 quantities of the items consumed - let alone the brand-related details
 of the items.
 This makes the identification of higher quality difficult.
 The market-prices of items purchases or even quantities consumed - which
 could permit us to view quality as the proportion of expensive items standardis
ed by quantity (see Nelson

 Noting the absence of quantities consumed and the detaied prices of key
 diary items, we use the notion of

 indices in the literature - see Fisher 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FisherShell1968"
literal "false"

\end_inset

for the classical approach to the problem).
 We thus observe how the cost of a standard basket of basic needs varies
 across the regions and districts in the economy and infer the varying cost
 of needs as the basis of our measure for quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as the basic needs of the consumer in an economy can be determined,

 An empirical assessment of what is consider

).
 The sticking point then becomes the determination and measurement of the
 needs themselves.
 Here too, the idea that all of us have a set of basic needs has not been
 without controversies.
 On one hand, we have the view that needs are determined solely by subjective
 preferences (see Townsend
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) while on the other, there is the view that a common man's needs can supersede
 her subjective interests (wants).

 proposed by Doyal and Gough

 who consider autonomy itself - in addition to health - as a basic need
 of the consumer without shunning the idea that the needs across cultural
 contexts should be standardised.
 The basic needs of the consumer are thus the standard requirements not
 meeting which would lead to a definite harm (this is in accordance to the
 theory argued for by Doyal and Gough 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 To an argument that a family can survive on just starch, for example, the
 counter-argument would be that a foreseeable damage to the health of the
 consumer incurred by not having other nutrients is definite.
 A starch diet fulfilling the set of dietary needs can thus be ruled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ideas of health and autonomy may be slightly abstract but could roughly
 be interpreted as the internal and external needs of the consumer.
 To infer the reference level of the basic internal needs of the consumer,
 one could simply focus on the biological needs (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 - representing number of household-members, number of children, individual
 age, body weight etc.).
 But since we rely on the total of cost of needs for our notion of quality,
 the measurement of quality also depends on the price of needs.
 The social or spatial context of the consumer has therefore an effect on
 the total cost of basic internal needs of a consumer (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the demographic vector inclusive of spatial identity and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the effective price of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

).
 The external needs of the consumer are not simply biological.
 The ideas of health and autonomy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 - much like external needs - also need to be interpreted in a particular
 social context.
 Consider for example the question whether lodging/home-ownership or the
 primary education of children in the area where a consumer resides should
 be considered a basic need or not.
 Such needs are determined by a social reference point and to define conspicuous
 consumption, we need a point of social reference above which the consumption
 may be treated as conspicuous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue with using simply the biological needs alone as the reference
 is that the approach completely ignores the the peer effects - which have
 an important role in the consumer decision.
 For the purposes of measuring conspicuous consumption, the utility a consumer
 avails from the relative quality depends on her perception of what she
 considers necessary (which comprise of the external needs which may encompassin
g a lot more than health and autonomy).
 Thus the cost of relative quality which the consumer derives utility from
 - implicitly considers what is perceived to be higher quality in the consumer's
 own social reference group.
 The inclusion of peer effects - i.e.
 external needs - is also necessary in our measure for quality (i.e.
 social reference group consumption).

 An interpretation of quality must therefore also rely on the distance of
 a consumer's non-durable consumption relative to the reference group's
 consumption level (i.e.
 the consumption in the immediate surroundings e.g.
 a locality, a relevant social group, income or owner group of the durable
 goods etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice if we were to include life-cycle effects in the model, the needs
 of the consumer are also subject to her age.
 As a consumer acquires long-term durable goods after reaching a working
 age, she must pay maintenance and upkeep costs for the long-term durable
 goods she inherits or purchases.
 Thus, the cost of needs function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 may better be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho,A)$
\end_inset

 which considers the prices of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 for a consumer with a demographic vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and the long-term durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 By owning long-term durable goods, the consumer essentially improves her
 social-reference and aims to get ahead of others by maximising her stock
 of durable goods relative to the reference posession level (let's say 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

 is the reference ownership level).
 The consumer's long-term possessions can be viewed as a commitment that
 to lead to a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\psi,\rho,A)$
\end_inset

.
 The cost of needs provided by such a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and the expenditure on the relative quality availed by the consumer would
 thus constitute the total expenditure on non-durable consumption by the
 consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, if the cost function for quality level 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in non-durable consumption is observed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(\psi,\nu)$
\end_inset

 for needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, then the total non-durable consumption for the consumer can be written
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\kappa(\psi,\nu)+\Psi(\rho,A,\psi)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that status is not considered a need using this approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the level
 of durable goods ownership she achieves while her basic needs are independent
 of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both expensive
 durable goods and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class needs of the
 consumer).
 The difference between the status of a rich and that of a poor family is
 therefore not through disparate educational needs of the rich and poor
 children but instead through a more general need for the family combined
 with a demand for quality for education (with a higher price for higher
 quality).

\begin_layout Standard
To motivate the utility function from the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,\nu,A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 so far, notice that while the consumer does avail utility within a her
 own social reference point (specified by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

), a utility function should represent the case where all consumers are
 permitted to rank (compare) each other.
 This is necessary condition for us to define a common utility function
 applicable to all consumers.
 Since status differences do exist across social reference groups (e.g.
 individuals in one region compare themselves to those from other regions),
 it follows that a consumer must get some utility from the identity of one's
 social reference in order for there to be a higher (lower) status utility
 from a richer (poorer) identity (e.g.
 region, class etc.).
 If this weren't true - i.e.
 if the consumers could get utility inclusive-of-status only from their
 durable goods value and non-durable consumption, then there could be no
 point of indifference at which a consumer in the poor neighborhood could
 trade places with another in a richer neighborhood.
 For status consumption to have some utility to the consumer, the utility
 function - which is the same for all consumers - must also depend on group
 identity in some way so that a rich consumer with low-positioning can be
 convinced to trade places with someone in the poor neighborhood who has
 a higher (local) social-positioning.
 A common utility function for all consumers and the presence of status-related
 consumption - both allow a small fish in a big pond to trade places with
 a big fish in a small pond.
 This is made possible both with i) social positioning within a reference
 group and ii) the utility from identity to a reference group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider an example to illustrate this further.
 Let there be consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 who live in a poor region (small pond) and a rich region (big pond) and
 their non-durable consumption levels be 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{P},c_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Further, the average consumption levels in the regions they reside are
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Let's also assume that the values of their respective long-term durable
 goods bear the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}<A_{R}$
\end_inset

 - which is the same for the average asset ownership of the regions 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 ,
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

 respectively i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{P}$
\end_inset

 <
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{A}_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 If we now consider the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{P},\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

 then the cost above needs can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}=\frac{c_{P}-\Psi_{P}}{\psi_{P}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{R}=\frac{c_{R}-\Psi_{R}}{\psi_{R}}$
\end_inset

.
 If status utility were to be only achieved through durable goods and quality
 and if utility were a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A$
\end_inset

 then there would be no two values of indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nu_{P},A_{P})\sim(\nu_{R},A_{R})$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 would trade places (ponds) with 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the utility model must consider the role of regional identity (or
 peer effects more generally - that can be proxied with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}_{P},\bar{c}_{R}$
\end_inset

, the durable goods values 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P},A_{R}$
\end_inset

 or simply the region dummy).
 Such a utility would allow 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 to increase her non-durable quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}$
\end_inset

 so that she is indifferent to moving to an urban area even for a higher
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{P}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the principle we use to develop the utility function further in

Assuming that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular sense
 - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for visible consumption
 can be considered separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 We do not find futility assumption plausible for the data we observe in
 the developing countries.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 The most relevant feature of visiblity based models is the separability
 of necessary items from conspicuous items that is offered by assuming the
 conspicuous items are futile (an argument attributed to Veblen).
 To accommodate this assertion, the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption
 often includes items that are just commonly understood to have some signaling
 value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 In a nascent modern economy, however, we find that the bandwagon items
 such as electronics or cars pose obvious empirical concerns as they are
 hardly futile but also serve status needs due to the rapid and recent urbanisat
ion.
 The futility assumption is therefore hardly suitable for a model that cognisant
 of wealth differences in a rapidly developing economy.
 We therefore use a slightly different approach to status consumption that
 is based on the role that long-term durable goods may play towards status

 While these could be related to snob and bandwagon behaviours (see Corneo

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term consumer needs
 does not view status consumption as futile but relates it with measures
 of wealth.
 Status may not be changed by fulfillment of basic needs but is influenced
 both by long-term possessions and non-durable consumption in an intermporal
 setting that we use to understand the status consumption in an economy.
 Unlike in PIH, the accumulation of long-term durable goods - rather than
 volatility in income - have an influence on the substitution between savings
 and quality in the intertemporal model.

Hierarchy of Consumer Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The claim that much of our model rests upon is that status is a part of
 the consumer's long-term utility.
 If status weren't part of the consumer's long-term utility, the representative
 consumer in a model would have no reason to engage in status-related consumptio
n in any form.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a
 consumer can achieve a higher status in the model by the acquisition of
 durable goods (which is assisted with higher income) as well as by the
 status promotion through high-quality non-durable consumption (which may
 enhance social interactions and improve the consumer's self-image).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have discussed before, the role of non-durable consumption is two-fold
 in our model - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer
 and second, it achieves high-quality consumption with status-related goals.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity in
 the present as well as a possible status advantage - since all else being
 the same, someone consuming a higher quality is likely to have more status
 than someone consuming a lower quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[HIERARCHY] The status derived from consumption overall is a combination
 of short-term and long-term gains of the consumer.
 The former is through non-durable consumption and the latter through acquisitio
n of long-term goals.
 The approach to view dynamics of status can similarly be enhanced to view
 the social characteristics such as residence neighborhood or social class
 as cumulative status items acquired over multiple generations.
 Status competitions - which develop within a particular social reference
 group - can support such a view of status if we assume that the rewards
 of status are passed on to the progeny.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this temporal hierarchy of status utility, a few goods that bring status
 are more temporary than others.
 Social identity is most permanent of all, while ownership of durable goods
 is more permanent than the non-durable consumption.
 In a model for intertemporal substitution, the representative consumer,
 once having addressed her basic needs, attempts to distribute her income
 outlay into the three variables that offer varied permanence of status.
 The social characteristics - denoted by the demographic vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the most permanent parameter to the utility function.
 To compare the influence of different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, we assume that the utility depends on the average value of all long-term
 possessions in the group.
 Therefore, the utility derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would be proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

.
 That's the only way 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 provides utility to the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ownership of durable goods is more dynamic means of indicating status
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 The durable good that are inheritable items would either be transferred
 or acquired with money
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some emprical judgment may need to be exercised for short-term durable goods
 that would not survive over the lifetime of the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As we have already considered the role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

, the utility through durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is always relative to the social reference level 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the utility from durable goods is proportional to (
\begin_inset Formula $A-m(\int_{\rho}A)$
\end_inset

) where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is measure of the group-level durable-goods possession 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

.
 The ownership of durable goods is to be tracked with an asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - whose value is reflected in the total cost of durable goods.
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase durable goods and the actual
 purchase of durable goods.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
 Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all long-term
 durable goods in the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success
 to preferences being the same for everybody) that provides furniture, housing
 and all amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every durable goods  and service - offered as a life-long subscription
 - can be purchased by paying an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to this company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most transient of all possessions are items that are strictly non-durable.
 We have already defined a control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 as the measure of quality tracked by the consumption above needs and the
 costs imposed by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 By the very definition of the needs, a consumer is meant to select a quality
 control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 only after her basic needs - internal and external - are fulfilled (including
 the maintenance costs that are imposed by ownership of durable goods).
 The control for quality (
\shape italic

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the household.
 The higher its value, higher would be the distance from needs consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 (and lower would be the future growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 does depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, so a consumer who changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (by moving residence or being initiated into an new social group) faces
 a new set of needs based on her new environment (and does not carry over
 her habits in from the past environment).
 This effectively means that the utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is obtained through a measure of group behaviour associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 the costs in the new neighborhood for somebody who moves into a new neighborhoo

\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 However, the choice amongst 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,A$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 is not lexicographic.
 Therefore the consumers with the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 would compete for status with with different 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the consumers with the same level of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 must then compete for with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 A simple utility function that handles this substitution could be a loglinear
 formulation:

\end{alignat}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{A}+k_{\psi}+k_{\nu}+k_{\rho}=1$
\end_inset

.
 We revisit the limitations of the above formulation later, but the above
 function does allow the representative consumers with a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

[CONSTRAINTS] Another feature of the consumer choice with variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,A,\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 we wish to consider is that the longer-term choices impose some constraints
 on the available short-term choices.
 The longer-term choices are not therefore simply more permanent but also
 expand the possibilities of more temporary venues of status utility.
 The state of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 constraint the available choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - which in turn may constrain the choices for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Consumers with lower weight for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A-\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 may therefore compensate by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 but only as much.
 For example, in the household category, high prices of housing may encourage
 the consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

) but she may only improve the overall quality instead of buying a bigger
 house only until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-durable costs imposed by the durable goods one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.) may imply either that avoiding the respective expenses
 is not an option for the consumer owning some durable goods or that some
 certain long-term choices or characteristics (e.g.
 not having a house or living in a region that doesn't have electricity
 available) would limit the choice to avail quality through non-durable
 consumption.
 Regardless of which mechanism causes this constraint, we assume that necessitie
s of the consumer as she acquires durable goods are considered the part

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$

 In other words, the concerns of mobility are more important earlier in

An empirical consideration in the above model is that the assumption that
 at the of the lifetime of a consumer, the personal wealth of the consumer
 would either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so that the
 asset account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth of some
 other household(s) in the economy.
 Consequently, while all individuals in the population are assumed to be
 the same as our representative consumer in terms of the preferences for
 needs over quality, they do differ in the the starting amount of their
 asset accounts as well as the trends of their salaries.
 The quality habits of quality (
\shape italic
excess

) depend on these long-term characteristics.
 More particularly, if a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and her salary after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 then at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased some long-term durable-goods from a portion of
 her income - deciding that she does not want more durable goods for the
 rest of her life.
 Alternatively, she could have experienced a change in the life-circumstances
 (needing a bigger or a more expensive house) thus needing more durable
 goods urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Due to the minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing countries,
 we assume a negligible credit in the market.
 This in turn also implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of
 the only durable goods available in the market.

 all of the consumer's durable goods being liquidated and consumed in the

 But if we observe the change in asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 at every period in our model, we can take a slightly different approach
 with a dynamic optimisation formulation.
 Denoting 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, we write the following budget constraints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
J_{1}\equiv x_{1}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{1},A_{1})=(P_{\nu,1}\psi_{1})\nu_{1}+\Delta_{1}P_{A,1}\\
J_{2}\equiv x_{2}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{2},A_{2})=(P_{\nu,2}\psi_{2})\nu_{2}+\Delta_{2}P_{A,2}

 needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(\rho,\psi_{1},A_{1}),\Psi(\rho,\psi_{2},A_{2})$
\end_inset

 (in periods 1 and 2 respectively).
 The intertemporal substitution implies that she may save for growth to
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of consuming all her outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$

 i.e.
 she can spend all of

 as

 If we observe the states of the wealth

Since we assume that needs grow deterministically i.e.
 that the process

\end_inset

 in the period

\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{t}=x_{t}-\Psi(\rho,\psi_{t},A_{t})=\iota(i_{t},\psi_{t},A_{t})$
\end_inset

.
 To motivate the dynamic programming approach to this solution, consider
 first what consumer's choices would be in a one-period consumption.
 Here, she could either spend her outlay as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{_{1}}=\nu_{1}\psi_{1}+\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or keep the minimum consumption (

 If we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$

\end_inset

.
 Let this utility be 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*},A_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 To extend this to two periods with dynamic optimisation one can exploit
 the fact that a consumer independently optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 would always obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 This is because if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are unbounded functions 
\begin_inset Formula $max(u_{1}+u_{2})\le max(u_{1})+max(u_{2})=u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is only a tool to formulate the dynamic optimisation approach - using which
 the value of utility is to be optimised over her life period in a 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

-period model (
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 being the age of the consumer).
 Thus in the optimisation of utility function in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

[COST FUNCTION - MERGE INTO SOLUTION FOR DIRUTIL] A cost-function approach
 is more generic than the log-linear method we have used in the direct utility
 above.
 Before we argue for a general PIGLOG cost-function, we first demonstrate
 the limtiation of the cost-function corrsesponding to the above direct
 utility.
 For a general 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\beta_{i}log(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, if the budget constraint is set to be 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=\textbf{p}\cdot\textbf{q}$
\end_inset

, the optimisation using a Lagrangian leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $L=u-\lambda(\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}-x)$
\end_inset

 and the first-order conditions result in 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
x=\sum{p_{i}q_{i}}\\
\frac{\beta_{i}}{q_{i}-\gamma_{i}}=\lambda p_{i}
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{i}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})=1$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})=\beta_{i}(x-\sum{p_{i}\gamma_{i}})$
\end_inset

 (this is the Marshallian demand function).
 The indirect utility function - of which cost function is the inverse of
 - can be written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
u & =\sum{\beta_{i}}log(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}(x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}))
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum{\beta_{k}}=1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})+\sum\beta_{i}log((x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}))\Rightarrow u=\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})+log(x-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}})$
\end_inset

 The cost function thus becomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
log(c(u,\textbf{p})-\sum{p_{k}\gamma_{k}}) & =u-\sum\beta_{i}log(\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}})\label{eq:loglineargeneral}

\begin_layout Standard
The argument with dual function shows just how restrictive a loglinear direct
 utility function really is.
 The direct utility form claims that the price derivatives of cost-functions
 (which are typically equated with the budget ratio) are the same for both
 subsistence and bliss sub-utilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this detour is only to motivate a more general cost function.
 While we find it easy to speak in terms of the direct utility in plain
 English (the consumer gets more utility from bread than from vegetables
 etc.), the equivalent dual form offers the same argument with clear advantages.
 Just the way the direct utility function with a budget constraints tells
 us that a higher price would make it difficult to obtain the same utility
 (comprising of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{q}=\{q_{i}\}$
\end_inset

), the cost-function tells us in a less convoluted way that a higher price
 would cause a consumer to get less utility for the same cost (
\begin_inset Formula $x=c(u,\textbf{p})$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the intertemporal substitution problem that we attempt to solve in the
 current chapter, a consumer is set to choose between availing 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 which she consumes in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and increasing asset account 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{t}=A_{t}-A_{t-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The log-function approach would tell us that the price sensitivity of sub-cost-
functions for bliss and subsistence ought to be the same.
 This is a strong assumption except when we assume that the savings rate
 of the consumer (choice between consuming in the current period vs saving
 for future) may not change over the lifeitme.
 This mau seem less problematic than the equivalent simpler problem where
 a consumer chooses between multiple commodities in the same period.
 A general cost-function could help us relieve that and allows us to use
 a time-varying coefficients for savings rate.
 If we assume that the consumer budget ratios (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=\frac{\partial c(u,\textbf{p})}{\partial p_{i}}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall i$
\end_inset

 ) are more 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

-heavy at subsistence levels (one desperately wants to be richer when one
 is poorer) but more 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

-heavy at bliss levels, then the logarithmic is no longer appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[WHICH COST FUNCTION] To argue that the savings rate depends on age or the

\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This is not unlike the conditions of the developing world.
 Lower intergenerational mobility means that better opportunities for future
 wealth tend to be limited to those who are already (somewhat) wealthy.
 The heterogeneity of prices is also supported by high transportation costs
 and the observation that the poor live in areas where bliss is lower (overall)
 compared to where the rich tend to live (higher 
\begin_inset Formula $b(p)$
\end_inset

).
 The role of peer effects can also be reflected in the cost-function since
 - someone not so rich might want to stay in a poor neighborhood if she
 prefers to have a higher relative income (this is unlikely to happen at
 lower levels of subsistence).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the opposite direction of peer effects and poverty have an influence
 on the preference of saving vs consumption.

\begin_layout Standard
The unavailability of prices is an obvious hurdle - but as it turns out
 it's not the price of the items but of commodities ( needs or quality)
 that the cost-function representing consumer choice is concerned with.
 The econometric methods therefore proceed by factoring in the local variation
 of price of a common set of needs.
 As we have argued before, the life-cycle effects can be handled with age-depend
ent of coefficients in the cost-function.
 These are implicitly included since the price of quality increases with
 increase in needs (

Cost of Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input for the cost of needs is the diary of food items and the recall
 diary for upto one year.
 The consumption of the items that are considered necessities is calculated
 for the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 The cost of needs thus calculated in this manner (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) depend on the particular locality where the household is located.
 Given the categories of consumption in Tanzania i.e.
 food, household, energy and transport, we calculate the cost of basic needs
 as the cost of minimal requirements in every category.
 As an example, we use the commodity sub-groups of carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables in the food category.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - which is composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - are then calculated in each region and district based
 on the prices of the items recorded in the survey (which records the prices
 at the district level as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket could be a
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - as these are most often
 the cheapest items in their respective sub-group (
\begin_inset Formula ${carb,fact,protein,fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the cost of this basket thus calculated is much higher
 in the urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 The cost thus calculated is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the food component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al

 and https://energypedia.info/ for data on typical energy usage in the developing

For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 The costs of clothing in the region for a particular year are included
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The running costs of the house - depending on whether it's owned or rented
 are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 When the house is rented, the running costs are simply the reported rent
 on the house whereas when the house is owned by the household, a 2.5% of
 the cost of the house is used (the maintenance rate is estimated based
 on the expenditure reported in the survey for the houses that report maintenanc
e on the owned house) .
 The matching of need with the level of durable goods owned is similar to
 how the energy costs are set up based on the type of durable good one possesses.
\end_layout

Under transport category, the public-transport costs and petrol consumption
 costs (which in turn depend on whether a consumer owns a motor-bike or

 Thus, a user of electricity does not have much signaling advantage when

 electrical items rather than the consumption (part of

Quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[CALCULATING QUALITY] The non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is seen as the sum of the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the excess consumptsion is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 which acts as the quality control in the model where the utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\rho,\psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of the owned durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The quality chosen by the consumer is calculated as the difference between
 her reported non-durable consumption and the cost of needs (evaluated locally
 at the district level in the data)
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that relying only on the total costs associated with a commodity
 (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality or 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
cannot differentiate between the consumption of a higher quantity and of
 a higher quality.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 for a commodity priced 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$
\end_inset

, then our quality metric for the consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

).
 That said, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity
 are available in the region or not, it is possible to draw conclusions
 about over-consumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity (more so when a pseudo-panel analysis
 is used).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The reference point of needs is crucial to our notion of quality as it
 is simply a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 For food commodities, standardising a set of needs general across the populatio
n is relatively easy - as the cost of needs in food would simply be the
 cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs, fruits etc.

 of households in the family

 items as basic needs.
 Considering the commodities food, energy, transport and household
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A different set of categories could be chosen for another consumption dataset.

 for example, what constitutes a basic house or a basic set of furniture
 requires some justification based on a cultural or geographic context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the costs incurred due to maintenance, usage and upkeep of the
 long-term durable goods is also included in the reference level non-durable
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and would thus bear a higher non-durable
 consumption level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

(while the consumer that does not own any electrical goods would not have
 the same non-durable consumption).
 To illustrate this further, consider a consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 with a refrigerator and another consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 without a refrigerator who both have the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and the same set of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 .
 Let's 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=1$
\end_inset

 in this particular example.
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{R'}<\Psi_{R}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{R'}>c_{t}-\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

) .
 But does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 Not only is it that the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity groups
 (over energy or durable goods for example).
 In fact, there is little sense in claiming that the quality in one commodity
 can be substituted with quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality is meaningful only with the consideration of
 a total cost of basic needs level 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The notion of excess - subject to such a level - is thus the only a way
 to assess overall quality in non-durable consumption.
 Thus if having a refrigerator is not considered a need, then we may say
 nothing more than that 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

.
 By avoiding counting maintenance costs in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, we merely maintain the same interpretation

It is possible that ownership of some durable goods generates some rental
 income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, such income would be considered an additional stream of income instead

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical method for adjusting necessities based on the durable goods
 one possesses is straightforward if we assume a typical usage for all expensive
 durable goods owned.
 If a household possesses a car, then the needs of the household would be
 incremented with the petrol consumption per year and maintenance for a
 typical usage.
 This also means that some costs of needs (e.g.
 for food) are multiplied by the number of household members in the family
 while other needs aren't - as we obtain the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for a particular household (see Section

It could be argued that the social characteristics that are acquired over
 life-time may need to be treated to as durable-good.
 For characteristics such as education, while being educated could be treated
 as a personal characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, a case may be made for education to be treated as a long-term durable
 good that is valid for an inter-generational transfer.
 Since education requires a long investment over time and has a certain
 value in the employment market, we cannot prevent such a consideration
 in the model for consumer choice.
 The caveat is only that the long-term choice (such as committing to the
 education of one's progeny) should be considered as part of durable goods
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in the model only as long as the costs of maintenance (e.g.
 school fees) can be included in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
 If not, then such a long-term choice must be considered as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - probably equivalent to moving residence or entering a new social network.
 One could say rather facetiously that education may not be an asset in
 the regular sense since an educated individual is hardly required to pay
 a maintenance fee for having been educated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the classification of long-term durable goods themselves, an item
 can be included in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\end_inset

) only if it can be passed on through generations.
 The durable goods that cannot be passed through generations are not considered
 long-term and excluded from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

Durable goods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey includes everything from
 a mobile phone to land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 The details of records include the number of durable goods owned by the
 household, the reported cost at which the durable good was purchased and
 the price the household expects by selling the durable good in the market
 at the time of the survey.
 While these data fields are promising for the intertemporal setting we
 wish to make use of, some refinement of this data is necessary due to the
 measurement errors with the costs and the current price (the latter is
 referred to as marked-to-market average or mtm average in the current discussio
n).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue with the reported cost is typical of those based on a consumer
 recall.
 Recorded by the survey at two time-points spread across two years (let's
 call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs may change over a period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) may be significantly different from the cost recorded in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 To some extent, the reported cost of the durable goods follows the mtm
 average which itself is less susceptible to the issue as it is not recalled
 from consumer's memory and reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable
 good over time instead.
 The mtm average of the durable goods (like the cost of the durable good)
 is a value averaged over the number of durable goods owned by consumer.
 Therefore, the cost incurred by the purchase of a new durable good - that
 we're interested in - is not directly observed in the mtm average and relies
 on the field indicating number of durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the value of new purchases relies on the number of durable goods observed
 in the survey, we detect an durable good purchase only when a difference
 in the number of durable goods over the successive years is observed.
 The difference between the mtm average is thus recorded as part of new
 durable goods only as long as we observe a difference in number of durable
 goods in the two-year period (i.e.
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 The number of durable goods observed however is also subject to some measuremen
t error and requires some further refinements for us to calculate the total
 cost of durable goods.
 That said, since we are interested in the the new durable good purchases
 for our analysis, someone buying their first music player is unlikely to
 make counting errors than someone adding to their collection of music systems.
 We thus look for significant changes in durable goods numbers (e.g.
 if they change from 0 to 1 or substantially 3 to 5 or to 6,7...
 etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible issue with a calculation of durable good cost changes as outlined
 above is that the measurement error with the number of durable goods may
 get magnified for more expensive durable goods such as house.
 However, since we also observe whether the individual owns a house or not
 from the household questionnaire (which records the housing-status through
 a direct question), we confirm that this error is not significant after
 reconciling the calculated differences with the data from the household
 questionnaire.
 What this reconciliation does remind us however is that the durable goods
 recorded in the survey indicate whether the household uses (or has access
 to) the durable goods rather than what it owns
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A lot of households in rented or employer-provided houses report having
 a house.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since rental options - except for housing - are fairly limited in the developin
g economies, this does not pose a significant measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final caveat for the data is the presence of split households.
 A significant portion of the households may split into two or more households.
 Considering a split household as the terminal state of a household, we
 don't consider the parent household while calculating durable good differences
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 if it has terminated in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, durable good net-differences are included only as long
 as the households have not split in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+1$
\end_inset

.
 As explained in the discussion of the model, we only wish to consider durable
 goods that can be potentially transferred over generations (it is easy
 to verify these when the households are split).
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data, we consider any durable good more expensive
 than bed as eligible to be transferred to the next generation.
 This can be verified with the data on split household.
 The durable goods in the survey that are not life-long durable goods e.g.
 mobile phones, dish-tv etc.
 are not considered in the net-durable good changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{\tau+1}=A_{\tau+1}-A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a median-cost order of the durable goods recorded in 2014).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For robustness tests to our conclusions, we attempt to both sharpen and
 smoothen the data on durable goods changes by considering purchases within
 coarser groups such as electronic items, furniture etc.
 and by turning off the effect of depreciation in the durable good difference
 calculation respectively.
 The first test to sharpen the data is with classification of new durable
 goods into coarser categories - which is useful in its own right in order
 to interpret the distribution of functional durable goods - since counting
 the instances of purchases of just any electronic item may make more sense
 than the purchase of individual items such as a music system or a CD player.
 The appeal of the grouping approach is also due the extreme differences
 in urban and rural markets in an economy like Tanzania.
 Grouping the durable goods into agricultural electronic, electric and livestock
 categories accentuates the minor additions to one's durable goods - by
 giving the cheaper durable goods purchased by the consumer the same treatment
 as the more expensive durable goods.
 The downside with such a grouping is of course this very collation of durable
 goods with vast differences in prices within a single group (cd-player
 and music system for example may have vast differences in prices but could
 be counted as a new electronic durable good purchased).
 As our primary intention has been to get the total durable goods costs
 we have refrained from using such grouping as a primary means of analyses.

The method to smoothen the data on the other hand has clear advantages.
 As we have noted earlier, in every two years of the survey, the mtm-average
 by the household is susceptible to both how the household interviewee may
 estimate the change in the market and whether the interviewee from the
 household in a particular year is different from the interviewee household
 member in another year.
 The durable goods data can thus be smoothened by separating the effect
 of these factors if we can consider only only one year's prices.
 To explain this with an example, consider an durable good 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 whose value is 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the reported average mtm of the durable good at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of durable goods the household possesses.
 To avoid the measurement error associated with the difference in the estimate
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, we prefer to use the mtm-average estimate (price) at either from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the difference in cost of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 could be either be 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}P_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t}P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 Choosing the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 however leads us to another issue due to the sparsity of data.
 As we rely on a district-level granularity of data, not only would we not
 have the price reported for an item not owned by the consumer in period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, there may not be enough purchases in the district for us to estimate the
 cost of the item that consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One way to circumvent this is to classify all durable goods into cheap,
 middle-range and expensive categories based on cost quantiles in the period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and then determine the category of the durable good purchased in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 based on its price in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 The price at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would then by the price of matching category (expensive, middle-range or
 cheap) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Since, we may as well use the price at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, this indirect methods is rendered unnecessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As we're interested in the price for the new purchases (i.e.
 cases such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}>0$
\end_inset

), the prices at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset

) do not suffer with this issue.
 The expenditure on new durable goods calculated is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Delta n_{a,t+1}=P_{a,t+1}(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 error in the estimate provided by the household member interviewee.

 The disposable income

 are represented with At and c.At#c.age represents the interaction between
 the age and

\end_inset

 (the c.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical life-cycle consumption patterns can be confirmed with the significan
ce of age-related coefficients.
 More particularly, the quality (excess) consumption seems to decline with
 age while durable good purchases do not seem to be influenced by age as
 much.
 Apart from the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and needs, the disposable income (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

) also depends on the durable goods someone owns through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which includes durable good-bearing costs).
 Thus a weak significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 simultaneously with a strong significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 implies a stronger effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that have much influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (durable goods such as land that do not require a high maintenance cost
 proportional to their cost are purchased less often than those that have
 higher bearing costs).
 Further, the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 is negative while it is positive for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that higher disposable income (lower needs or higher income)
 is more often associated with higher quality (excess) and less durable
 good purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is statistically weak, but the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is quite significant.
 More durable goods purchases are made by those who are already rich in
 relative terms, the new durable goods purchased are mostly those that are
 associated with high running costs.
 While the distribution of wealth - reflected in the ownership of expensive
 durable goods such as a house or land - do determine which consumers purchase
 new durable goods, the significance of disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

 (shown as lt1 in the table) - which we estimate using occupation, education
 and needs over the years 2012 and 2014 - and its negative coefficient for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 indicates that the new durable goods are purchased by those with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which is inclusive of durable goods bearing costs) and/or the new durable
 good purchases are by those who have relatively less incomes (
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 estimated through better occupation and education).
 This trend seems to reverse for the measure of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the ownership of durable good such as land and housing, disposable
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the sort of wealth that lends to more social mobility.
 The educated and the highly-paid may pass on their skills and social networks
 to the progeny, but the transfer of such soft-durable goods to the next
 generation is more dissipative than the monetary wealth.
 Such soft-assets might not result in the ownership of more expensive durable
 goods (such as housing or land) but these do require consumption on education
 and social functions anyways.
 The durable good purchases may suggest the limits of the durable goods
 purchases.
 This is made clearer with the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for expenditure on quality(
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
) consumption indicates.
 Those with less durable goods but with better income do seem to spend more
 on quality (including education).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in urban and rural lifestyles also play a role in the difference
 in durable good purchases as well as quality.
 This is in particular due to the the availability of electricity being
 limited to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for and more likely to
 deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a need to exercise caution in the interpretation of the tobit /
 OLS results using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which - in econometric terms - is treated as a proxy for prices, regional
 variations, age and the effects of wealth.
 To allow our conclusions to be more robust, it may be worthwhile to to
 decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 into more control variables - possibly by reformulating the model in the
 Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dAt_regression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 to employ a quantile regression based on age, income, durable good costs
 - while still maintaining the key purpose of the model which is to separate
 means of income from wealth in an analysis of the intertemporal substitution
 between durable good purchases and quality (excess) under a life-cycle
 setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived risk in one's stability of wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the the participants exhibiting a risk-seeking
 behaviour (i.e.
 a disproportionate expenditure) towards goods and services that may lead
 to a large payoff (immense success) with a small probability (through joining
 golf clubs, engaging in social events - status competitions with a small
 upfront cost).
 This may serve as a refinement to the conventional assumptions of a balance
 between the urban and rural prices in the models that explore rural migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While visible items do capture such risk-seeking behaviours in the developed
 economies very well, the difference in wealth and the segregation of quality
 of life in the developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they
 may be in segregated societies in the developed economies).
 Without a
\bar under
 
\bar default
consideration of how the durable goods are distributed in the economy and
 are subject to change, one must be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed this is not to say that the consumption on items that are categorically
 visible does not tell us much about the demand in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption - and is worth exploring in its own right - but
 if one were to develop a theory of status consumption instead of revisiting
 visible consumption in varied cultural contexts in this manner, the considerati
ons of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership seem an obvious
 first step.
 Indeed in the particular case of marriages too, we would only improve our
 understanding of the bride price if we realise that marriages are both
 an indication of one's social status as well as a potential for advancement
 in social ranking - forces that are at play in durable goods purchases
 more generally in much the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the literature on rural and urban differences in the developing
 world should be extended to include status consumption on grounds of generality.
 The context of status consumption varies significantly across economies
 and one often needs to make adjustments for the particular social conditions
 to draw conclusions on visible consumption.
 Using an intertemporal behavioural model to explain consumption may help
 us in standardising the markets for status in disparate economies and help
 us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across the various states of economies.
