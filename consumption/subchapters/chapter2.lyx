\begin_layout Title
Status consumption under extreme asset differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
While status consumption is assumed to be ubiquitous, the possibility that
 extreme wealth inequalities in an economy could discourage status comparisons
 across reference groups separated by wealth has been explored less often.
 Comparing non-durable consumption in two sub-Saharan African developing
 economies, we explore the opposing effects of peer influences and extreme
 wealth differences on non-durable consumption.
 Using the LSMS data from Tanzania and Nigeria, we estimate the extent to
 which the non-durable consumption relevant for status indication may be
 segregated by asset ownership levels in the two economies.

 is even valid or not - as we compare the perspectives of Veblen, Baudrillard,

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%[Fundamental Needs are the same for the rich] We use the view of status
 as a context driven utility from consumption and wealth to argue also that
 the richer consumers do not have fundamentally different needs - but context-dr
iven costs of status indication.
 The reference dependent status consumption implies that there exists universal
 need of status consumption - but not that the fundamental needs themselves
 are higher for a richer consumer.
 For example, a rich neighborhood having high prices of food does not mean
 that the needs for food are costlier for the richer consumer (if that was
 true, an arbitrageur would take advantage to offer cheaper prices for food
 with the difference in prices for food explained accounted only by costs
 of transportation).
 If we can admit that consumers optimise life-style choices and goals higher
 than nutrition, then the higher costs on food are likely to be be intertwined
 with long-term choices of the consumer (which force her to be a neighborhood
 with higher food prices).
 More expenses on fundamental needs might be a consequence of availing higher
 status - rather than having different needs per se (this is explained by
 Maliath as non-transactional optimisations).

Research goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the proposed chapter is to find out whether in an environment
 of wealth disparities, the consumers i) rule out status comparisons beyond
 their immediate reference groups (leading to status competitions that are
 essentially non-overlapping) or instead ii) substitute being in a poorer
 reference group (having less assets) with high status consumption? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assess this empirically by comparing the non-durable consumption and
 long-term assets in Tanzania and Nigeria - the two developing economies
 in sub-Saharan Africa.
 We test in particular if the consumers in richer references consumer less
 or more non-durable consumption relative to their needs.
 We also comment if in the specific context of urbanisation-related developments
, status consumption could be largely an appeal for urbanisation in the
 poorest sections of the developing economies.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the intertemporal substitution framework has been widely used in consumer
 economics, its applications in status consumption have been limited.
 The unavailability of brand variety in the data and the often insufficient
 prices of supposed status goods restrict the applications using intertemporal
 substitution.
 The peculiar characteristic of a status item wherein it both indicates
 a rich consumer's exclusive status and creates bandwagons for the poorer
 consumer also poses a challenge - if the demand for status items is always
 set to grow for all consumers as they acquire more assets, then there is
 little substitution between savings and status consumption.
 The intertemporal approach thus seems to be of little use unless one is
 able to track the varying contexts of the consumers as they acquire more
 assets.
 In the proposed chapter, we use a particular dataset on ownership of long-term
 assets along side with the consumption diary to infer the context of status
 consumption in a developing economy.
 Using a model that assumes status to be implied by long-term durable goods
 and modified by local relative advantage in non-durable consumption, we
 examine how the demand for non-durable consumption in relative to one's
 needs varies across disparate regions in two economies in sub-Saharan Africa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, we view status consumption as the expenditure on non-durable
 consumption made to overcome the role of long-term assets and demographic
 characteristics such as education, class or region associated with the
 household.
 The long-term assets are not considered the part of status consumption
 in this approach.
 The argument relies on status being shaped by two components.
 First is the stable component that stays unchanged in the short-term.
 This component includes long-established states e.g.
 education, occupation, ancestral social roles and long-term assets.
 The second component - the consumption that may offset the wide differences
 created by the first component - is what we measure as status consumption.
 The differences among the consumers with different long-term assets in
 terms of the non-durable consumption plus the small non-inheritable assets
 provide us a way to measure the status consumption in the current chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we compare the non-durable consumption in the two economies and comment
 on the relative importance of status consumption, the notion of a status
 reference group is key to our understanding of the consumer's context.
 Reference groups effectively help us pin down a certain level of status
 consumption as the consumer's social need.
 They also allow us to answer if the not-so-rich spend disproportionately
 higher on status items in an economy or if the high spending on status
 goods is limited to the rich.
 Here, unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary
 emulation (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative
 - reference groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions
 where a consumer identifies her status.
 This is of critical importance since the consumer's social need for status
 is hardly as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the proposed model, reference groups are interpreted as the level of
 asset-ownership in the consumer's immediate environment.
 A consumer who resides in an area where the population has more durable
 assets transferable over generations is considered a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

higher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (richer) reference group.
 We denote the richness of a certain reference groups as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
 The richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 of reference group of the consumer- a cluster of consumer households in
 the proximity of consumer - is determined by the long-term assets owned
 in the consumer's locality (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The effect of these reference groups on non-durable consumption are then
 tested empirically

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a level of needs fixed, there are the only two ways in which a consumer
 can achieve status - either by increasing her asset ownership or improving
 her non-durable consumption excluding costs of maintaining assets.
 A consumer in a richer asset-ownership reference - who may have higher
 needs (which we assess with the asset-related costs in data) - would only
 be concerned with the level of non-durable consumption (excluding asset-mainten
ance costs) within her own reference rather than with the level in the poorer
 reference where either or both of non-durable consumption and asset-ownership
 could be lower.
 Within the asset-ownership reference, therefore, the consumers are meant
 compete only with non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We address the limitations to this assumption with the particular granularity
 of the asset-band over which the asset-ownership is aggregated (see discussion
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The choice exercised by the consumer is that of choosing a particular higher
 non-durable consumption level 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and her asset-ownership level that determines 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 and thus eventually 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is thus set to vary across the population based on 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 (through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 More particularly, the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a lower reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 can be different from that in a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and it is this variation in the two economies that we're interested in
 comparing.

 The issue with this appraoch is that somebody with sigificant assets may
 not record any costs - so costs are always among consumers within certain
 bounds of assets.
 Even if we consider consumers within a certain district, we're saying that
 consumers with no assets also have needs determined by r_t - which is different
 from what we are doing - which is to observe Psi at an individual level
 - much the way A is observed.
 It's probably better to stop keeping Psi dependent on r_t.

\begin_layout Standard
The above equation indicates that the representative household must first
 pay the costs that are imposed on her due to owning a certain level of
 long-term assets (and thereby being in the particular asset-reference group
 of richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) before she may indicate status through non-durable consumption.
 All non-durable consumption excluding cost of assets levied upon the household
 due to her asset-ownership level must encompass all status consumption
 there can be.
 In the context of developing economies, we argue that the non-durable consumpti
on excluding asset-costs would create differences among consumer that would
 be relevant for status.

Apart from the variation depending on the richness value 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

, the avenues for status consumption may vary significantly through the
 differences in consumer baskets across the regions in an economy.
 There are fewer opportunities to avail music CDs or purchase imported foods
 in rural areas with poor access to urban centre.
 For this reason, we also explore how the non-food consumption varies from
 consumption on food across the regions.
 Separating the expenditure food and non-food items as above avoids the
 evident measurement error

% What's not clear is the reason why we are ignoring A on the RHS.
 We're saying that individual consumption levels of non-durable consumption
 should be related to average non-durable consumption and overall assets.
 Using an XT model, one can check whether consumers respond to changes in
 asset values in the area or change in net non-durable consumption (or in
 all consumption).
 A comparison of all consumption vs all non-durable consumption in XT model
 is unnecessary because we assume a cost-structure Psi(r)- suggesting that
 asset-costs are already considered with assets.
 The theoretical justification of the averages are that they are prices
 - of needs (whether basic-food or all-food depends on the availability
 of non-foods prices and the measurement erros by mixing) of asset-maintenance.
 The substitution between asset-costs, needs and nde can be considered -
 so the averages of assets (the role of r), price of needs (average food)
 and (average nde) can then be considered.
 Without AIDS, we can just take q_nde as dependent variable and then consider
 prices (averages) as independent variables.
 Care should be taken on how this corresponds to the model stated in the
 chapter.
 The average of basic-needs + asset costs makes sense, but then we need
 to explain that r_t (price of richness) comprises both of an average needs
 (price) component and an average assets (price) component.
 This also explains that logx - which is not an average and an individual
 value - must remain as independent variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% So in summary, the only substitution we want to present is between nu
 and r_t.
 If we were to use AIDS (let's say), then the weight would be of total asset-cos
ts and nde (not needs).
 The total costs we care about is therefore also just the sum of asset_costs
 (energy, transport) and nu (food, household).
 instead of asset-cost averages we use asset-price-averages and instead
 of price of food+household - we use the total price of food+household (thats'
 the average nde).
 High assets_costs + nu .
 When use q_nde as dependent variable occupation could be used as an instrument.

Non-durable consumption excluding asset-costs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption items in the LSMS survey are classified under four broad
 categories - food, energy, transport and household.
 Except food and household consumption, we consider the expenditure on energy
 and transport as costs of maintaining a certain level of assets (car, refrigera
tor, heater etc.).
 The classification is presented in the Table 
\begin_inset ERT

 for Nigeria.
 The reason for this treatment of asset-bearing costs (e.g.
 energy- and transport-related costs) is merely the avoidance of double-counting
 of the role of assets in status comparisons while considering non-durable
 consumption.
 Consider for example the comparison of statuses for two consumers of which
 only one owns a motorcycle.
 Here, we do not need to compare how much petrol they've purchased when
 we've already taken into account the difference in their transportation-related
 asset(s).
 As energy and transport related assets are already considered as part of
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer, the costs associated with energy and transport must be
 excluded from the notion of non-durable consumption relevant for signaling.
 Thus the only non-food relevant expenditure for status that we measure
 as

The average-costs of food and non-food non-durable consumption excluding
 assets costs in a particular area is determined by simply averaging the
 relevant expenditure in the local area (
\begin_inset Formula $4$

-km radius) surrounding the consumer.
 This is akin to the unit-value method for prices used in the consumer demand
 literature that we use only to observe the average costs for non-durable
 consumption in the consumer's locality.
 The prices or average 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t}),p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 thus calculated are used for the comparison of the effects of local assets
 and local costs of non-durable consumption (both non-food and food) on

 relies on the stock of durable goods owned by every consumer.
 The durable goods recorded in the LSMS survey range from short-term durable
 items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such
 as land or houses.
 Of these, we are interested only in the long-term assets that can be transferre
d over generations - accumulations that encompass the notion of asset-richness.
 The assets transferred over a generation are readily verified by inspecting
 households in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit
 family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-values in the area surrounding
 the consumer - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household).
 Further, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time -
 a feature that makes it more appropriate for a comparison against non-durable
 consumption at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained simply as
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

A more appropriate analysis could use the immediate neighborhood of the
 consumer's wards - but not having the geographic location of the ward (or
 the MTAA field in the survey) limits the granularity of our analysis to
 the district's level.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts where the
 consumes resides in order to define the consumer's vicinity based on a
 Euclidean distance
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Other than the 4-
\begin_inset Formula $km$
\end_inset

 Euclidean radius around the consumer's district, one could consider a populatio
n-adjusted neighborhood metric around the consumer household by incorporating
 the population mass in the consumer's.
 Such a population-adjusted distance -
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta_{AB}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer in district 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 is the Euclidean distance between coordinates for 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}+N_{B}$
\end_inset

 is the population resident with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

- would be shorter for denser areas but larger for sparser populations (represen
ting a smaller reference for consumers despite being spread over a larger
 geographical area).
 We have not however obtained significant differences in the results with
 such a population-adjusted metric after using the census data.
 This could be both because of the coarse granularity of our reference boundarie
s (district level) and the district boundaries already being wider in the
 rural regions (with only a few exceptions such as Sumbawanga and Nkasi
 in Rukwa which we consider within the same reference on grounds of proximity
 in Euclidean distance).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, we infer consumer's asset-richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the logarithm of average market value of assets owned by the consumers
 within the boundary of reference around the consumer (including the district
 which the consumer belongs to) and use the non-durable consumption averages
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$

\end_inset

.
 A constraint that the aggregation into 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and consumption-averages also impose is that the number of observed households
 within the reference boundary should be high enough to average out the
 idiosyncratic effects and issues related to seasonality of data-capture
 (e.g.
 less electricity needed in winter etc.).
 For this reason, we've made sure that no districts with less than 10 observatio
ns per year are included in our analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Empirical Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal of our empirical analysis is to find the extent to which
 the non-durable expenditure excluding asset costs - after accounting for
 income - is influenced by local asset-ownership levels and the local non-durabl
e consumption level in the two countries.
 If only asset-levels determine the non-durable consumption level in an
 economy, then that would imply a segregation of non-durable consumption
 based on asset-richness.
 If on the other hand, the effect of asset-richness on non-durable consumption
 is weak compared to the the local averages of non-durable consumption,
 the non-durable consumption is likely to be driven by the local levels
 of consumption.
 Likewise, when neither the local non-durable consumption averages nor the
 local asset-averages are significant for the individual's consumption after
 accounting for income, then the non-durable consumption is predominantly
 driven by the income of the individual and the different clusters of income
 and assets are spread uniformly across the regions (over which we calculated
 local averages).
 Lastly, when non-durable consumption is influenced both by local asset-averages
 and local-non-durable consumption averages in the local areas then the
 non-durable consumption patterns are clustered both according to levels
 of asset and regional costs of non-durable consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the non-durable items excluding asset-costs that includes both food
 and non-food components.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 comprising of both food and non-food non-durable consumption (i.e.
 food and household expenditures) supports the wide-ranging evidence for
 pressures on food-quality in sub-Saharan countries (see for example Schneider
 et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MastersMalawiFoodQuality2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 When the needs for food quality are not met for the majority of a population,
 social interactions are likely to reveal consumers who can afford better
 food quality from those who can't.
 The attainment of higher food quality would - in other words - be visible
 enough in a poor economy and should be considered a part of non-durable
 consumption relevant for status.
 To take a specific example, when only a small part of the population has
 access to electricity (e.g.
 about 10% in Tanzania), the improvement of food quality through having
 a refrigerator is a luxury that cannot be considered as a mere basic need
 for the consumer.

We use the food and non-food budget shares to understand the role long-term
 assets on non-food non-durable consumption.
 The consumer income used in the analysis is proxied with the total per-expendit
ure including all expenses (asset costs, food, non-food expenses).
 We also see how the total food and non-food non-durable consumption values
 vary across assets.
 Here, as mentioned before, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{food}(r_{t}),p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 are the local averages of food and non-food non-durable expenditures (excluding
 asset costs) in the area surrounding the consumer and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the local asset-ownership level in the area (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have mentioned before, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not include the cost of owning and maintaining assets since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 already includes the contribution of assets to one's status.
 As a consumer does not choose the maintenance of assets separately from
 choosing to purchase the asset, the idea that a representative consumer
 increases her non-durable consumption excluding asset costs (NDCexAC) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 by availing a higher quality or quantity than necessary makes sense only
 if we exclude the costs imposed on the consumer due to having bought certain
 assets (through maintenance, repair, fees etc.) from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The average 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nonfood}(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 thus also excludes the cost of maintaining assets.
 The status advantage that the consumer gets from being in an asset-rich
 neighborhood is meant to be measured with both 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - with a possible substitution between the two.

While the overall poverty levels may be similar in Nigeria and Tanzania,
 the extreme differences in Tanzania (particularly between the south of
 the country and the east) are in contrast with those in Nigeria.
 More specifically, the occupations associated with higher income seem far
 fewer in the hinterland than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In Nigeria (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"

\end_inset

) , on the other hand, the income-disparities in occupations and asset-differenc
es seem less extreme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The range of occupations available to the consumer populations in the surveys
 from Tanzania and Nigeria are varied.
 To compare the role of occupations in the two economies, we standardise
 all the different occupations in the survey for Tanzania and Nigeria into
 occupation ranks ranging from 0 to 3.
 The occupation ranks are essentially based on sorting the varied occupations
 in the two economies by the income of consumers in the respective countries.
 The occupation-ranks mapped from the occupation levels in Tanzania and
 Nigeria are presented in Table

In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The primary reason for this the sparsity of income data.
 In the LSMS data used for Nigeria and Tanzania, the income data is not
 available for the entire survey population.
 This is partly due to significant informal sectors in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table
 
\begin_inset ERT

 for Nigeria).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regional disparities in economic conditions and population density provide
 a particular context to status differences in the economy - as the disparity
 in services as well as amenities across the country have strong implications
 for any consumption deemed status-related.
 A key interpretation of our model for status consumption is that status
 competitions are essentially non-overlapping between two groups of consumers
 when one has both extremely low asset-levels compared to the other and
 extremely low non-durable consumption levels as well.
 In other words, a consumer cannot be in a status competition with another
 consumer when she has both lower level of asset-richness and inferior (or
 deficient) non-durable consumption as well.
 With the south of Tanzania not having nearly the same level of electricity
 consumption nor comparable durable goods associated with electricity as
 the east of Tanzania, the non-durable consumption from the consumers in
 south of Tanzania is hardly in reference to the consumers in urban east
 of Tanzania.
 We use the parametric analysis to test for this effect in Tanzania and
 Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status concerns are necessarily localised, the non-durable consumption
 for consumers in the asset poor south and west are indeed much lower.
 On the other hand, despite lower incomes in the central north, the median
 net-asset worth of the individuals in regions such as Singida and Manyara
 could match up with that of the consumers in the east coast of Tanzania
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r_tn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 With the average asset-values and food average costs relatively more aligned
 in the central and eastern regions, the occupational/asset differences
 and non-durable consumption are more comparable between the two regions
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In Tanzania, where we have data on subjective well-being for individuals,
 we also find that eastern regions have much higher perceptions and non-durable
 consumption excluding asset costs as well as high value of assets compared
 to central areas.
 Still, the consumers in southern regions have relatively higher reported
 satisfaction levels than the centre.
 While poverty may not influence subjective well-being so much in Tanzania,
 it cannot be ruled out that the poor are not in the same status competition
 as the rich.
 Not having a similar detail for Nigeria in the LSMS survey prevents us
 from comparing subjective well being data in the two economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the regional disparities, they appear less extreme in Nigeria even
 though the southern areas of the country seem to have more higher-paid
 occupations and a higher expenditure on non-durable expenditure overall
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:occupations_r_ngr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Despite the differences in educational and occupational levels in between
 the north and south of the country, the disparity in asset ownership is
 not nearly as extreme as in Tanzania.
 The implications of this uniformity on non-durable consumption is discussed
 using a parametric approach in the Section

\begin_inset Formula $w_{nonfood}$
\end_inset

 is more sensitive to assets and occupation rank in Tanzania.
 Higher-asset regions (east of the country) seem to contribute significantly
 to the non-durable consumption share in Tanzania.
 The same effect of

 is seen in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{food}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{nonfood}$
\end_inset

 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In Tanzania, rural consumers spend less portion on non-food while in Nigeria,
 the effect of urban factor variable on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{nonfood}$
\end_inset

 is not significant.
 The same effect is seen for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{nonfood}$
\end_inset

 in both the countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Larger family sizes have both higher non-food proportion and higher absolute
 non-food consumption - possibly indicating expansion of needs with the
 family size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
\size small
age
\family default
\size default
 of the household has a positive effect on the proportion of expenditure
 on food 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{food}$
\end_inset

 in both Tanzania and Nigeria.
 The higher portion of expenditure spent on food spent in families with
 older household-heads (the median household-head age is 43 in Tanzania
 and 48 in Nigeria) may suggest a stronger demand for consumption in families
 with young children (that corresponding higher household head age).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Expensive food regions seem to decrease non-food proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{nonfood}$
\end_inset

 and increase food proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{food}$
\end_inset

.
 This seems to suggest again that food (including its quality) is more important
 to the consumers in both Nigeria and Tanzania than the non-food non-durable
 consumption.
 On the other hand, since expensive non-food regions increase non-food portion
 as well, the consumers with higher non-food expenditure proportion tend
 to be in the same regions.
 Put another way, the expenditure on non-food items is clustered across
 regions in both Nigeria and Tanzania
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%(this effect does get lost when we observe all-nde i.e.
 food + non-food averages/prices

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Given higher income, the per-head non-food consumption proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{nonfood}$
\end_inset

 drops for the consumers in both Tanzania and Nigeria (see the significance

 respectively).
 The significance of non-durable consumption excluding asset costs here
 is different from the typical conditions of a developed economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The role of education ranks seems higher in Tanzania than Nigeria.
 This suggests that consumer lifestyles are more segregated by education
 levels - likely due to individuals with high education levels being limited
 to fewer urban areas in Tanzania.

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_inset Formula $ln(A)$
\end_inset

] For Tanzania, absolute 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not higher for consumers with higher assets but the non-food component
 increases.
 The substitution with assets makes sense because high total expenditure
 is associated with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 but lower 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{non\_food}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
[food-prices effect on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

] Tanzania has far higher economic significance for 
\series bold
food
\series default
-means than non-food averages on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
 For both countries, higher food price (cluster-averages) mean higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and a lower non-food component 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{non\_food}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, for both countries, higher non-food prices (cluster-averages)
 mean higher non-food component and lower food-components - meaning that
 higher non-food prices are clustered in both economies.
 But we also see that the economic significance of food vs non-food averages
 for Tanzania (
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{.184}{.119}$
\end_inset

 ,
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{.160}{.115}$
\end_inset

) is much higher than that of Nigeria (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{.0316}{.0544}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{.0297}{.0277}$
\end_inset

).
 The non-food consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 drops more sharply with non-food averages as food-averages rise in Tanzania.
 This confirms the higher disparity in non-food consumption in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
[occupation rank] The effects of occupation rank and education rank are
 not surprising- better occupation and education ranks tend to spend more
 on non-food components.
 However, the role of education is less in Tanzania - this may point to
 a slightly higher educated population in Tanzania.
 Further, higher occupations have lower per-head non-durable consumption
 for the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 This motivates our rregression for higher and lower sub-samples of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 This may suggest how extreme the segregation of income and thereby of consumpti
on might be.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
[Asset_A0 vs quality] In overall non-durable consumption excluding assets
 costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

), there is some substitution between owning assets and availing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - since consumers with high assets given the same income have less 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 But the non-food portion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is more sensitive to assets in Tanzania - where higher assets mean more
 non-food components whereas the relation is weaker in Nigeria.
 This motivates this regression on higher and lower asset owner populations.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A view of status in terms of non-durable consumption excluding asset costs
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and long-term assets allows us to argue that extreme asset-differences
 may not be overcome with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a status competition.
 More particularly, the extreme differences in assets make status items
 from the richer asset band less appealing for the consumers in the poorer
 band - more so in the absence of opportunities for consumers from different
 asset bands to communicate and engage in status comparisons with each other
 (e.g.
 urban settings, educational, mandatory service etc.) .
 As the extreme differences in assets (that may themselves be to social
 or physical barriers) imply differentiated social contexts, the status
 competitions among consumer groups where extreme asset differences exist
 must undergo a separation of reference groups.
 The segregation of status consumption patterns implied by such a separation
 is what we intend to observe as effects of extreme asset-differences on
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 using the model in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.

% We can also try to answer what luxury items imply for societies where
 there is segregation and where there isn't.
 The latter should have a volatile - but changing environment while the
 former would have a stable market.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If such a segregation dominates, status goods can be hardly said to be relevant
 for the general population in a developing economy.
 Any consumption that can be considered of status value for a significant
 part of the population is ruled out when non-durable consumption is strongly
 segmented across asset-bands.
 To measure this segregation of consumption patterns in empirical terms,
 we have compared the two economies with respect to their 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - which we measure as the non-food portion of the non-durable consumption
 excluding any costs implied by assets.
 These empirical results inspect the extent to which 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 may be segmented by asset-possessions in the two economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the urban settings would always have higher assets and higher non-durable
 consumption opportunities overall, our intention in a cross-country comparison
 is to measure how extreme these differences are in the two economies.
 Asset bands provide us the needed reference-point which we use to argue
 for the presence of a segregation in competitions when asset-differences
 are wide.
 Thus, while status competition are evidently more predominant in cities
 (developing and developed economies alike), the urban-rural differences
 in assets are less extreme in the developed economies and a substitution
 between owning assets and non-durable consumption follows.
 This is less likely in developing economies when there are a significant
 number of households at a subsistence level with very little asset possessions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comparison of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in Tanzania and Nigeria is performed in two parts.
 First, we look at the non-durable consumption measure in the two countries.
 Second, we measure how much the extreme asset differences may influence
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first part of our comparison, we find that the more uniformly distributed
 assets in Nigeria imply that long-term asset ownership has a more significant
 role towards status (in Nigeria).
 Since a significant population in both the economies spends a large portion
 of their budget on food, the overall non-durable consumption is comparable
 for Tanzania and Nigeria.
 But given that status can only achieved through long-term assets and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

, non-durable consumption (including food) is all that may carry some status
 in a population of consumers with no-reported assets (e.g.
 in Tanzania).
 An FE regression for 
\begin_inset Formula $log(q_{ne})$
\end_inset

 (non-durable consumption including both food and non-food nondurable consumptio
n) against 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for panel data households (2010-2012) in Nigeria (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessFENGR}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ) also suggests that as consumers gain more assets they seem to substitute
 with less non-durable consumption in Nigeria.
 The substitution is not as significant in Tanzania (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessFETNZ}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second part we compare the effect of asset-differences on non-durable
 consumption after accounting for occupation and education differences.
 The differences in non-durable consumption between medium occupations and
 low occupations is relatively less.
 While 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is higher for highest occupations for both Nigeria and Tanzania, it is
 more sensitive to asset-accumulation in Tanzania.
 The extreme differences in wealth imply a less overlapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in Tanzania.
 The effect of asset-richness on levels of non-durable consumption and the
 segregation of demand for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 are thus significant in Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude that the effect extreme asset-differences in a developing economy
 too often come with significant differences in non-durable consumption
 as well - underpinning a separation  of demand for non-durable consumption
 above needs that may indicate status.
 The utility of goods for status consumption under extreme income differences
 may therefore be little when the non-durable consumption is segregated
 by wide asset level differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, it is worth emphasising that above conclusions are drawn for
 a given level of granularity of aggregation.
 The income and occupation differences within groups finer than the district
 level aggregation might show more detailed variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 consumption across income levels but our interpretations with district-level
 aggregations have been concerned with the effect of wider regional disparities
 on status consumption in the economies.
 We have used the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 to consider the effect of urban and rural disparities on non-durable consumptio
n since we find the extreme urban-rural differences more relevant to status
 competitions in the developing economies than the consumption visible goods
 which are limited to a small urban population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this context, we summarise two key findings from above analyses.
 First, that the extreme differences do limit status consumption.
 Second, that a comparison of status consumption as expenditure on non-durable
 visible items is rather incomplete without an overview of differences in
 long-term asset possessions that are particularly extreme in developing
 economies.
 These differences we believe - should be considered in the measurement
 of status consumption in developing economies.

 Interpretations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 1.
 C5 says that higher price-non-food-expenditure suppresses w_food (individuals
 would decrease w_food when there is higher non-food area - so they move
 together with the food consumption).
 higher-price-food-expenditure on the other hand increases food weight (meaning
 consumers run to food when prices are higher).
 C6 suggests that consumers run to food more easily in TNZ - thus indicating
 more non-durable consumption in Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 2.
 C3 says that older households have higher food consumption.
 C7 means that bigger households tend to have lower w_food than smaller
 households.
 Younger households have less w_food - meaning more non-durable consumption
 among younger people in both countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 3.
 D5 says high-food-expenditure-regions have lower non-durable consumption
 (again because food is more important).
 D5 also says that high-non-food-expenditure regions have a positive influence
 so the consumption does move together for non-food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% 4.
 D2 says that asset-differences have a -ve influence on w_nonfood.
 Richer areas suppress non-food expenditure a lot in Tanzania.
 Urban areas actually push people to food.
