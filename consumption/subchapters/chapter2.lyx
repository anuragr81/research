\begin_layout Title
Status consumption and intertemporal substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Status consumption is known to be ubiquitous but the role of wealth inequalities
 in status consumption is less understood in the varied contexts of developing
 countries.
 We develop a model for status consumption based on the intertemporal consumer
 choice where status is viewed as part of the consumer's utility.
 The utility function used in the model comprises of both quality in non-durable
 consumption and owned durable goods.
 Using the data on durable goods ownership available in the Tanzanian LSMS
 consumption microdata, we discuss how a segregation of quality may characterise
 status consumption in a developing economy..

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent research suggests an ubiquity of status-related consumption and the
 relevance of peer effects in consumer demand

.
 One expects therefore that regardless of how poor an economy is, the consumers
 would maintain a consumption level relative to their reference group level.
 At an aggregate level, however, a disproportionate demand for items which
 identify the rich consumers (i.e.
 conspicuous consumption) must also depend on the age-composition of the
 consumer population as well as the degree to which the consumers are segregated
 in an economy.
 An insufficient communication amongst the reference groups imposed by region
 or social barriers - could create segregated reference groups and may cause
 the demand for conspicuous goods to be completely absent for some significant
 reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, if the poor in an economy are far too many, the poor majority
 may neither observe nor emulate the lifestyles of a rich microscopic minority.
 Such dependence of status consumption on poverty levels has been only partly
 explored by the studies on effects of income inequality on conspicuous
 consumption

 who observe visible consumption in the regions of erstwhile East and West
 Germany after the economic liberalisation at the end of cold war to test
 if prolonged measures of suppressed incomes can influence visible consumption
 when the incomes rise with economic changes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In the current chapter, we view status consumption as a combination of
 expensive durable goods and high-quality non-durable consumption - comparing
 the two amongst consumers spread across different age-groups and levels
 of urbanisation.
 To endogenise the role of long-term durable goods and personal characteristics
 in status, we use an intertemporal model of consumer choice for status
 consumption.
 The composition of the population and the segregation of quality are viewed
 as life-cycle effects in this intertemporal model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The view of status as social deference has often been embraced in economics

\end_inset

 - so that it is simply a ranking order in a population of consumers.
 Since the role of status consumption is to influence such a ranking, we
 argue that the status for a consumer with a fixed set of personal characteristi
cs can only be improved either with quality in non-durable consumption or
 with long-term durable goods (including only the durable goods that can
 be part of inter-generational transfers).
 Further, the quality in non-durable consumption may be driven by a certain
 myopia through immediate needs while the consumption of durable goods is
 likely to be driven by the consumer's long-term concerns.
 Thus in an intertemporal model for consumer choice, the representative
 consumer is meant to optimise a utility based on the owned durable goods
 and the quality of non-durable consumption (with a given set of skills
 and characteristics she has acquired over generations).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the conventional demand analysis, the sense of quality is often interpreted
 from an aggregation of items over commodities as separable groups

.
 As the theoretical requirements for such an aggregation require a detailed
 set of market prices of goods within every commodity
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonQualityQuantityVariation,NelsonQualityQuantity"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the view of status consumption as high-quality consumption is often hampered
 with a lack of information on brand/type variety in the typical consumption
 survey.
 To circumvent this issue, the studies on conspicuous consumption often
 focus on a particular instance of status consumption - comprising of (visible)
 goods that are meant to be futile for the general needs of the consumer.
 The futility of status goods ensures the separability of demand for visible
 goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argue that the futility assumption cannot be made in severely unequal
 societies where wealth differences may be far too wide to be narrowed with
 visible (or high quality) non-durable consumption.
 In other words, since status consumption comprises both of quality across
 commodities and ownership of durable goods in our model, the contribution
 of durable goods to the ranking order might dominate any changes with visible
 (high quality) non-durable consumption.
 Evaluating this framework in the particular case of Tanzania, we discuss
 how quality in non-durable consumption is segregated by personal characteristic
s (e.g.
 education) and availability of certain durable goods.
 The consideration of wealth - which we proxy with durable goods in the
 data - provide us the means to identify status consumption in a developing
 economy and allows us to measure its significance in an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
our goal is to extend this model to other countries - without running into
 the issues of visibility surveys - and avoiding being limited to visible
 consumption.
 The eventual goal is to have a framework to test whether status consumption
 is significant in an economy - and more importantly, how would it vary
 between the developed and developing economies.

 Around the time when Marx had endorsed a view of all commodities as products
 of labour (diamond and corn alike), Veblen seemed to have explored the
 psychological basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 At times, his view of status consumption may appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 - but Veblen hardly dwells upon the equivalence of labour for exchange
 of commodities.
 While he marks the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves from
 physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself into
 a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in the culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism - he argued - is inherent in all exchange of goods and services
 (including devotion and education

Assisted with the developments in econometrics and game theory, an interest
 in Veblen's observations has been revived in the recent years just as the
 quality of microdata from consumption surveys has also improved (see Frank

 This recent attention to status consumption however, need not be viewed
 asunder from the literature on habit-formation in consumer demand (see

 for the classical treatment of quality and cost-of-living indices).
 The framework with lagged consumption - that has been enhanced with life-cycle
 assumptions - can be used to view status consumption as a generalised inertia
 in moving away from a state of quality in consumption - a tendency that
 may in turn be determined by the long-term characteristics such as social
 identity or education.
 This approach has been extended by a few behavioural economics approaches
 that assume some simple mental accounting rules followed by the consumer.
 A key goal of such descriptive models has been to explain the over-spending
 (consumption above necessities) observed in consumer data.
 Such behavioural models improve upon the rational consumer assumptions
 where a consumer is subservient to her optimised plan for life-cycle savings
 and consumption (see Shefrin-Thaler

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a different thread, the relevance of social identities in consumption
 habits has been more directly explored by the literature on status-signalling.
 Empirical studies in both the developed world and the developing countries
 find social group identities relevant to status-related consumption (see

 The literature on marketing also finds the role of durable goods ownership
 in formation of identities (see Corneo 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 We believe it is possible to link the threads of identity and habit formation
 if the role of social identity and ranking could be endogenised in an intertemp
oral setting with a substitution between the consumer's long-term and short-term
s goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intertemporal setting also emphasises the need to tread with caution
 when looking at demand of items in the developing countries that are considered
 conspicuous in the developed countries.
 As the relative wealth differences are more relevant (visible) for status
 differences in the developing countries where industrial development is
 concentrated into fewer urban areas, the wealth differences could have
 far more weight for status than the limited range of status items available
 to a consumer in the developing world

.
 On the other hand, rapid industrialisation and a transformation of consumer
 markets in many developing countries could result in a narrowing of income
 differences and creation of new markets for status.
 Without considering the combined effect of wealth difference and non-durable
 consumption as well as a a definition of what may constitute status consumption
 across varied cultural context, it is difficult to draw conclusions on
 how much status consumption matters to the consumer in an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can hardly say that status goods are unimportant in the developing countries.
 Many sociological studies have hinted at the use of industrial goods in
 signalling status as the agrarian societies undergo industrialisation (see

 In post-feudal societies all over the world where consumer markets have
 developed, a new working class that has replaced the feudal or colonial
 order of the century before - tends to break ground with new products for
 status comparisons.
 While Veblen consumption does thrive under such conditions, the relevance
 of severe and widespread income inequalities prevalent in the developing
 countries cannot be fully discarded (Khamis et al.

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The questions in the consumer survey (which is how a researcher may obtain
 the list of visible items) may need to be adjusted to include items that
 may indicate wealth.
 This is because the criteria of what items are of visible importance is
 not enough for identifying status consumption in an environment where wealth
 differences are both wide and visible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To quantify the combined effect of wealth and consumption on one's status
 or answer the more difficult question of whether a certain level of prosperity
 (or other societal conditions which establish an achievable reference level
 necessary consumption) is required for status consumption to exist, we
 must define what constitutes status in a society.
 Taking cue from the literature on social deference (see Coleman
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and Corneo et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 who use a ranking of consumers based on their incomes and consumption in
 their model for snob and bandwagon items), we view status as a ranking
 order over the consumers in an economy - so that a consumer achieves status
 utility through consumption by moving herself up in this ranking order
 - determined by wealth and income that is visible to other consumers in
 the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The literature on status consumption also suggests that that the fulfilment
 of needs alone cannot offer any ranking or status advantage (see Galbraith
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GalbraithAffluent"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 At an empirical level, therefore a notion of status consumption must rely
 on reference levels in two ways.
 First is the set of needs above which all else can be considered excess
 consumption relevant for status.
 Since most of empirical data is gathered at household levels, the larger
 households having more needs would require the consumption data to be scaled
 by the number of members.
 One must standardise the basic needs of a household to establish such a
 reference level.
 Second is the local social reference levels for status consumption.
 If the choice consumer faces is to either save for future or spend on status
 goods, she is likely to be concerned with the rich consumption in her immediate
 social surroundings rather than a distant (possibly richer) consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our view, both reference levels i.e the necessities and social group consumpti
on level are important for an empirical measurement of status consumption.
 Since a measurement of necessities is often sidelined in the literature,
 the studies on conspicuous consumption make varied assumptions about what
 to include as part of conspicuous consumption and what not to.
 Some studies, for example, include long-term durable goods (e.g.
 housing) in the status-related items while others don't.
 In some cases, studies employ a consumer basket identified from a different
 economy on the basis of items being of conspicuous value by common knowledge.
 Except when a survey is used to identify visible consumption, the contents
 of the consumer basket for conspicuous consumption tend to have items that
 are just commonly understood to have some signaling value (jewelry etc.
 that were first identified by Charles et al.

\begin_layout Standard
A promising approach is followed by visibility surveys (see Heffetz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

) which provide the means to get around the problem of a definition of needs.
 The survey approach to classification of status items also lends itself
 to tractable models (e.g.
 those provided by Ireland

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Assuming that conspicuous consumption brings no utility in the regular sense
 - an argument often attributed to Veblen - the utility for visible consumption
 can be considered separable (additively) from the utility for non-visible
 consumption (the futility assumption).
 This permits the empirical analyses to lump together the demand for conspicuous
 items into one good.
 We do not find futility assumption plausible for the data we observe in
 the developing countries.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Despite this much desired tractability, we favour an approach where snob
 and bandwagon behaviour form the fundamental mechanisms for status consumption.
 This latter approach allows us to include wealth differences and the quality
 in a general intertemporal setting for a developing economy that we use
 to model status consumption 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The mutually opposing mechanisms that Veblen defined were pecuniary emulation
 and invidious comparison - indicating the trends in consumption where the
 not-so rich may emulate the rich (pecuniary emulation) or show to the poor
 that they belong to a club that poor don't (invidious comparison).
 While these could be related to snob and bandwagon behaviours (see Corneo
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We believe that such a model would be more generic for it to be applied
 across multiple economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The social (second) reference level for status consumption - which can tracked
 with consumption in one's immediate surroundings - can standardise the
 demand for status across economies.
 This framework has been successfully employed in many studies on status
 consumption.

 If personal characteristics were fixed, there is no consumption other than
 that on durable goods or on non-durable consumption that the consumer can
 engage in to change her social ranking.
 Status consumption - in this sense - comprises of i) everything that is

 maintaining the durable goods.

 for examples).
 In the context of status consumption on the other hand, since a consumer
 is supposed to achieve a utility from status consumption, the status of
 the consumer must also comprise of non-durable consumption.
 Further, if there is any status related utility to be derived from non-durable
 consumption, it would be constituted in the felicity from 
\shape italic
relative 
\shape default
quality (which is defined as distance from needs observed within a particular
 reference group).
 This is because the consumer with a habit of

relative 
\shape default
high-quality in consumption (or deriving higher felicity above the fulfillment
 of needs) would 
\shape italic
ceteris paribus

have higher status than another consumer consuming less quality.
 The fulfillment of consumer needs - which are the same for every one -
 does not carry an influence on status.
 It also follows that any status that is not signaled with quality in non-durabl

To clarify the terminology, our notion of quality as excess consumption
 is different from that in the demand literature on quality which relies
 on market-prices and quantity consumed.
 When these are observed (as is often the case for food), quality is simply
 the proportion of expensive items standardised by quantity

 However, when quantities consumed and the details prices aren't available,
 a notion of quality must rely on the cost of a standard basket of basic

 Empirically, such a notion of quality in non-durable consumption must also
 exclude the costs incurred by owning durable goods.
 Without such an adjustment, the costs that the owner of a refrigerator
 or a large house (for example) has to bear may also appear as quality in
 non-durable consumption.
 To compare the quality in consumption of someone who owns a long-term durable
 good with someone who doesn't, one must therefore adjust for the costs
 that are incurred by the owner of the durable good.
 Since the consumer achieves a

 of cost of owning durable-goods from quality in non-durable consumption

The measurement of ownership of long-term durable goods is relatively easier
 - as we consider long-term durable goods as only those that can be passed

The second reference level

 - includes peer effects by adjusting quality relative to the reference
 group's consumption level (i.e.
 the consumption in the immediate surroundings e.g.
 a locality, a relevant social group, income or owner group of the durable
 goods etc.).
 Instead of calculating the average of quality consumption over the reference
 groups, we only consider the characteristics over which the average would
 be calculated.
 If the individuals with ownership of expensive durable goods tend to live
 in a region different than where those with low ownership of durable goods
 reside, being a resident of the community of owners of expensive durable
 goods already carries some status.
 This avoids the double-counting of characteristics much the same way adjusting
 for costs of durable goods avoids double counting of quality in non-durable
 consumption (See more details in Section

In contrast to the visible consumption models, we are more interested in
 the effects of wealth and characteristics such as residence or social identity
 on status-related consumption rather than the demand for items that are
 known 
\shape italic

 to have some status carrying potential.
 To compare the two approaches, consider an analogy of a market for cars
 where status is signalled through car ownership.
 While the visible consumption approach may find that the consumers pay
 more attention to the outward appearance of their car (the body work, paint,
 rims etc.
 - which definitely futile) rather than the interior (engine cleaning, quality
 of tyres etc.), our approach considers i) the price differences in the cars
 being sold in the market (quality) and the ii) constraints on occupation
 and income that exist in the population (wealth).
 We believe that the latter approach may provide more insights in the status
 consumption the developing countries where visible consumption is not all
 what status-related consumption over time may comprise of.
 It is worth emphasising that not all high quality consumption is visible.
 Some higher quality non-durable consumption (such as using electricity
 in a developing country) may not be visible in nature but must accompany
 higher durable consumption that may in turn be visible (electrical equipment
 etc.).
 Similarly, while a visible item is effectively a high-quality item (since
 visibility is priced in the market), not all visible consumption (consider
 a cheap watch) may qualify as high quality consumption either
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Visible consumption could be considered in the framework as long it is viewed
 in relation to the ownership of durable goods or long-term wealth.
 If the consumer preferences for needs across different commodity groups
 and the durable goods she acquires are considered, visibility through non-durab
le consumption (i.e.
 visible consumption) can be seen as a preference order for quality across
 the groups.
 More particularly, as prices of commodities change or new goods are introduced,
 the consumer may adjust her quality of non-durable consumption (once her
 needs are met) based on a preference order over the commodity groups (a
 consumer may consider quality for transport more important than quality
 in food or vice versa).
 In this sense, the commodities such as food are less visible than household
 or entertainment.

In summary, the model we choose for long-term and short-term consumer needs
 does not view status consumption as futile but relates it with measures
 of wealth.
 Status may not be changed by fulfillment of basic needs but is influenced
 both by long-term possessions and non-durable consumption in an intermporal
 setting that we use to understand the status consumption in an economy.

Status as utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to state one assumption which much of the model could follow
 from, it would be that status is constituted in the consumer's long-term
 utility.
 If not, the model's representative consumer would have no reason to engage
 in status-related consumption in any form.
 As there is something to be gained - however little - from non-durable
 status-consumption (otherwise consumers would know of its futility), a
 consumer can a achieve higher status in the model not only by the acquisition
 of durable goods (which is assisted with higher income) but also by the
 status promotion through consumption (which may enhance social interactions
 and improve self-image)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is worth clarifying that the consumer utility inclusive of status is
 not meant to describe consumer's beliefs.
 As non-durable consumption is myopic (i.e.
 it represents consumer's short term concerns) and savings cumulative (represent
s consumer's long term concerns), the status utility derived from quality
 in non-durable consumption in the model only differentiates the consumer's
 utility from long-term determinants of status (ownership of long-term durable
 goods and personal characteristics such as education).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The role of non-durable consumption is therefore two-fold in the model
 - first, it addresses the immediate needs of the consumer and second, it
 also matches the high-quality consumption with status-related goals.
 Quality or expensive non-durable consumption provides both felicity in
 the present as well as a possible status advantage - since all else being
 the same, someone consuming a higher quality is likely to have more status
 than someone consuming a lower quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may appear that viewing status consumption as a general higher-quality
 consumption in this manner either trivialises or undervalues conspicuous
 consumption.
 A lot of discussion on conspicuous consumption in the public discourse
 does tend to present it as a phenomenon that only-serves-the-rich.
 Thus even though few would doubt that a conspicuous items are used both
 to distance oneself from the others and to emulate the behaviour of those
 above oneself, there is a tendency to focus more on its wastefulness amongst
 the rich than its utility to the middle classes.
 The view of conspicuous consumption as a means to distinguish oneself from
 one's own reference group must imply a more general appeal for status consumpti
on.
 As status consumption only comprises of durable goods and expensive non-durable
 consumption, all signaling benefits and the improvement of one's perceived
 status must also be a part of the utility comprised of quality in non-durable
 consumption and durable goods.
 One may argue against status consumption being limited to the rich also
 by highlighting that the status utility to the rich is very little given
 that she may already has enough to distance herself from others.
 Except for indicating a membership to the club of its owners, the marginal
 utility a conspicuous item offers to the rich consumer who may have just
 fallen short of means to signal her wealth is much less than what it may
 offer to the believers of social mobility who are trapped in an environment
 of lower ownership of durable goods.
 The argument that views conspicuous consumption as only serving the rich
 may rule out conspicuous consumption by the poorest who don't have anyone
 else to leave behind (much the way the richest don't need to leave anyone
 behind).
 However, even the poorest may want to indicate that they are not the poorest
 - much the way the richest may want it to be known to the others that they
 are indeed the richest

 The factors such as skills, education, class, identity etc.
 also contribute to the consumer's wealth.
 These characteristics -denoted with

 The non-durable consumption

 is seen as the sum of the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$

Notice that relying only on the total costs associated with a commodity
 (i.e.
 without using the quantity consumed), this notion of quality or 
\shape italic
excess 
\shape default
cannot differentiate between the consumption of a higher quantity and of
 a higher quality.
 Consider for example, a household with a single member having consuming
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 for a commodity priced 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 If the minimum requirement for basic needs is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=p_{1}q_{0}$
\end_inset

, then our quality metric for the consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{p_{1}q_{0}}=\frac{q_{1}}{q_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the individual's household, consuming more quantity than the minimum
 may increase the measure of quality much the way it would if she had switched
 to a better quality.
 As the consumption surveys often don't record the quantity consumed for
 non-food commodities e.g.
 clothing, toiletries etc.
 (nor the associated brand information), there is no way for us to distinguish
 between over-consumption and high-quality consumption by relying solely
 on the total consumption on the good (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\cdot q=\sum_{i}p_{i}q_{i}=x$
\end_inset

).
 That said, as we do know whether the range of goods within a commodity
 are available in the region or not, it is possible to draw conclusions
 about over-consumption and higher-quality consumption for a group of consumers
 - separated by region or other characteristics - who face different ranges
 of goods available within a commodity (more so when a pseudo-panel analysis
 is used).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The reference point of needs is crucial to our notion of quality as it
 is simply a measure of how far in price the consumption is from the local
 cost of reference level needs.
 For food commodities, standardising a set of needs general across the populatio
n is relatively easy - as the cost of needs in food would simply be the
 cost of the cheapest option for proteins, carbs, fruits etc.
 at the minimum subsistence level in the local area for the total number
 of households in the family

 however, the ideas of health and autonomy (see Section

 items as basic needs.
 Considering the commodities food, energy, transport and household
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A different set of categories could be chosen for another consumption dataset.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for example, what constitutes a basic house or a basic set of furniture
 requires some justification based on a cultural or geographic context.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standardising needs in terms of the quantity of non-durable consumption
 poses yet another issue - since the non-durable consumption may depend
 on the long-term durable goods that the consumer possesses.
 In the household category for example, a consumer with more electrical
 equipment would need more electricity and thus a high non-durable consumption
 (while the consumer that does not own any electrical goods would not have
 the respective non-durable consumption).
 We get around this issue and solve the problem with standardisation of
 durable goods as needs by considering an extended set of necessities that
 are inclusive of the constraints imposed by the ownership of durable goods.
 This means that the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is changed corresponding to the particular level of durable goods ownership
 that every consumer has.
 We argue that counting the durable-goods-bearing costs as necessities makes
 more sense than counting it as quality of consumption.
 This is because the latter choice would double-count the utility that the
 consumer gets from the durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 To explain this with an example, consider a consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 with a refrigerator and another consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 without a refrigerator who both have the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 set all non-durable consumption.
 The consumer who doesn't have a refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

) has more to spend on food quality since she does not need to pay the maintenan
ce or electricity costs for the refrigerator (
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{R'}<\Psi_{R}\Rightarrow c_{t}-\Psi_{R'}>c_{t}-\Psi_{R}$
\end_inset

) .
 Does the higher quality of food through higher expenditure by 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 imply a higher overall quality in non-durable consumption for 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

? Not necessarily.
 First, because the outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the same for both 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Second, the overall quality does not simply add up over multiple commodity
 groups (over energy or durable goods for example).
 In fact, there is little sense in claiming that the quality in one commodity
 can be substituted with quality in another.
 The idea of overall quality is meaningless unless one considers the cost
 of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The notion of excess is thus the only way to assess overall quality in
 non-durable consumption.
 If having a refrigerator is not considered a need, then we may say nothing
 more than that 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

 spends more on food quality than 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 has more durable goods than 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

.
 By avoiding counting maintenance costs in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, we merely maintain that interpretation
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is possible that ownership of some durable goods generates some rental
 income.
 Although we haven't found the significance of such income in the consumption
 data, such income would be considered an additional stream of income instead
 of reduction in the cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In other words, the measure of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is thus conditioned for such costs in order to avoid the double-counting
 the durable-goods owner advantage by differencing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 inclusive of the costs of maintaining durable goods from 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

The inclusion of more durable goods is straightforward with this approach.
 Consider for example, how car ownership could be introduced in the above

An alternative to including the durable-goods-bearing costs instead of adjusting
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is to view the owners and non-owners of durable goods as separate reference
 groups.
 This is akin to considering owners of durable goods as separate peer groups
 - the averages over which would be considered as different quality levels.
 This approach has its advantages but since the number of durable goods
 to be considered are likely to be high - one may not have enough data within
 every durable good owner group for the empirical analysis to follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter approach is however the only option available when unlike with
 the case for owned durable good we don't observe the direct costs associated
 with a long-term choice e.g.
 that of residence or education (part of the the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 If someone moves to an expensive neighborhood, then their consumption is
 likely to change in accordance with neighbours.
 Other than the prices, there is no direct constraint imposed on the consumer
 - except through the herd behaviour inherent in residing in an expensive
 neighbourhood.
 In such cases, considering different groups based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is feasible as well since the number of characteristics are likely to be
 limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above clears up an empirical distinction between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 - for some characteristics such as education may be viewed as assets that
 require an investment and have a value in the employment market.
 A long-term choice should be considered as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in the model only as long as the costs of maintenance can be included in
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
 If not, then the long-term choice must be considered as part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (an educated individual is not required to pay a maintenance fee for having
 been educated).
 The empirical method for adjusting necessities based on the durable goods
 one possesses is straightforward if we assume a typical usage for all expensive
 durable goods owned.
 If a household possesses a car, then the needs of the household would be
 incremented with the petrol consumption per year and maintenance for a
 typical usage.
 This also means that some costs of needs (e.g.
 for food) are multiplied by the number of household members in the family
 while other needs aren't - as we obtain the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for a particular household (see Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical distinction between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 may also require some clarification as it is not always obvious if a certain
 cheaper durable goods such as appliances should be considered as part of
 quality in non-durable consumption instead.
 For reasons that'll become clear in the discussion of the intertemporal
 setting in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

, a durable good is considered part of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (and thus its cost of maintenance are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) if it can be passed through generations.
 The durable goods that cannot be passed through generations are not considered
 long-term and excluded from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 ( this is due to the life-cycle considerations that are later explained
 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, if quality is measured as the distance from cost of needs,
 the sunken cost that the owner of a durable good incurs due to ownership
 may imply that quality in non-durable consumption necessarily together
 with ownership of durable goods.
 This is no longer necessary if one considers the costs associated with
 durable goods as part of the cost of necessities.
 Notice that this does not interfere with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 moving together with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 due to consumer's demand.
 More specifically, even after costs of ownership of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are deducted from non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a period (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}=c_{t}-\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) the quality demanded 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 could move together with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 in a population of consumers also because 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 may not be improved beyond a certain point until 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 too is increased.
 For example, in the household category, high prices of housing may encourage
 the consumer to upgrade accessories such as furniture (thus increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

) but she may only improve the overall quality instead of buying a bigger
 house only until a certain point - beyond which she may need a bigger house
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) to improve the furniture etc.
 (thus being encouraged to save for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 again).
 The consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is thus likely to move together with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that the consumer acquires.
 Inclusion of maintenance costs in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not interfere with this co-movement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a co-movement is likely in demand and would result in a limited substitutio
n between quality and durable goods.
 The limited substitution between durable goods and non-durable consumption
 thus allows us to express the consumer utility as an additive function
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon=f(A)+g(\Psi)+m(\nu)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are the durable goods owned, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 the cost of needs (or a scale of needs) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 the quality of non-durable consumption.
 The co-movement of quality and durable goods also means that the quality
 differences in the durable goods can be ignored if the quality in non-durable
 consumption is already being considered.
 A high-quality durable goods is therefore merely a more expensive durable
 good in the consumer's utility
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although not used in the current analysis, the price derivatives can readily
 enter the utility model if the price of needs and quality can be estimated.
 Consider first an environment of without price changes.
 Here, the consumption of quality would change only when individuals acquire
 long-term durable goods or give up hopes of acquiring costlier durable
 goods (possibly due to other needs).
 As the consumer would not sacrifice needs to purchase quality, a rise in
 quality must come either from an increase in income or from an undercut
 in savings.
 Similarly, if needs stay the same, a drop in quality must be due to purchase
 of durable goods or a drop in income.
 Empirically, the prices are attached with a commodity rather than overall
 quality.
 So, to consider price changes, one must consider the price of needs as
 well as the price of quality across the various commodities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Faced with change in prices, a consumer may prefer quality in one commodity
 over another (i.e.
 a consumer may switch consumption on quality from transport to food or
 vice versa) as she addresses her needs and long-term durable goods requirements.
 To illustrate this with an example, consider a middle-income family that
 moves to a cheaper neighbourhood where the rents are lower but the restaurants
 are fewer.
 The consumption on fine-dining options - which signaled status and improved
 self-image - can no longer take place.
 One way to view this change in the consumer's circumstances is to observe
 that the price of entertainment services are lower for the consumer in
 the new neighborhoods.
 Assuming the needs of the family (indicated by the number of family members)
 haven't changed, the consumption would either shift to saving for a better
 car or improve quality in some other category (better jewelry, better schooling
 for kids etc.) in response to price changes or a equivalent changes in income.
 The sensitivity of consumption with respect to price thus comprises of
 sensitivity with respect to basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial c_{t}}{\partial\Psi_{t}}$
\end_inset

as well as a sensitivity with respect to quality for each commodity

 The assumed structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\upsilon(\Psi,\nu,A)$
\end_inset

 implies that a consumer could achieve the same utility - inclusive of status
 - as that of a consumer with a higher education or higher durable goods
 ownership (higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) by raising her excess non-durable consumption (or quality).
 This would accommodate the likely clusters of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 associated with a characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (e.g education, housing, identity, region or barriers owing to segregation,
 trade barriers etc.).
 In other words, a peer effects approach is readily incorporated in the
 model (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for details ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that status is not considered a need using this
 approach.
 Instead, it is inherent in the consumer's demand for quality and the level
 of durable goods ownership she achieves while her basic needs are independent
 of her wealth.
 The aggregate sense of status through consumption is derived by both expensive
 durable goods and quality (across all commodities) - driven by wealth and
 income of the consumer (rather than high-class or low-class needs of the
 consumer).
 As an example, the difference between the status of a rich and that of
 a poor family in our model is not through disparate educational needs of
 the rich and poor children but instead through a more general need for
 the family combined with a demand for quality for education (with a higher
 price for higher quality).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consideration of a consumer's wealth - which separate the rich and non-rich
 consumers - is assumed to be encompassed by the accumulated durable (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) and long-term characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (education, occupation or social identity) in the model.
 The ownership of durable goods is modeled with an asset account - whose
 value is reflected in the total cost of durable goods.
 The use of such an asset account implies that no distinction is made between
 the accumulation of cash reserved to purchase durable goods and the actual
 purchase of durable goods.
 Thus if a consumer sets her eyes on durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (that have prices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}<\Pi_{B}$
\end_inset

) and the value of her cash account at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}=\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

, then the model does not distinguish between the case when she buys the
 durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (price 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

) and the case when she forgoes the purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to save for the future purchase of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 ( since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{B}>\Pi_{A}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to view the asset account is to consider that all long-term
 durable goods in the economy are managed by a large firm (owing its success
 to preferences being the same for everybody) that provides furniture, housing
 and all amenities at a flat upfront cost.
 Every durable goods  and service - offered as a life-long subscription
 - can be purchased by giving an amount to this company.
 We also assume that at the of the lifetime of a consumer, her personal
 wealth would either be consumed or would be passed on to her progeny so
 that the asset account at the end of the lifetime becomes starting wealth
 of some other household(s) in the economy.
 Consequently, while all individuals in the population are assumed to be
 the same as our representative consumer in terms of the preferences for
 needs over quality, they do differ in the the starting amount of their
 asset accounts as well as the trends of their salaries.
 The quality habits of quality (
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
) depend on these long-term characteristics.
 If a consumer has a starting income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{0}$
\end_inset

 and her salary after 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 years of working is 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 then at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, she could have purchased some long-term durable-goods from a portion of
 her income - deciding that she does not want more durable goods for the
 rest of her life.
 Alternatively, she could have experienced a change in the life-circumstances
 (needing a bigger or a more expensive house) thus needing more durable
 goods urgently.
 The consumption in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would therefore depend on the needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, asset account value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and the consumption of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Due to the minimal presence of credit facilities in the developing countries,
 we assume a negligible credit in the market.
 This in turn implies that the consumer can only save to buy more of the
 only durable goods available in the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To separate the measures of wealth from the long-term characteristics that
 drive the household income, we use an income process that is estimated
 exogenously.
 Unlike in PIH, the accumulation of long-term durable goods have an influence
 on the substitution between savings and quality in the intertemporal setting
 we have chosen.
 What this means empirically is that while the exogenous income process
 may depend on education or occupation levels, the effect that long-term
 characteristics have on consumption are not necessarily through income
 but through the constraints associated with levels of durable goods ownership.
 As the effects of on consumption are modeled explicitly, it would suffice
 if the income process models only the monetary growth i.e.
 a reflection of the steady growth in the economy on the consumer's budget
 (in analysis of the Tanzanian data in the current chapter, an income process
 dependent on long-term characteristics such as education and occupation
 is assumed).

Dynamic Optimisation Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By definition of the needs, a consumer is meant to select a quality control
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 only after her basic needs and those imposed by the owned durable goods
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 are fulfilled.
 As stated earlier, the control for quality (
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) is simply the distance in terms of money from the cost of needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the household.
 The higher its value, higher would be the distance from needs consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 (and lower would be the future growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Other than the control 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

, the consumption depends both on needs and the long-term choices of the
 consumer (which are encapsulated by 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 the consumer has accumulated in the past and the the personal characteristics
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 she possesses).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-durable costs imposed by the durable goods one possesses (e.g.
 fuel for cars, electricity for heating equipment, rent/maintenance-fees
 for housing etc.) imply either that avoiding the respective expenses is
 not an option for the consumer owning some durable goods or that some certain
 long-term choices or characteristics (e.g.
 not having a house or living in a region that doesn't have electricity
 available) would limit the choice to avail quality through non-durable
 consumption.
 As discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:MeasuringNQA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the extended necessities of the consumer as she acquires durable goods
 are considered the part of needs cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The effect of any supply-related asymmetries in the data e.g.
 lack of availability of certain goods in a certain region etc.
 are all accommodated in the costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 Given a utility function over quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 a consumer is set to optimise the combined utility over the period of her
 life-time by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in every period as her income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 changes and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 change.
 The intertemporal substitution between durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 imply that a consumer may want to save for durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 or consumer more on short-term quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest instance of intertemporal substitution is a two period model
 where durable goods are meant to be liquidated at the end of the second
 period.
 We choose this model as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
u_{1}=a_{1}log(\Psi_{1})+blog(A_{0})+(1-a_{1}-b)log(\nu_{1})\label{eq:twoperiodoptim}\\
u_{2}=a_{2}log(\Psi_{2})+blog(A_{1})+(1-a_{2}-b)log(\nu_{2})\nonumber 
\end{gather}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1},\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 are consumption on quality in periods 1 and 2 respectively while 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0},A_{1}$
\end_inset

 are value of durable goods at start of the periods.
 Notice that the utility of long-term durable goods is not supposed to change
 for the consumer over her life-time.
 In a typical solution of the intertemporal problem, the wealth constraint
 for the optimisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $U=u_{0}+u_{1}$
\end_inset

 would consider the final 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 all of the consumer's durable goods being liquidated and consumed in the
 last period) and the discounting rate based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 However, since we observe the change in asset account at every period in
 our model, we take a slightly different approach with a dynamic optimisation
 formulation and write the growth of durable goods as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
A_{1}=A_{0}(1+r)+i_{1}-\nu_{1}-\Psi_{1}\\
A_{2}=A_{1}(1+r)+i_{2}-\nu_{2}-\Psi_{2}
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above signifies that the consumer may consume quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{3...}$
\end_inset

 being undefined) in the periods 1 and 2 while she bears the cost of the
 needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 (in periods 1 and 2 respectively).
 The intertemporal substitution implies that she may save for growth to
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of consuming all her income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}=\nu_{t}+\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 she can spend all her income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1},i_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}$
\end_inset

 (respectively) or save some of it towards 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If we observe the states of the wealth - 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0},A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

, consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\{c_{1},c_{2}\},$
\end_inset

 cost of necessities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2}\}$
\end_inset

, the rate of growth of money (interest rate) 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and an exogenous income process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

, then we can solve for the parameters that govern the utility function
 additive over time i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To motivate a more general dynamic optimisation approach, consider first
 what consumer's choices would be in a one-period consumption.
 Here, she could either spend all income 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{_{1}}=\nu_{1}+\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or keep the minimum consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=0,c_{1}=\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

) in the period and end up with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}>A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, then the first-order conditions would provide us the optimal condition
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Let this utility be 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*},A_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 To extend this to two periods with dynamic optimisation one can exploit
 the fact that a consumer independently optimising 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+u_{2}$
\end_inset

 would always obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 are unbounded functions 
\begin_inset Formula $max(u_{1}+u_{2})\le max(u_{1})+max(u_{2})=u_{1}^{*}+u_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is only a tool to formulate the dynamic optimisation approach - using which
 the expected value of utility is to be optimised over her life period in
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

-period model (
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 being the age of the consumer).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The changes in expected utility per period are what drive her behaviour
 at every period 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and her choice is set to vary according to her age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (assuming that all consumers have similar expectations for the trajectory
 of their needs).
 A steady state would thus be achieved with ages 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 .
 The conditions of stability of the steady state imply that while consumers
 maintain different 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

, they are a function of characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the notion that a consumer may change her behaviour away from the
 current plan in the future is fallacious since a consumer observed at different
 ages is equivalent to consumers of varied ages at any point in time (see
 Deaton's clarification of the so-called dynamic inconsistency problem
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DeatonUnderstandingConsumption"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 In other words, the behaviour of an older consumer is the same as the future
 behaviour of a younger consumer.
 So the optimal solution for the total sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{T-t}u_{i}$
\end_inset

 would apply both to the individuals of all ages as well as an individual
 observed over a number of years.

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 Indeed the more educated people or those in better occupations (or those
 with higher perceived class) might need less durable goods and less quality
 to indicate status.
 We therefore include 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (which is static for the consumer) as part of the consumer utility by letting
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the high upfront cost attached to owning long-term durable goods,
 there may be a certain levelling effect to the extent to which durable
 goods may be used to compensate for not having the most favourable 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 may dominate the choice for non-durable consumption.
 In other words, ownership of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is quite likely to be segregated amongst those with different 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 An influential or a high-status 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has two competing roles for the consumer utility - first, it allows the
 consumer to not require as many durable goods as those in a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Second, it requires the consumer to maintain a certain level that is required
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 she possesses.
 This interplay of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is allows us to model the role of peer effects - i.e.
 that claim that the consumers consider quality relative to her reference
 group rather than an absolute level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If peer effects were to be modeled explicitly, let's say through a distance
 from average 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 calculated over 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (or over an ordinal class
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ChaiKaus2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), then as long as the higher status rank (part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) are also wealthy, the consumer with a high status rank due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 would also need to keep up the quality consumption to her wealthier reference
 level.
 Therefore, those in the higher rank (e.g.
 higher status occupations etc.) would benefit both from being in a higher
 status group (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) and from the higher durable goods possession that entails being in the
 high status group (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

).
 To avoid double-counting for the effect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 has on the utility, we choose only the characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that form the reference group over which the distance from average consumption
 is considered relevant for peer effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some recent literature has found an ordinal treatment of status more suitable
 for modeling status-related consumption.
 We believe that the properties of the average over the particular personal
 characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 allows us to consider an ordinal treatment without losing the tractability
 of averages in estimation.
 If we are sure to consider only the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that can serve as a reference group for consumption, then the presence
 of peer effects only means that the consumer does not worry about having
 less 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 than the average of a community (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 ) which she does not consider herself a member of.
 Instead, the utility derived by being ahead of the local average (of quality
 or durable goods) i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is more significant to her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To consider what this simplification offers to the econometric methods to
 follow, consider a market of just quality (and no durable goods) as an
 illustration.
 Here, a model for utility through 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $S=a\nu+b\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu$
\end_inset

 which is similar to the Ireland's signaling model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - in the sense that the utility is a combination of private and public
 sub-utilities.
 The model for 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed as 
\begin_inset Formula $S=a\nu+b\int_{\rho}f_{\nu}d\nu$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above can be interpreted as how the total utility can be seen as a combination
 of the sub-utility from the distance in quality from the local average
 and that from the overall effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 This interpretation permits us to approximate the first term with a function
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and the second term with a function solely of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer thus maintains both a relative advantage and the collective
 absolute advantage from quality - without issues of double-accounting.
 The approach would not change if difference in durable goods were introduced
 in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that the measurement of distance from needs which
 we track with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is not a measure of peer effects in itself.
 The distance from needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in fact only encompasses the higher price of the items or their consumed
 quantity.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 reflects spatial variation in prices, the controls for spatial variation
 must be included in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

Ideally, we should use a measure of needs rather the cost of needs.
 We use 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 not only because it is observed directly (rather than the quantities which
 are not observed) but also because it encapsulates the regional variation
 in prices.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The last assumption rests upon the definition of long-term durable goods
 being intergenerational (and thus long-term enough for their utility to
 not change over time).
 The subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is used to signify that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 does not change with personal characteristics the way 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 does not change with age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 The utility that the consumer gets from from the same level of quality
 and long-term durable would - on the other hand - vary with both personal
 characteristics (reference group) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 Due to the very definition of needs, preference of the total cost of needs
 does not vary with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}\nu d\nu$

 it also encompasses the peer effects arising out of the reference group
 identity.

Cost of Needs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input for the cost of needs is the diary of food items and the recall
 diary for upto one year.
 The consumption of the items that are considered necessities is calculated
 for the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 The cost of needs thus calculated in this manner (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

) depend on the particular locality where the household is located.
 Given the categories of consumption in Tanzania i.e.
 food, household, energy and transport, we calculate the cost of basic needs
 as the cost of minimal requirements in every category.
 As an example, we use the commodity sub-groups of carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables in the food category.
 The cost of this minimal basket per head - which is composed of the recommended
 nutrient quantities - are then calculated in each region and district based
 on the prices of the items recorded in the survey (which records the prices
 at the district level as well).
 For most regions, as it turns out, this minimum-cost basket could be a
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas - as these are most often
 the cheapest items in their respective sub-group (
\begin_inset Formula ${carb,fact,protein,fruitsveg}$
\end_inset

).
 As one would expect, the cost of this basket thus calculated is much higher
 in the urban areas than in the rural areas (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BasketsRegions2010"

\end_inset

) .
 The cost thus calculated is multiplied with the (adjusted) number of members
 in the family to arrive at the food component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar treatment for energy category, we find that the minimum
 requirements would be met for consumers in Tanzania with kerosene - given
 its ubiquity and comparatively low price with respect to sparsely available
 electricity in the country.
 Here, a calorie quota for a the preparation of a typical meal and lighting
 is used - leading us to use the cost of a certain amount of kerosene (or
 a cheaper alternative) per household when available.
 The information on the energy source uses for lighting and cooking by the
 household is used from the household questionnaire.
 The recommended quantities of kerosene, charcoal or for lighting and cooking
 with various energy sources are then used to evaluate the total cost of
 the energy needs (see Lam et al

 and https://energypedia.info/ for data on typical energy usage in the developing

For consumption under the household category, we consider the expenditure
 on clothing and housing needs.
 The costs of clothing in the region for a particular year are included
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The running costs of the house - depending on whether it's owned or rented
 are included in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 When the house is rented, the running costs are simply the reported rent
 on the house whereas when the house is owned by the household, a 2.5% of
 the cost of the house is used (the maintenance rate is estimated based
 on the expenditure reported in the survey for the houses that report maintenanc
e on the owned house) .
 The matching of need with the level of durable goods owned is similar to
 how the energy costs are set up based on the type of durable good one possesses.

 Thus, a user of electricity does not have much signaling advantage when
 compared with a non-user of electricity.
 In terms of the model, the user of electricity may indicate a higher status
 to those who don't have access to electricity through the ownership of
 electrical items rather than the consumption (part of

Income Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the income process 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

, we use the reported income from primary occupations in the Tanzania LSMS
 data over the years 2010, 2012 and 2014.
 One limitation of the Tanzanian LSMS data is that it does not provide income
 data for every household head for which the consumption diary and durable
 goods are recorded.
 Another limitation of the data set is that a household that is visited
 in a particular year is less likely to be visited after more than 2 years.
 This means that while a significant number households would be common between
 2010 and 2012 as well as between 2012 and 2014, very few households that
 were visited in 2010 would be visited the third time in 2014 (in fact less
 than 100 household from the survey in 2010 seem to be visited in 2014 for
 income survey).
 Such a lack of a true panel data compels us to prepare a pseudo-panel for
 the calibration of the income process.
 The pseudo-panel we prepare is based on the similarity of the number of
 adults, the number of children, the year of birth of the adults, the occupation
 and education levels
\begin_inset Foot

A minor issue encountered while the preparation of the pseudo-panel related
 to the age of the household members was circumvented with an approximate
 matching of that year-of-birth values.
 The LSMS community survey appears to have recorded the year-of-birth values
 for individuals in years 2010 and 2012 but the age variable is recorded
 instead for the year 2014.
 Matching the year-of-birth values from 2012 with the YOB values inferred
 from the recorded age was made possible by allowing a tolerance for matching
 the YOB values for the preparation of the pseudo-panel.

 While the FE GLS estimator for the pseudo-panel passes the Hausmann tests,
 we favour the use of RE estimator since the of time-invariant cross-sectional

Durable goods 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly relevant data from the LSMS survey is that of the durable
 goods used by the household.
 The list of durable goods recorded in the survey includes everything from
 a mobile phone to land or houses (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the median costs of these durable goods).
 The details of records include the number of durable goods owned by the
 household, the reported cost at which the durable good was purchased and
 the price the household expects by selling the durable good in the market
 at the time of the survey.
 While these data fields are promising for the intertemporal setting we
 wish to make use of, some refinement of this data is necessary due to the
 measurement errors with the costs and the current price (the latter is
 referred to as marked-to-market average or mtm average in the current discussio
n).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue with the reported cost is typical of those based on a consumer
 recall.
 Recorded by the survey at two time-points spread across two years (let's
 call the time points 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

), these reported costs may change over a period of two years - i.e.
 the reported cost of the same durable good in 2012 (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) may be significantly different from the cost recorded in 2014 (
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 To some extent, the reported cost of the durable goods follows the mtm
 average which itself is less susceptible to the issue as it is not recalled
 from consumer's memory and reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable
 good over time instead.
 The mtm average of the durable goods (like the cost of the durable good)
 is a value averaged over the number of durable goods owned by consumer.
 Therefore, the cost incurred by the purchase of a new durable good - that
 we're interested in - is not directly observed in the mtm average and relies
 on the field indicating number of durable goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the value of new purchases relies on the number of durable goods observed
 in the survey, we detect an durable good purchase only when a difference
 in the number of durable goods over the successive years is observed.
 The difference between the mtm average is thus recorded as part of new
 durable goods only as long as we observe a difference in number of durable
 goods in the two-year period (i.e.
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

).
 The number of durable goods observed however is also subject to some measuremen
t error and requires some further refinements for us to calculate the total
 cost of durable goods.
 That said, since we are interested in the the new durable good purchases
 for our analysis, someone buying their first music player is unlikely to
 make counting errors than someone adding to their collection of music systems.
 We thus look for significant changes in durable goods numbers (e.g.
 if they change from 0 to 1 or substantially 3 to 5 or to 6,7...
 etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible issue with a calculation of durable good cost changes as outlined
 above is that the measurement error with the number of durable goods may
 get magnified for more expensive durable goods such as house.
 However, since we also observe whether the individual owns a house or not
 from the household questionnaire (which records the housing-status through
 a direct question), we confirm that this error is not significant after
 reconciling the calculated differences with the data from the household
 questionnaire.
 What this reconciliation does remind us however is that the durable goods
 recorded in the survey indicate whether the household uses (or has access
 to) the durable goods rather than what it owns
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A lot of households in rented or employer-provided houses report having
 a house.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since rental options - except for housing - are fairly limited in the developin
g economies, this does not pose a significant measurement error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final caveat for the data is the presence of split households.
 A significant portion of the households may split into two or more households.
 Considering a split household as the terminal state of a household, we
 don't consider the parent household while calculating durable good differences
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 if it has terminated in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, durable good net-differences are included only as long
 as the households have not split in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow t+1$
\end_inset

.
 As explained in the discussion of the model, we only wish to consider durable
 goods that can be potentially transferred over generations (it is easy
 to verify these when the households are split).
 In the Tanzanian LSMS data, we consider any durable good more expensive
 than bed as eligible to be transferred to the next generation.
 This can be verified with the data on split household.
 The durable goods in the survey that are not life-long durable goods e.g.
 mobile phones, dish-tv etc.
 are not considered in the net-durable good changes 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{\tau+1}=A_{\tau+1}-A_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Costofassets2014"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a median-cost order of the durable goods recorded in 2014).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For robustness tests to our conclusions, we attempt to both sharpen and
 smoothen the data on durable goods changes by considering purchases within
 coarser groups such as electronic items, furniture etc.
 and by turning off the effect of depreciation in the durable good difference
 calculation respectively.
 The first test to sharpen the data is with classification of new durable
 goods into coarser categories - which is useful in its own right in order
 to interpret the distribution of functional durable goods - since counting
 the instances of purchases of just any electronic item may make more sense
 than the purchase of individual items such as a music system or a CD player.
 The appeal of the grouping approach is also due the extreme differences
 in urban and rural markets in an economy like Tanzania.
 Grouping the durable goods into agricultural electronic, electric and livestock
 categories accentuates the minor additions to one's durable goods - by
 giving the cheaper durable goods purchased by the consumer the same treatment
 as the more expensive durable goods.
 The downside with such a grouping is of course this very collation of durable
 goods with vast differences in prices within a single group (cd-player
 and music system for example may have vast differences in prices but could
 be counted as a new electronic durable good purchased).
 As our primary intention has been to get the total durable goods costs
 we have refrained from using such grouping as a primary means of analyses.

\begin_layout Standard
The method to smoothen the data on the other hand has clear advantages.
 As we have noted earlier, in every two years of the survey, the mtm-average
 by the household is susceptible to both how the household interviewee may
 estimate the change in the market and whether the interviewee from the
 household in a particular year is different from the interviewee household
 member in another year.
 The durable goods data can thus be smoothened by separating the effect
 of these factors if we can consider only only one year's prices.
 To explain this with an example, consider an durable good 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 whose value is 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the reported average mtm of the durable good at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of durable goods the household possesses.
 To avoid the measurement error associated with the difference in the estimate
 from the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, we prefer to use the mtm-average estimate (price) at either from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the difference in cost of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 could be either be 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}\times(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}P_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t}P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 Choosing the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 however leads us to another issue due to the sparsity of data.
 As we rely on a district-level granularity of data, not only would we not
 have the price reported for an item not owned by the consumer in period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, there may not be enough purchases in the district for us to estimate the
 cost of the item that consumer in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t}$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One way to circumvent this is to classify all durable goods into cheap,
 middle-range and expensive categories based on cost quantiles in the period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and then determine the category of the durable good purchased in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 based on its price in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
 The price at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 would then by the price of matching category (expensive, middle-range or
 cheap) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Since, we may as well use the price at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, this indirect methods is rendered unnecessary.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As we're interested in the price for the new purchases (i.e.
 cases such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t+1}>0$
\end_inset

), the prices at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset

) do not suffer with this issue.
 The expenditure on new durable goods calculated is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{a,t+1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Delta n_{a,t+1}=P_{a,t+1}(n_{a,t+1}-n_{a,t})$

 error in the estimate provided by the household member interviewee.

\end_inset

 (the c.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical life-cycle consumption patterns can be confirmed with the significan
ce of age-related coefficients.
 More particularly, the quality (excess) consumption seems to decline with
 age while durable good purchases do not seem to be influenced by age as
 much.
 Apart from the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and needs, the disposable income (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

) also depends on the durable goods someone owns through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which includes durable good-bearing costs).
 Thus a weak significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 simultaneously with a strong significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 implies a stronger effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 that have much influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (durable goods such as land that do not require a high maintenance cost
 proportional to their cost are purchased less often than those that have
 higher bearing costs).
 Further, the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 is negative while it is positive for quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that higher disposable income (lower needs or higher income)
 is more often associated with higher quality (excess) and less durable
 good purchases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of durable goods 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is statistically weak, but the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is quite significant.
 More durable goods purchases are made by those who are already rich in
 relative terms, the new durable goods purchased are mostly those that are
 associated with high running costs.
 While the distribution of wealth - reflected in the ownership of expensive
 durable goods such as a house or land - do determine which consumers purchase
 new durable goods, the significance of disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=i-\Psi$
\end_inset

 (shown as lt1 in the table) - which we estimate using occupation, education
 and needs over the years 2012 and 2014 - and its negative coefficient for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 indicates that the new durable goods are purchased by those with high 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 (which is inclusive of durable goods bearing costs) and/or the new durable
 good purchases are by those who have relatively less incomes (
\begin_inset Formula $i_{t}$
\end_inset

 estimated through better occupation and education).
 This trend seems to reverse for the measure of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the ownership of durable good such as land and housing, disposable
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the sort of wealth that lends to more social mobility.
 The educated and the highly-paid may pass on their skills and social networks
 to the progeny, but the transfer of such soft-durable goods to the next
 generation is more dissipative than the monetary wealth.
 Such soft-assets might not result in the ownership of more expensive durable
 goods (such as housing or land) but these do require consumption on education
 and social functions anyways.
 The durable good purchases may suggest the limits of the durable goods
 purchases.
 This is made clearer with the significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 for expenditure on quality(
\shape italic
excess
\shape default
) consumption indicates.
 Those with less durable goods but with better income do seem to spend more
 on quality (including education).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences in urban and rural lifestyles also play a role in the difference
 in durable good purchases as well as quality.
 This is in particular due to the the availability of electricity being
 limited to urban areas in Tanzania.
 The durable goods that are not as expensive as land or housing are more
 likely to be available in the urban settings.
 In terms of the model, what such a difference in the consumer baskets implies
 is that while the educated and highly-paid face higher prices for durable
 good purchases in the urban areas - they are less likely to raise prices
 in the items they depend on the the rural areas for and more likely to
 deviate from their basic needs with their local (urban) requirements.
 This would raise the prices of the industrial goods in the urban areas
 - thus separating the consumption habits of those in the urban areas from
 those who don't have avenues for expenditure on industrial goods (electricity
 etc.) in the rural areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a need to exercise caution in the interpretation of the tobit /
 OLS results using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 which - in econometric terms - is treated as a proxy for prices, regional
 variations, age and the effects of wealth.
 To allow our conclusions to be more robust, it may be worthwhile to to
 decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 into more control variables - possibly by reformulating the model in the
 Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nut1regression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dAt_regression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 to employ a quantile regression based on age, income, durable good costs
 - while still maintaining the key purpose of the model which is to separate
 means of income from wealth in an analysis of the intertemporal substitution
 between durable good purchases and quality (excess) under a life-cycle
 setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of our analysis has been to look beyond the models for visible
 consumption.
 At a fundamental level, we believe the status consumption is motivated
 by the perceived risk in one's stability of wealth.
 Therefore, consumers' participation in status consumption should be seen
 as a specific instance of the the participants exhibiting a risk-seeking
 behaviour (i.e.
 a disproportionate expenditure) towards goods and services that may lead
 to a large payoff (immense success) with a small probability (through joining
 golf clubs, engaging in social events - status competitions with a small
 upfront cost).
 This may serve as a refinement to the conventional assumptions of a balance
 between the urban and rural prices in the models that explore rural migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While visible items do capture such risk-seeking behaviours in the developed
 economies very well, the difference in wealth and the segregation of quality
 of life in the developing countries are both direct and dominant (as they
 may be in segregated societies in the developed economies).
 Without a
\bar under
 
\bar default
consideration of how the durable goods are distributed in the economy and
 are subject to change, one must be circumspect about the presence of status
 consumption in the developing countries.
 When the majority of households have very little disposable income and
 basic durable goods possessions, the visible consumption need not be limited
 to the conventionally visible items e.g.
 clothing or jewelry alone.
 In the particular case of Tanzanian LSMS data, for example, we would see
 that most houses report having metallic sheet roofs or a bamboo or thatch
 roofs.
 In the backdrop of low durable goods ownership in an underdeveloped economy,
 a cement roof is likely to be more visible for signaling than would be
 the expenditure on clothing .
 The expenditure on carpets-rugs would similarly seem to be a case of visible
 consumption - but its usage is more likely to be driven by asymmetries
 of the distribution of industrial goods and of home ownership rather than
 visibility needs of the consumers.
 The consideration of conventional visible goods e.g.
 clothing, shoes may not be sufficient to give us an idea of how status
 may be signalled in the economy .
 While we see no reason to believe that there should be no status consumption
 in the rural environment, we do feel the need to expand the set of items
 that are considered visible - since a minor association with an urban setting
 or access to any industrial good would also be visible enough to the consumers
 in their respective reference groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed this is not to say that the consumption on items that are categorically
 visible does not tell us much about the demand in the developing countries.
 In the context of Tanzania, expenditure on bride-price is a clear case
 for visible consumption - and is worth exploring in its own right - but
 if one were to develop a theory of status consumption instead of revisiting
 visible consumption in varied cultural contexts in this manner, the considerati
ons of social mobility, wealth and durable goods ownership seem an obvious
 first step.
 Indeed in the particular case of marriages too, we would only improve our
 understanding of the bride price if we realise that marriages are both
 an indication of one's social status as well as a potential for advancement
 in social ranking - forces that are at play in durable goods purchases
 more generally in much the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the literature on rural and urban differences in the developing
 world should be extended to include status consumption on grounds of generality.
 The context of status consumption varies significantly across economies
 and one often needs to make adjustments for the particular social conditions
 to draw conclusions on visible consumption.
 Using an intertemporal behavioural model to explain consumption may help
 us in standardising the markets for status in disparate economies and help
 us observe the extent to which the consumers engage in status consumption
 across the various states of economies.
