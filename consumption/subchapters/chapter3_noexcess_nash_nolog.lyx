Compared to Oxoby, 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 has a direct role and is based on subjective lack of knowledge of the world.
 It is only through competitions that consumer form their identity and would
 make fairly random decisions before.
 Therefore they would put 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 thinking they have a fair chance of being a winner.
 That the long-term equilibrium does not allow that does not matter - since
 the consumers think it does not affect them.
 Unlike in Oxoby, a poor decision affects them monetarily if they make a
 bad decision (what does their fixed-horizon equilibrium imply) and they
 don't really get any non-monetary utility.
 Like Cole-Maliath - they get only monetary benefit.
 Status is implied only through the assets somebody acquires - a view that
 is fundamentally dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $W,L$
\end_inset

 (see Kornienko).
 The idea that consumers compensate for not having status is strictly represente
d as risk-taking consumers compensate by taking unlikely risks.
 The consumer gets utility from her own relative wealth as well.
 The band-membership represents the non-transactional advantages of consumers
 - that do affect the consumer's wealth - albeit indirectly.
 The poor want to associated with the rich by status consumption because
 it provides a certain promise of gaining non-transactionally.
 The rich want not to be associated with the poor because they fear that
 they may be disadvantaged.
 Our model is different from Cole Maliath in two fundamental ways - first
 we consider the long-term implications of the equilibrium - second we utility
 association with asset-accumulation.
 Income distributions matter in Cole-Maliath (and Korenienko).
 We look at huge significant differences in income distribution caused by
 regional or social barriers.
 We believe that this cannot be understood without a probability formulation
 - because utility from matching does involve consideration of probability.
 Desire for status is about aligning oneself with this probability - while
 simultanesouly choosing higher assets.
 We also allow - with a simpler formulation - for societies to differ in
 the degrees of their rat races.
 The raison d'etre of disposable income bands are the really long-term effects
 which consumers accept but have no control over (non-transactional aspects)[als
o see Krupka-Weber].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared to Kornienko, we do visit the long-term questions (see paper).
 We do not assume that the quality is distributed with a known distribution
 - but use the conditions of long-term stability of the tournament to to
 obtain some properties of the tournament.
 We look at long-term conditions but only to motivate that long-term conditions
 are not possible and that short-term equilibria do not need to satisfy
 the long-term requirements of stability.
 The relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, assets and income bands are thus assumed exogenous.
 A certain 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 need not imply long-term stability.
 Winners in the tournament get monetary benefit - which determine status.
 We expose the consumer not taking part in the competition to a risk of
 being thrown into a lower band - this is key to adjusting to bring L+W=1.
 We use the utility under risk to understand - by explicit representation
 of the returns from competitions (which could be depend on the specific
 tournament - different competitions would have different probabilities).
 The incentive effect is modelled by the authors using the dispersion order.

\begin_layout Standard
Many equilibria are possible the separating equilibria could be dependent
 on the degrees of risk-aversion.
 We use an alternative formulation of rank-preserving changes.

\begin_layout Standard
We look at the specific problem of too long-term inequalities.
 Although the distribution of rewards is considered by kornienko, we do
 not use their model because ...
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On one hand, status goods are those that indicate consumer's exclusivity
 but on the other, they are goods that create bandwagon effects for those
 who don't have much status.
 For both the modeler and the empirical analyst, the issue that status goods
 imply higher status both for those who already have higher status and those
 who don't is addressed with its association with a reference group .
 The consumers often do not know the reason to purchase status items as
 they would for purchasing food or clothing items.
 The association with a reference group also addresses the descriptive significa
nce of the conscpiuous consumption - argument without which the mechanisms
 of individious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation (PE) identified
 by Veblen would remain normative concerns.
 The uncertainty towards each other's status - i.e.
 the lack of a clear reason for purchasing status item - could in fact be
 said to drive conspicuous consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the view articulated by Cole-Maliath as non-transactional choices
 excercised by the consumer.
 We buld upon the framework where consumer participate in competitions with
 status items (see Frank) in an environment of income and wealth differences.
 The specific goal of in the proposed chapter is to explain how income differenc
es could influence status consumption choices for the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an approach similar to Cole and Maliath, we argue that the consumer does
 not get utility from the references and allow the uncertainty arising out
 of non-transactional choices to contribute to the consumer's future expectation
s for status competitions.
 The core of the argument that is that if status goods - such as jewelry
 or club membership - offered returns contributing to status that are in
 no way more uncertain than the purchase of expensive long-term assets such
 as a house, the representative consumer would know of the futility of status
 consumption relative to saving towards higher wealth.
 Status consumption thus cannot be understood in the intertemporal framework
 without arguing that visible or conspicuous good offer a utility different
 from the one that is derived from regular goods.
 While the split of utility into visible and non-visible terms allows us
 to understand status consumption in a setting where signaling goods are
 accessible to everyone, the empirical distinctions between regular and
 visible items could be more difficult in environments of extreme income
 and wealth differences (e.g.
 in developing economies where relative wealth would be more easily visible).
 This motivates the proposed approach to viewing status consumption as a
 risky position in an intertemporal framework.
 INCOME IS NOT NECESSARILY PRIVATE IN THIS MODEL (hopkins korenienko assume
 continuum of rewards as well - see Which inequality).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows from view of status as wealth under uncertainty that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

having status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cannot be a prerequisite for participating in status competitions.
 If only those with status needed to spend on status goods, we would see
 no status consumption in societies as they moved towards equality.
 Instead, as the empirical literature from Hirsch, Galbraith notes, the
 improvement in median incomes seems to have increased the focus on status
 items in the developed world.
 The rise in status consumption with falling inequality in the economy is
 in agreement with the view of status under uncertainty since with less
 income differences in an economy, status goods are all what consumers can
 use to participate in competitions for status.
 In other words, when basic amenities are guaranteed (i.e.
 certain) for everyone and wealth differences are lower, the avenues for
 demonstrating status are limited to conspicuous items.

THEORY 
\series default
PT motivated view] Seeking a descriptive theory for consumer decision under
 risk, the literature in behaviour economics often decomposes consumer utility
 into value (with respect to a reference) and a probability of gain in value.
 This approach, particularly the modern prospect theory, has reported a
 remarkable explanatory power in both experimental and real-world settings.
 But since the probabilities in a behavioural experiment are represented
 in a simulated game where consumers beliefs motivate a certain position
 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lottery
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 offered to them ,the empirical analysis of consumer choice using the behavioura
l framework has been limited due to the challenges in instrumenting probabilitie
s with the macro-economic uncertainties e.g.
 that expressed by the volatility of past interest rates or price indices.
 Focusing on the particular context of consumer choice in an environment
 of extreme wealth and income differences, the proposed chapter provides
 a framework that may use the insights from behavioural issue by considering
 a finite set of income bands and the transition probabilities among them.
 More specifically, if the reference group relevant for status consumption
 are implied by long-term characteristics (such as wealth, income-level,
 region or social identity), a certain transition probability between income-ban
ds can be used to understand the consumer response to risk implied by the
 transition probabilities prospects for future
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An empirical analyses using this simplified view may however require specific
 surveys tailored to the model.
 Both the data on cross-generational mobility and the material promise of
 the assumed status goods are needed for us to consider the how the consumers
 may evaluate any future promise from consumption.
 As such the measurement of intergenerational mobility in empirical economics
 varies significantly across economies.
 Alesina et al for example use data on education for mobility - given the
 poor availability of income data in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The promise from status goods has been addressed through direct surveys
 e.g.
 by Heffetz and Khamis et al who have attempted to focus on identifying
 status goods by asking the consumer to sort the items based on their associatio
n with high status.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast with the conventional intertemporal approach where a substitution
 between consuming now vs gaining interest through assets is considered,
 the imprecise value towards status allows us to talk about the evaluation
 of future risk through status consumption.
 The underlying assumption is that the transition probability changes with
 status consumption and encompasses all possible paths in which a consumer
 could to rise in the hierarchy of income or and wealth.
 With that view of the transition probability, we consider a utility derived
 through absolute value of assets as well as the non-transactional state
 of being a particular income-band.
 This is similar to the Cole-Maliath approach where consumers would care
 about status because in equilibrium it affects variables that enter the
 utility function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[ABA assumption] There are two key assumptions that characterise this model.
 The first assumption is that transition probability faced by all consumers
 within the reference are the same.
 The differentiation in income-bands represents the environment of income
 and asset differences that influence varied status goals.
 [ bags, private jets, food all represent different clases ] We view such
 income bands as clusters of incomes and assets with limited mobility -
 so that the relative position of income-bands is stays the same - thus
 ruling out a significant redistribution of asset values (e.g.
 with enormous taxation).
 On one hand, the processes of accumulation and inheritance are assumed
 to ensure that the wealth acquired within such bands is stable over time,
 but a certain mobility for all participans in the economy is allowed to
 assist inclusion, fairness and stability across the bands.
 In other words, every one in a higher income-band having higher income
 would maintain a certain competition to admit those below the respective
 band to become a member.
 
\bar under
This transition probability is a stable distribution function 
\bar default
that is the same for all income-bands except 
\bar under
for the reference levels imposed by every income-band
\bar default
 (NOT CLEAR).
 All disposable income in excess of a reference level associated with the
 income-band is meant to increase the consumer's chances in being promoted
 to the next income-band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[INTERCHANGEABILITY Reference] The second assumption is that comparisons
 of status involve status consumption only within a particular income-band.
 In other words, the income-band identities dominate status comparisons
 across different income-bands so that no two consumers in the two different
 income-bands are in same status competition.
 This makes empirical sense for two reasons - first the status comparisons
 require a certain notion of interchangeability
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is also implicit in the status inference approaches - which assume
 that all consumers have the same inference function.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Second, while status goals could offer some utility in lieu of higher assets
 - they are not more important in the long term than extreme differences
 in wealth.
 Consider for example, a classical musician who considers herself of higher
 status than the country musician even though she has a lower accumulated
 wealth than the country musician.
 There are two possibilities when this might happen in the model.
 First is when the two musicians belong to the same income-band and the
 second when they don't.
 When the classical musician considers herself in the same reference group
 as that of the country musician, her private held belief of a higher status
 relies on certain qualities of classical music that carry more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

value
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (at least privately) than the crowds that country music can draw.
 This private view is however unknown to consumers both in other income
 bands and within her own.
 There is no reason to think that consumers having a higher preference for
 classical musicians would result in a better income for country musicians.
 Any non-private notion of status in other words must be reflected in wealth
 differences among the musicians.
  The country musicians having higher wealth would have higher status in
 the band - except for the qualities of sublimity (and a history of elite
 patronage) that might enable an immense future material growth (however
 unlikely) for the classical musician.
 Thus if both classical and country musicians are in the same income-band,
 they compare themselves both on the net worth they achieve through labour
 and how prepared they are to be in the next/higher income-band e.g.
 with the proper education (theoretical foundations) or the sophistication
 to build future social networks.
 The two types of musicians being in the same income-band exposes their
 decision-making to same uncertainty and probability of future success as
 they rank themselves in status.
 Whether they are in the same income-band or not in the model depends on
 the whether most classical musicians and most country musicians make comparable
 income or not.
 When the classical musician and the country musician do not consider themselves
 in the same reference group, they must carry different asset-values (overall)
 and face different probability of future asset growths.
 This is likely when the payoffs from classical music and country music
 gigs are so different that the classical musicians and country musicians
 can never be in the same income-band.
 The assumption that income-bands dominate status comparison only asserts
 that status comparisons require a notion of interchangeability that does
 not overcome extreme wealth differences.

For the promotion of a consumer to the next income band in a society with

\begin_inset Formula $J(\nu)$
\end_inset

 that rewards status consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 by a consumer with a promotion to the next band higher or a demotion to
 lower band (if either exist).
 The consumer would choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected future asset value and the income band she may
 be in the future.
 These band are determined by the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y$

 be the same for all consumers in a particular asset-band.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[SC as a basic mechanism] The final goal of every consumer in the model
 is to have the highest assets in the economy so that the disposable income
 in every asset band can be used to accumulate towards assets or participate
 in tournaments of unobserved ability (e.g.
 those for musicians).
 As discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the social institutions provide structural status competitions that provide
 mobility while stratification would prevent more participation.
 The success in status competitions serves both as an evidence of ability
 and as a barrier to entry for those with less proven abilities.
 In other words, the success in status competitions carries both status
 and expected wealth in this economy (see the Status is wealth equilibria
 in Cole-Maliath).
 The ability pertinent to one's status may be innate, unobserved and responsible
 for success in the status competitions, but it is relevant only through
 probabilistic monetary success in the long-term.

 In other words, the distribution of outlier performers in every band is
 assumed to follow the same structure - only that the consumers must maintain
 a certain level of status consumption in every band to have a chance to
 be promoted to the higher band.
 A lower band (or a poor economy) may thus have a lower base-level consumption
 on status goods (or cheaper status goods) but the outperformers in a poor
 environment are expected to improve their fortunes through the same mechanism
 that a consumer in a higher-income band (or in a richer country) would.

 This no different from the assumption of stable growth of assets in the
 intertemporal substitution problem where too different starting asset wealth
 across imply disparate interest-incomes.
 While stable equilibrium is possible in the intertemporal model framework
 with a diminishing marginal utility for consumption and heterogeneity in
 prices, we seek a model for returns for varied risk from consumption more

The alternative to the stochastic utility view of status consumption is
 the optimisation of a utility comprising of both wealth and status components.
 It is possible to view the stochastic utility approach as a way of combining
 wealth and status utilities where a higher probability of wealth stability
 attached with a higher status.

 Notice that while we focus on differences in disposable incomes, the consumer
 needs are implicitly the same (fundamentally) across all the income bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[SC - random] Assuming the same preferences for all consumers, an equilibrium
 is implied in an economy with different bands of disposable incomes if
 we assume that the consumer can move across bands through a mechanism of
 exchange at a certain cost.
 The preferences being the same implies that if consumers were to be swapped
 with each other over time without having incurred any costs for the exchange,
 their final state wouldn't be any difference from if they weren't swapped.
 If we however, a swap of consumers from two successive bands was at a cost
 and fair (so that all consumers eventually get a fair chance to participate
 in the exchange), a stable equilibrium would follow.
 A simple scheme for such an exchange is by randomly selecting winners and
 losers in every band and swapping them while resetting their accumulated
 wealth.
 One could also attach a more general participation cost status competition
 that does not reset one's accumulation in exchange of a promotion.
 As long as this costs vary across asset bands, it follows hat the more
 consumers accumulate, the higher they must give up by losing their current
 band.
 On the other hand, less accumulation does not necessarily shun the consumer
 to the lowest bands due the possibility of being randomly selected for
 being promoted to a higher band as a winner.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[With SC] To the consumer who faces the choice to accumulate in her own
 band or with higher income in the next band, we prefer a mechanism for
 an exchange where a consumer either lose or gain in the her band status
 rather than one where she only gains or retains status.
 Such an exchange mechanism would be ensure in the stable populations of
 bands in the equilibrium.
 A more general formulation of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $J(\nu)$
\end_inset

 would also need to ensure that the entry and exit of consumers in each
 band maintain a stable population.
 The selecting the best and the worst candidates in every asset-band is
 a discrete event that happens with a probability modifiable with status
 consumption

 If we don't care about asset-boundaries we don't need to worry about asset-main

 If swap was only of places not of assets, then nothing would change since
 all preference are the same.
 However, if assets are also carried over after swap, then the random selection

 The bias through  status consumption comes through differential costs in
 mobility.
 The poor may face uphill costs for mobility whereas the middle classes
 less so (relative to their disposable incomes).
 This should also be evident from the model.
 That uniform selection is not the magic solution for fairness in - particularly
 if credit and high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is presented - which would allow consumer to take bet on the uniform likelihood
 - since the lowest band consumers would continue to avail the uniform selection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[The subjective basis of probability] One of our constraints it that only
 one loser and one winner is selected in every draw.
 Imagine a real scenario where a college or dating website was matching
 winners and losers.
 The matchmakers in the two successive asset bands do not care what the
 consumers being exchanged have accumulated.
 Therefore the consumer don't know either.
 However, we do need to know how this probability would give utility to
 the consumer (who could be risk-neutral or not).
 What the consumer would know is that having low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 would reset her 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 when she loses.
 This is hardly atrocious.
 However, we do not assume that risk-aversions vary and therefore consumers
 are all assumed to have same preferences.
 The consumers therefore get swapped without carrying over their preferences.
 There is no coordination assumed matchmakers or the two bands.
 One example from the real-world is how students pay the fees without knowing
 that we are good at math or English - if we don't do that we lose out since
 we are in a different league - being a loser in the school could be worse
 than being home-schooled.
 Without knowing what one is made of this is a chance that parents would
 take.
 Still in the average we know that high-spenders would get their way more
 easily - regardless of the idiosyncratic factors for individual success.
 Subjective probability provides the basis for status competitions.
 We look at implications.

No long-term horizon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[LT Equlibrium] For long-term equilibrium concern, we ask ourselves are
 populations more stable than assets - or do they counter each other.
 Is it more often that composition of bands change e.g.
 by giving income to more people or less people resulting in more people
 getting poorer or more of them getting richer - while their assets don't
 grow as much.
 Is it instead that the band compositions remain stable while assets grow
 for all.
 We have seen what happens in the latter with status competitions.
 Class boundaries are more long-term and defined more arbitrarily than assets
 owned by the consumers.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 bands collapse and expand randomly, then we would not have a notion of
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 classes.
 We might not consider the infinite horizon because there might not be an
 infinite equilibrium.
 The stable equilibrium of assets and bands - where assets grow steadily
 and bands stay well-defined is as unlikely to stable as is the inequality.
 The even more fundamental question is whether stable disposable income
 differences themselves are a consequence of huge-asset differences - because
 they can't provide an equilibrium except through probability.
 Another way the equilibrium may exist if consumer choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 based on their projections that make view a false future equilibrium.
 This false equlibrium however cannot be an observed real-world equilibrium.We
 are looking for a stationarity when income differences, asset differences
 exist and some sort of status-competition as well.
 It is fair to assume that disposable income differences themselves do not
 imply a long-term equilibrium since the only sustainable solution for SC
 is when a low winning probability is compensated with a high losing probability
 (or vice versa) to provide no net benefit to the consumer - thus stabilising
 their assets.
 This latter option provides a better end of the world scenario if the infinite
 horizon was to be considered.

 Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How would dispersion in assets include consumer behavour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[LT Equilibrium] So the end of the world scenario we're after is not one
 where consumers stabilise net further income but one where participation
 no longer matters.
 Differences in disposable income don't matter - because there is sufficient
 mobility.
 Existing class differences exist but they are fine due to existing - that's
 the other type of equilibrium that is possible.The usual recurrent states
 don't take us very far from the unsustainable state of differences in disposabl
e income causing extreme asset differences.
 The necessary assumption in this second type of equilibrium is that the
 
\begin_inset Formula $W,L$
\end_inset

 can evolve over time to keep or around 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 to impose a certain eqiulibrium - i.e.
 in a certain range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 allow no further net addition of assets.
 This equilibrium is necessary if the income bands survive because at some
 point - moving to different places should allow you to not move much anywhere.
 The martingale condition gives the more natural long-term equilibrium that
 the status competitions can provide - if there has to be any equilibrium
 at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Infinite or not] We assume that such a trivial equilibrium is possible
 at infinity only if we can argue that in the long-term, the consumers beahviour
 would satisfy the martingale condition.
 The martingale condition be arrived at any time - it's almost like a stopping
 time.
 Since the consumers enter stability anytime.
 Further, the exit condition (martingale) is through the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $L,W$
\end_inset

 as well as the certain value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 There is really noting to maximise in the long-term equilbirium - which
 would see the stable asset differences.
 The consumers can't optimise long-term equilibrium but only a certain time
 until which the martingale condition is not achieved.
 If indeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}+W_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 is not possible for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, then the long-term equilibrium would not exist.
 Short-term equilibria are only when the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}+W_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 has not been met - after it, the consumer would need to deviate again.
 Recall that Nash equilibiria assumes that 
\begin_inset Formula $L,W$
\end_inset

 encompass the behaviour of other consumers.
 Nash equilibria may drive the consumer to long-term equilibrium but that
 needs to be verified (also see Kornienko).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Risk-Neutral] The consumer could plainly maximise sume of time-discounted
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 over time or having risk-aversion-based utility.
 Either way, she would choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 at every 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to maximise next period.
 This would give us her strategy of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 over time - probabily average over the band she can be in 
\begin_inset Formula $T-1$
\end_inset

.
 The first-order conditions in every period would give us a solution.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
[Not infinite] If we're interested only in shor-term equilibria - then we
 don't need to worry about the sustainability.
 Nash equilibria can be sought by assuming that other consumer have a certain

\end_inset

 strategy i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{i}$
\end_inset

 for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $W,L$

 That the choices of other consumers satisfy the long-term conditions is
 not ruled out by this.
 In fact it should be shown what Nash equilibria would result in the long-term.

\begin_layout Standard
Before we get into Pareto and Nash equilibria, the next question is the
 kind of stability we are after.
 The stationarity condition is fairly limited - which would require a stable
 growth in differences.
 A constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 that would allow expected assets to stabilise would be one that increases
 the difference indefinitely.
 The other option is that of an alternating equilibrium where the assets
 are reset every time there is a major disparity.
 The important result is that a matching scheme that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{t}$
\end_inset

 stabilises only through the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 - but not through
\begin_inset Formula $W,L$
\end_inset

.
 If we're not looking at the stability of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{t}$
\end_inset

, then we need to be clear - whose stability are we looking for.
 If consumers were maximising or stabilising a certain function 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{T\rightarrow\infty}f(A_{T})$
\end_inset

, that would require them to stabilise 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{T}$
\end_inset

 does not stabilise, then the only possible option is a regime switch where
 consumers take turns beyond a certain threshold.
 This needs to be proven.
 What we can live with therefore is that consumers don't have a fixed set
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 but choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 as a function 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y-f(A)$
\end_inset

 roughly stays the same.
 When staying in 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 for a long time, the consumers keeping suffer with low 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 - the differences increase and the consumers keep shuffling between the
 bands.
 The other option is that there is a process that forces a reset - once
 the economies diverge.
 Regardless, we seem to have a proof for against a stable equilibrium -
 so what does finite-horizon equilibrium mean?

The stationary condition is achieved only if
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}-\nu_{1}^{*}=y_{2}-\nu_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the consumers choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 so that their income excluding the status consumption is the same.
 This implies that the higher income band must maintain a high status consumptio
n and thus higher risk for there to be a stable equilibrium (which is true
 regardless of any exchange scheme implied by 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

).
 However, this also means that the differences in assets continue to grow
 indefinitely.
 If income bands are as stable as the status competitions that support them,
 this is not the equilibrium that can accompany the status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\tau}=0$
\end_inset

 in the long-run implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{1}^{*})=1-L_{2}(\nu_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

 in the long-run.
 A a low winning probability in the long-run must be compensated by high
 losing probability to provide no average net benefit to the consumer in
 the long-run.
 This is the only way that differences in disposable income across bands
 may be sustained in the long-run.
 If the LTE is so that consumer stay where they are i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}+L_{2}=1$
\end_inset

 in the long-term then at in the short-term equilbria either 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}>L_{2}-1$
\end_inset

 (when consumer in the band 1 gain more often than consumers in band 2 lose)
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}<L_{2}-1$
\end_inset

 when consumers in the band 2 lose more often than consumers in band 1 gain.
 Either of these would transfer the wealth in the other direction but a
 long-term equilibrium would need to have neutral transition for stability
 to arrive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Short-term horizon] What this means that a consumer looking to maximise
 income would only do so over a short-term horizon - since the infinite
 horizon leads to net income from the status consumption.
 Assuming that the consumer optimise total assets accumulated subject to
 her band-reference, we consider a plan of status consumption over the horizon
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 periods which the assets are accumulated over.
 Since the utilty for asset depends on the band-reference, a consumer would
 received a higher utility from the same value of assets if she is an poorer
 band.
 The band-specific utility for the consumer thus views total assets acquired
 by the consumer rather than the new income received in successive period.
 We assume that consumer save everything up towards accumulation in the
 last period and therefore the consumption in the last period is always
 zero for all the consumers regardless of how much wealth they have amassed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

[non-EUT consumer] The risk-aversion differences in the setup implied by

 We can view the utility a simple

\begin_inset Formula $p$

 The logistic function 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{e^{-(\nu-\mu)/s}}{s(1+e^{-(\nu-\mu)/s})^{2}}$
\end_inset

 describes the pdf.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for a very high value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 So 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$

 cannot be a pdf.
 For high
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$

 Only those with very high

 The consumers can be risk-averse or risk-seeking.

 This is because

 This is where budget might come in handy - if the consumer simply want
 to maximise probability then she would always take the maximum.
 In this scheme, the consumer takes

[Finite Horizon] The most important question for the finite horizon model
 is what the consumer does with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=T$
\end_inset

.
 Does she avail the final income and pass it on to the progeny (who would
 make her own decisions anyways) - or instead sees no point in accumulating
 and wants to bet it all on mobility.
 The latter would require she has more hope in stability of bands than assets.
 But we believe otherwise.
 Income and status competitions are less stable.
 Since we have the idea of the LTE and STE now, we acknowledge the short-termism
 by choosing an STE and thus it makes more sense to save at the end.
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 emulates the life-time or the time-horizon of the consumer - the imagined
 end of the world where LTE would start is where SC won't matter at all.
 If indeed income bands and status competitions were naturally observed
 phenomenon, we would have the equilbrium where differences 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{t}$
\end_inset

 stabilises, but both status competitions and income bands are man-made
 that are less stable than the long-term assets that consumers accumulate
 (through technological advancement or qualities in the market that would
 sustain status competitions)( see Kornienko).

 is like making the choice of a winner random.
 This selection implies a filtering based 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 as follows.
 Here, the consumers gain with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 only if there are are few consumers having 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}$

.
 Too many consumers being higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

 would mean that the returns from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 are not high.
 So there is an incentive of not going beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 The consumer gets the highest probability when she is the only one above
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Otherwise she might want to take the risk of being in the lower band.
 Notice that she does not know the 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in the other band.
 Out of the two general properties of the probability, the threshold mechanism
 does not guarantee higher utility for a consumer having a higher

[SWAP PROBABILITY] We have assumed that the winner gets to trade places

 a unison of some sort).
 When the consumer does not know the

\end_inset

 she opens herself to be randomly swapped with somebody else.
 We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

 are fixed for all asset-bands in the equilibrium.
 Let's consider the loser in the next band who has decided on being a loser
 because she is not as worried about being a loser.
 In other words, by choosing a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, she is ready to be swapping places with somebody in the lower band and
 reset her wealth.
 She gives up her accumulations - which won't get her to the next band anyways
 - and accepts receiving a much lower income.
 In the threshold scheme, the option for a consumer who wants to stay in
 the same band is to keep the probability of swap low by not becoming the
 poorest in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

Contrast with the conventional Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the conventional approach of the intertemporal substitution, we would
 argue that there is an observed rate of growth of assets which the consumer
 - but this interest rate is a huge assumption it works only because we
 want to observe consumption against long-term economic growth.
 That consumers differentiate between items for status also because their
 is a need associated with reference is discarded by the blanket assumption
 that all assets must grow and thus all consumption gives a felicity.
 All non-assets need not be consumed but invested in different streams -
 education is a different consumption from jewelry and so on.
 We therefore consider reference to be of key importance.
 That consumers must optimise value with respect to reference provides a
 better view of status consumption and does not require status consumption
 to be futile.
 Only fixing a function 
\begin_inset Formula $J(nu)$
\end_inset

 would tell us how soon the game would end etc..
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[COMPARISON with intertemporal model does not arise in two-period models]
 At this point it is worth contrasting this approach with the typical intertempo
ral substitution approach where all assets must be consumed at the point.
 Our approach is similar except that it refines the utility from the final
 consumption as a bet towards the final asset-band.
 So we have assumed a risk-neutral consumer who only ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical intertemporal substitution model also assumes the opposite of
 what have by using the assumption that nothing survives of the assets except
 for the consumption.
 What we're saying is that only that all consumption and accumulation must
 go to asset-band identity.
 That is like saying that effective wealth is zero at the end and the assets
 grow at a certain rate.
