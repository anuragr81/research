Compared to Oxoby, 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 has a direct role and is based on subjective lack of knowledge of the world.
 It is only through competitions that consumer form their identity and would
 make fairly random decisions before.
 Therefore they would put 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 thinking they have a fair chance of being a winner.
 That the long-term equilibrium does not allow that does not matter - since
 the consumers think it does not affect them.
 Unlike in Oxoby, a poor decision affects them monetarily if they make a
 bad decision (what does their fixed-horizon equilibrium imply) and they
 don't really get any non-monetary utility.
 Like Cole-Maliath - they get only monetary benefit.
 Status is implied only through the assets somebody acquires - a view that
 is fundamentally dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $W,L$
\end_inset

 (see Kornienko).
 The idea that consumers compensate for not having status is strictly represente
d as risk-taking consumers compensate by taking unlikely risks.
 The consumer gets utility from her own relative wealth as well.
 The band-membership represents the non-transactional advantages of consumers
 - that do affect the consumer's wealth - albeit indirectly.
 The poor want to associated with the rich by status consumption because
 it provides a certain promise of gaining non-transactionally.
 The rich want not to be associated with the poor because they fear that
 they may be disadvantaged.
 Our model is different from Cole Maliath in two fundamental ways - first
 we consider the long-term implications of the equilibrium - second we utility
 association with asset-accumulation.
 Income distributions matter in Cole-Maliath (and Korenienko).
 We look at huge significant differences in income distribution caused by
 regional or social barriers.
 We believe that this cannot be understood without a probability formulation
 - because utility from matching does involve consideration of probability.
 Desire for status is about aligning oneself with this probability - while
 simultanesouly choosing higher assets.
 We also allow - with a simpler formulation - for societies to differ in
 the degrees of their rat races.
 The raison d'etre of disposable income bands are the really long-term effects
 which consumers accept but have no control over (non-transactional aspects)[als
o see Krupka-Weber].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noindent
Compared to Kornienko, we do visit the long-term questions (see paper).
 We do not assume that the quality is distributed with a known distribution
 - but use the conditions of long-term stability of the tournament to to
 obtain some properties of the tournament.
 INCOME IS NOT NECESSARILY PRIVATE IN THIS MODEL (hopkins korenienko assume
 continuum of rewards as well - see Which inequality).
 We look at long-term conditions but only to motivate that long-term conditions
 are not possible and that short-term equilibria do not need to satisfy
 the long-term requirements of stability.
 The relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, assets and income bands are thus assumed exogenous.
 A certain 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 need not imply long-term stability.
 Winners in the tournament get monetary benefit - which determine status.
 We expose the consumer not taking part in the competition to a risk of
 being thrown into a lower band - this is key to adjusting to bring L+W=1.
 We use the utility under risk to understand - by explicit representation
 of the returns from competitions (which could be depend on the specific
 tournament - different competitions would have different probabilities).
 The incentive effect is modelled by the authors using the dispersion order.

\begin_layout Standard
Many equilibria are possible the separating equilibria could be dependent
 on the degrees of risk-aversion.
 We use an alternative formulation of rank-preserving changes.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
On one hand, status goods are those that indicate a consumer's exclusive
 status while on the other, they create bandwagons for those with low status.
 To understand this universal race to exclusivity, status consumption has
 often been associated with the consumer's reference group.
 When all consumers are set to benefit from higher status consumption, reference
 groups help pin down a certain level of status consumption as the consumers'
 social need.
 They clarify empirically whether a given status item is more valuable to
 those who already have higher status or to those who don't (e.g.
 by asking which reference groups the consumers in comparison may belong
 to).
 Lastly, the association helps answer whether the not-so-rich spend disproportio
nately higher on status items in an economy or that the high spending on
 status goods is limited to the rich.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 This is particularly important since the consumer's social need for status
 items is hardly as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.
 With social needs determined by the consumer's interaction with others
 in the economy, the demand for status items necessarily depends on social
 participation and exclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-transactional environments of consumer choice and the uncertainty
 inherent in perception of status have been explored in the literature on
 status consumption - most particularly by Cole-Maliath and Hopkins-Kornienko.
 In the proposed chapter, we rely on the framework to explore consumer choice
 under extreme income inequalities that may develop due to geographic, occupatio
nal or social differences.
 We take an approach similar to Cole-Maliath in assuming that consumer does
 not obtain utility directly from the reference but through variables in
 her utility that are shaped by her reference.
 We focus in particular on the uncertainty arising out of non-transactional
 choices that contribute to the consumer's future expectations from status
 competitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of our argument is that if status goods - such as jewelry or a
 club membership - offered status utility that is not any more uncertain
 than the purchase from savings of the expensive long-term assets such as
 a house or a private jet, the representative consumer would know of the
 futility of status consumption (compared to saving towards higher wealth).
 The substitution between saving and consumption in the intertemporal substituti
on framework is therefore not suitable for understanding status consumption
 unless one considers either i) that the consumer's utility is subject to
 the risk implied by status consumption or ii) that the status items offer
 a utility different from the one that is derived from regular goods.
 While the latter option of splitting utility into visible and non-visible
 terms has its advantages, we find that the distinctions between items that
 provide status utility and those that provide regular utility may be more
 difficult to justify under environments of extreme income inequalities
 (e.g.
 in developing economies where relative wealth is more easily visible).
 This motivates the proposed approach to viewing status consumption as the
 consumer's risky position in an intertemporal framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like Hopkins-Kornienko - who explore status competitions for a given distributio
n of success-determining attributes in a population of consumers - we consider
 the inequality in rewards different from inequality in incomes in a specific
 instance of persistent (long-term) income inequalities.
 With near-permanent income inequalities, the consumer's hope to overcome
 the persistent inequality coincides with the promise of status competitions
 where status consumption is rewarded.
 In an approach similar to Cole-Maliath, we use a finite set of income bands
 so that the transition probabilities among them determine the future wealth
 states of the consumer and her expectations towards the future.
 The basic needs of the consumer are supposed to be already met in this
 economy so that the only option the consumer faces is to either save towards
 future assets or spend her income above needs towards status consumption.
 A fundamental assumption for the transition probability is that it encompasses
 all possible paths which a consumer could follow to rise in the hierarchy
 of income bands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model we develop, the utility from the consumer's future wealth consists
 both of the current value of assets and the probability of being in the
 same or different income-bands in the future.
 We assume that the probabilities that define the transition to successive
 income bands are the same for all consumers within an income band.
 Further, the consumers are meant to discover their success only through
 performance in the status competitions.
 Over time, the preferences as well as the success-determining attributes
 of the consumers remain unchanged as they transition across income bands.
 We also consider the implications of long-term inequalities on the equilibria
 assuming that the population of consumers in the income bands does not
 change over time.
 While the processes of accumulation and inheritance ensure that the assets
 acquired by consumers in various income bands do grow apart over time,
 they also imply a certain mobility through status competitions for all
 participants in order to assist fairness and stability among the income
 bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the status of the consumer is encompassed
 solely by the assets she would amass in a probable future.
 Therefore, the status comparisons are based not on the total assets at
 a time but the expected assets within a certain time-horizon.
 By means of an example, consider a classical musician who may be perceived
 to have a higher status than a country musician even though the latter
 has amassed a higher fortune.
 While all consumers are meant to maximise their assets acquisitions, a
 higher status can be associated to the classical musician in the model
 since it is the expected wealth over a finite time horizon that represents
 status (the rich consumers also bear a possibility of decline).
 The comparison between the two musicians depends foremost on whether they
 are in the same income band or not.
 When they are in the same income band, they participate in the same status
 competitions and the classical musician could - while relying on sublimity
 of her music and a sophistication curated over centuries - be more prepared
 for being in a higher income-band.
 Similarly, when the classical musician belongs to the poorer income band,
 the possibility that the poorer musician may have higher status is not
 completely ruled out either (when the classical consumer is in a richer
 band, her higher status is trivially implied).
 Even though being in a poorer income band implies that most classical musicians
 have a lower status than most country musicians (the listeners having a
 higher preference for classical musicians cannot result in lower income
 for classical musicians over time), the higher attribution of status for
 a poorer classical musician is possible if for example there is a popular
 association of decadence with the riches and thus a lower future expectation
 of wealth (in a finite time horizon).
 This notion of status similar to the status-is-wealth equilibria described
 by Cole-Maliath.
 Associating the matching process from Cole-Maliath with a transition in
 income bands, we also account for the poorer consumer having a propensity
 to remain within her income band due to the localised notions of status.
 This is permitted by letting the consumer with lower assets in a poorer
 band have a higher utility than she would for the same level of assets
 in a richer band.
 In the proposed formulation of status under extreme income differences
 with stable band populations, we find that status consumption are intensified
 as the income inequalities rise in an economy.

Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of our model is to look at how the demand for status consumption
 changes under an environment of disparate clusters of disposable income.
 The consumer identity to these distinct bands implies different disposable
 incomes to the consumer.
 This is equivalent to the more commonly used assumption of wealth growing
 at a constant growth rate - where a similar clustering of wealth would
 imply immense variation in interest income across bands.
 The separation of consumers among income bands means that being in the
 band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 provides disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in a given period to the consumer.
 The choice which the consumer faces is to either save to gain the utility
 from assets staying in their income band or spend a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 out of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to participate in a status competition which would promote her to a higher
 income band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the income bands range from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in an economy, the promotion of a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to the next income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 is provided with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the highest band 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer could also be demoted to an immediate lower income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the lowest band 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected utility from the future assets in the respective
 income bands she may be in the future.
 The incomes are distinguished based solely upon rewards of status competitions
 i.e.
 the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1...n}$
\end_inset

 that are provided in the respective income band (the disposable income
 excludes the cost of a consumer's needs and is the same for all consumers
 in a particular asset-band).
 We summarise the assumption as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:def_band"

\end_inset

The incomes bands are characterised only by the levels of disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final goal of every consumer in the model is to have the highest assets
 in the economy.
 Since the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every band can be used to accumulate towards assets or participate in
 tournaments of unobserved ability, the wealth differences among consumers
 in this economy arise either due to differences in starting assets or due
 to performance in status competitions.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the status competitions are provided structurally by the social institutions
 to grant some mobility across income bands while not completely getting
 rid of the stratification that prevents more participation.
 A success in status competitions serves both as an evidence of ability
 and as a barrier to entry for those with less proven abilities.
 The ability pertinent to one's status may be innate, unobserved and responsible
 for success in the status competitions, but it is relevant only through
 probabilistic monetary success in the long-term and is revealed to the
 consumer only through status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As chance favours the prepared, more status consumption increases the probabilit
y of one's successes in the status competitions through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and decreases that of failure 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is defined so that a consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is rewarded more often and so that no amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can ever provide guarantee to be in the next band (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 are assumed to have the same structure across income bands (
\begin_inset Formula $\forall k$
\end_inset

) except due to thresholds relevant for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in every income-band.
 In other words, the outlier performers in every band would be dispersed
 with the same distribution in the long-term equilibrium while the consumers
 would maintain different levels of status consumption in every band to
 have a chance to be promoted to the higher band.
 A lower band (e.g.
 a poorer underlcass in an economy or a poorer country in the global economy)
 may thus have a lower base-consumption (e.g.
 mean) on status goods (or cheaper status goods) but the outperformers in
 a poor environment are expected to improve their fortunes through the same
 mechanism that a consumer in a higher-income band (or in a richer country)
 would.
 This is a fundamental assumption for the status competitions in the model
 that determines the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:natural_competition"

\end_inset

The mechanism for the competitions are fundamentally the same across all
 bands except for differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

-reference levels pertaining to each band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in Section in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the consumers of varying characteristics (age, skills, talent etc.) observe
 the same likelihood of promotion to the next band as long as they are in
 the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 - so that 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 offer exactly the same probability to all the consumers in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Further, since the status competitions in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 to be promoted to band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are not open to any consumers in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that is lower than the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

, it follows that for a consumer to be in a band higher than the next she
 must go through the next band.
 We thus state the following implication of the above assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "cor:sequential_rise"

\end_inset

A consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can reach to another band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 only by going through bands 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1,...,j-1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Corollary 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cor:sequential_rise"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 implies a Markovian property for the consumer's future utility from assets.
 Status is the expected future utility at any point that the consumers optimise
 with the income received in their income band by either staying in the
 same band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or having moved to any of the bands different from their own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Long-term Equilibria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to incorporate the implications of persistent long-term inequalities
 in the model, we now consider what a long-term equilibrium with stable
 populations of consumers in the income bands would mean for status competitions.
 While symmetric Nash Equilibiria can be proven to exist in similar situations,
 we are also concerned with the conditions imposed by the long-term equilbria
 - since the income inequalities in the context we evaluatre are meant to
 be as long-term as the status competitions themselves.
 To understand the implications of both long-term inequalities and status
 competitions, consider first that without any status consumption, the disparate
 disposable incomes across two bands cannot provide a stable long-term equilibri
um due to the ever-growing gaps in accumulated wealth.
 More specifically, the accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=\sum_{t}^{T}\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the disposable income for the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}=y_{i}\forall t$
\end_inset

 ) would lead to unstable differences in accumulated wealth across bands
 over time.
 This is no different from the assumption of stable growth of assets where
 too the different starting assets would imply disparate interest-incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Long-term means 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu),W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 would remain the same for the entire time]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could thus say that the presence of status competitions allows the income
 inequalities to prevail.
 If the preferences for all consumers are the same, an equilibrium is implied
 in an economy with different bands of disposable incomes if the consumers
 can move across bands.
 Since long-term inequalities in income are persistent through the long-term
 equilibrium, the status competitions which the consumers participate in
 must be population-preserving in the sense that in the long-run the number
 of consumers who leave an income band must be balanced by those who enter
 the income band.
 An equilibrium with long-term income inequalities cannot exist if not for
 such a population preserving status competition.
 We thus observe the status competitions within such a population preserving
 mechanism - equivalent to a scheme where an equal number of consumers are
 selected in successive bands and swapped with each other at a certain cost
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:WinnersandlosersChainExchange"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The presence of status consumption implies that the richer band would spend
 proportionately higher on status competitions and the long-term equilibrium
 would sustain income inequalities across the bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we elaborate this result in more formal terms, notice that the asset
 accumulations of the consumers would necessarily spread around if the consumers
 were randomly selected to be swapped between income bands.
 As long as all consumers eventually get a fair chance to participate in
 the exchange, a stable equilibrium would allow assets to spread around
 consumers in different bands.
 This is because the consumers would be wary of giving up more by losing
 their current band when they move up the income bands and care less about
 losing their current band as they won't risk being shunned in the lowest
 bands.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed status competitions are hardly random and are more often characterised
 by how they favour those with higher expenditure within a band.
 With all else being the same, higher education expenditure or club memberships
 in a life-time has higher likelihood of social mobility.
 In our model, the success in competitions is driven through exogenous 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 alone.
 The swap mechanism - where the same number of consumers are exchanged between
 successive income bands - ensures the stability of populations of income
 bands in both long-run and the short-run.
 The assets are carried over so the selection of winners and losers does
 move the wealth around to some extent.
 Whether status competitions offer mobility or not in the model - depends
 on how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the competitions characterised by 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 really are.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that unlike the Hopkins-Kornienko approach, we don't assume an existing
 distribution of success-determining qualities.
 Instead, we rely on specific forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 in the model.
 The past success itself is the only relevant determinant of success and
 the consumer identity in the model.
 The essential argument using this approach is that in real-world cicrcumstances
, such as occupational or marriage markets, the consumers know about their
 abilities only through participation (through expenditures in education
 or social activities) where their past success as well as starting wealth
 determine their future decisions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 In this sense, the model is more similar to the matching described by Cole-Mali
ath.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or if the trivial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\tau}=0$
\end_inset

 is met (the latter is a special case of the former).
 The former condition for the stationarity imply the following
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\begin{pmatrix}y_{1}-\nu_{1}^{*} & y_{2}-\nu_{2}^{*}\end{pmatrix} & =\begin{pmatrix}y_{1}-\nu_{1}^{*} & y_{2}-\nu_{2}^{*}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1-W_{1}(\nu_{1}) & L_{2}(\nu_{2})\\

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stationary condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{\tau}{}B\rightarrow\prescript{\tau+1}{}B$
\end_inset

 can be achieved only if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}-\nu_{1}^{*}=y_{2}-\nu_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the consumers choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 so that their income excluding the status consumption is the same.
 This implies that the higher income band must maintain a high status consumptio
n and thus higher risk for there to be a stable equilibrium (which is true
 regardless of any exchange scheme implied by 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

).
 However, this also means that the differences in assets would continue
 to grow indefinitely.
 If income bands are as stable as the status competitions that support them,
 such an equilibrium cannot sustain status competitions.
 The latter condition 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\tau}=0$
\end_inset

 on the other hand implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{1}^{*})=1-L_{2}(\nu_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

 - which is the direct implication of population-preserving swap mechanism
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FullChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Simply put, a low winning probability in the long-run must be compensated
 by high losing probability to provide no average net benefit to the consumer
 in the long-run.
 This equilibrium sustains the differences in disposable income across bands.
 The long-term equilibrium in the two-band case therefore necessarily imply
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu_{1})+L_{2}(\nu_{2})=1$
\end_inset

 in the long-run where 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1},\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the consumer choices for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the long-run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this means for the symmetric Nash equilbria is that the participating
 consumers can only have finite-horizons - since any infinite-horizon equilibriu
m must follow the long-term implications due to Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:markov_transition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu),L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 need not be the same in each of the finite-horizon chosen by the consumers.
 Thus in the two-state case in one period, we may have 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu_{1})>L_{2}(\nu_{2})-1$
\end_inset

 (when consumer in the band 1 gain more often than consumers in band 2 lose)
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu_{1})<L_{2}(\nu_{2})-1$
\end_inset

 (when consumers in the band 2 lose more often than consumers in band 1
 gain).
 In other words, status competitions allow the wealth to travel in either
 direction even though a infinite-horizon equilibrium may have a zero net-transi
tion for there to be sustained differences in income bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In comparison to the model used by Hopkins-Kornienko, the relation between
 income and assets (value optimised by the consumer) is fixed as we observe
 the change in ranks as the consumer optimise future wealth.
 At the end of the fixed-horizon, the consumers select another set of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 in each band and carry over the assets accumulated from past promotions
 and demotions.

\begin_layout Standard
To explore short-term Nash equilibria in the population-preserving status
 competitions, we assume that the consumers optimise total assets accumulated
 subject to their band-reference in a single-period.
 In other words, the consumer just has one life and a one shot-investment
 to make towards her life-time status.
 As mentioned before, the consumer receives a higher utility from the same
 value of assets if she is in a poorer band compared to when she is in a
 richer band.
 It is worth emphasising that the utility to the consumer considers the
 total assets acquired by the consumer rather than the new income received
 in successive period.
 Finally, the consumers are assumed to save everything up at the end of
 first period i.e.
 they do not spend on status consumption at the end of their lives.
 This holds for when higher number of periods are considered - the consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 in the last period is always zero for all the consumers regardless of how
 much wealth they have amassed.

 down and requires a higher amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 to have a matching 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The status consumption seem to intensify as the income gap grows.
 As suppressing 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 both increase status consumption in the model, the argument that lower
 relative incomes may give the consumers more incentives to improve their
 well-being may still hold but only as long as the status competitions are
 feasible.
 Equivalently for 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

, increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 implies less 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 required in the short-term equilibrium for security of staying in the band
 (i.e.
 consumers in band 2 care less about losing their band) and increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 shifts 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 down and requires more 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 to be put up by consumers for them to preserve their band identity.
 Once again, the narrowing of income bands decreases status consumption
 - as if closer incomes gaps were to cause less

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the role which 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{2}$
\end_inset

 play towards consumer choice, we find that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 decreases the status consumption as it brings more utility from having
 less assets.
 Equivalently, increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{2}$
\end_inset

 requires more 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 and increases the status consumption - by increasing the perceived benefits
 from being in a higher income band.
 With the starting wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 itself, we see that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 lowers the required 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 while decreasing

 raises the required

 up and lower the required

 Similarly, low 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 With higher assets to start with, the consumers are expected to be less
 worried about asset loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above model predicts that the narrowing of income would reduce status
 consumption as well as the risk with future assets.
 Since there are limits to how much savings alone can improve the consumer's
 wealth, taking more risk through status consumption is hardly a waste for
 the consumer in the model.
 The risk through status competitions in fact works to reduce asset inequality.
 One could argue therefore that a policy that intend to improve savings
 (i.e.
 increase 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 alone) but does not spur status consumption should fail to counter the
 effects of intrinsic income inequalities which may in turn be a result
 of persistent long-term geographic or social barriers.

Combined Long term and Short-term Behaviour
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the short-term equilibria could imply a long-term redistribution of
 assets through status competitions depends on how 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 are set up relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 For example, when 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is high relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

, the consumers in the lower band (band 1) get rewarded more often than
 when the consumers in the richer band (band 2) lose.
 The asset differences would thus necessarily improve for the consumers
 in the lower band even though the income differences remain the same.
 Likewise, when 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is high relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 a consumer in the richer band (band 2) lose more often than when the consumer
 in the lower band gain a position in the band, and the relative differences
 in assets also get reduced.
 Since less asset differences have the effect of making status competitions
 less intense, it follows that the long-term stability and equity is not
 ruled out through the short-term equilibria.

\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{0})>L(\nu_{0})$
\end_inset

 then from the solution equations (the extra terms corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $L(0),W(0)$
\end_inset

), consumers would lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 but raise 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Higher 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{0})$
\end_inset

 would bump the RHS up and require lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$

 Letting

 same for the entire-long term - is akin to focusing on a family of 
\begin_inset Formula $L,W$
\end_inset

 rather than a general 
\begin_inset Formula $L,W$
\end_inset

.
 If we don't fix 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu_{0})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{0})$
\end_inset

 then we cannot consider the summation to a long-term solution.

 and

 This class of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 means that with no status consumption, the consumer would not move up.
 Similalrly, 
\begin_inset Formula $L(0)=1$
\end_inset

 means that the consumer is sure to lose her position if she does not have
 status consumption.
 This also means that the consumers would both never choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=0$

 since that would break the long-term constraint (accumulation of disposable
 incomes alone is not sustainable).

\begin_layout Standard
More detailed outcomes could be explored in the above set up if we assume
 a certain distribution of attributes that determine success in competitions
 and a specific scheme of selecting winners and losers.
 A game-theoretic interpretation like Hopkins-Kornienko could thus be used
 to experiment with specific forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 represented by a scheme of selecting winners and losers based on expenditure
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 In summary, we find that despite limiting restrictions of the long-term
 equilibrium implied by persistent income differences, the finite-horizon
 equilibria could exist for status competitions defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and can neutralise the severity of relative income differences by distributing
 assets over time.

1.
 It considers 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}/\Gamma_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 - For interpretation, know that the model considers betting as the only

 If the differences in income are permanent, then the consumers would not
 want to compete with the higher income group by saving.
 The real interaction is between 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}/\Gamma_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, then.
 We can say that the utility from being poor may be more significant when
 communication increases i.e.
 the consumer no longer feels content in the poor.
 That does not change the usual dynamics of rewards - neither the long-term

 What happens over the multiple short-term equilibria i.e.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 The distinction between waste and upward mobility does seem to be obfuscated
 in this model.
 That's because the difference is not always clear in the real-world (because
 consumers consider something a waste only after reconciling their past
 expenditure).
 The extreme income differences have the role of segregating as well - because
 consumers don't spend on anything (or are influenced by things) that would
 improve the lives of the band above them.
 There is a practical utility from the status consumption in the real world
 - while we don't distinguish between waste and means for upward mobility,
 we argue that the status consumption is necessitated by this struggle and
 is wasteful only in the wider context - not in the narrow status comparison
 reference where it is necessitated.
 Faced with income inequalities, the consumers must weigh the local hierarchy
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

) against the status advantages.
 Our interpretation for status consumption consider both 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W,L$
\end_inset

 .
 Increases in inequalities might increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}$

 in a way that makes more inequalities acceptable (and vice versa).

 In this scheme, the consumer takes

[Finite Horizon] The most important question for the finite horizon model
 is what the consumer does with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=T$
\end_inset

.
 Does she avail the final income and pass it on to the progeny (who would
 make her own decisions anyways) - or instead sees no point in accumulating
 and wants to bet it all on mobility.
 The latter would require she has more hope in stability of bands than assets.
 But we believe otherwise.
 Income and status competitions are less stable.
 Since we have the idea of the LTE and STE now, we acknowledge the short-termism
 by choosing an STE and thus it makes more sense to save at the end.
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 emulates the life-time or the time-horizon of the consumer - the imagined
 end of the world where LTE would start is where SC won't matter at all.
 If indeed income bands and status competitions were naturally observed
 phenomenon, we would have the equilbrium where differences 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{t}$
\end_inset

 stabilises, but both status competitions and income bands are man-made
 that are less stable than the long-term assets that consumers accumulate
 (through technological advancement or qualities in the market that would
 sustain status competitions)( see Kornienko).

Contrast with the conventional Approach

\begin_layout Standard
In the conventional approach of the intertemporal substitution, we would
 argue that there is an observed rate of growth of assets which the consumer
 - but this interest rate is a huge assumption it works only because we
 want to observe consumption against long-term economic growth.
 That consumers differentiate between items for status also because their
 is a need associated with reference is discarded by the blanket assumption
 that all assets must grow and thus all consumption gives a felicity.
 All non-assets need not be consumed but invested in different streams -
 education is a different consumption from jewelry and so on.
 We therefore consider reference to be of key importance.
 That consumers must optimise value with respect to reference provides a
 better view of status consumption and does not require status consumption
 to be futile.
 Only fixing a function 
\begin_inset Formula $J(nu)$

 would tell us how soon the game would end etc..

[COMPARISON with intertemporal model does not arise in two-period models]
 At this point it is worth contrasting this approach with the typical intertempo

 consumption as a bet towards the final asset-band.
 So we have assumed a risk-neutral consumer who only ....

The typical intertemporal substitution model also assumes the opposite of
 what have by using the assumption that nothing survives of the assets except

 What we're saying is that only that all consumption and accumulation must
 go to asset-band identity.
 That is like saying that effective wealth is zero at the end and the assets
 grow at a certain rate.
