Compared to Oxoby, 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 has a direct role and is based on subjective lack of knowledge of the world.
 It is only through competitions that consumer form their identity and would
 make fairly random decisions before.
 Therefore they would put 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 thinking they have a fair chance of being a winner.
 That the long-term equilibrium does not allow that does not matter - since
 the consumers think it does not affect them.
 Unlike in Oxoby, a poor decision affects them monetarily if they make a
 bad decision (what does their fixed-horizon equilibrium imply) and they
 don't really get any non-monetary utility.
 Like Cole-Maliath - they get only monetary benefit.
 Status is implied only through the assets somebody acquires - a view that
 is fundamentally dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $W,L$
\end_inset

 (see Kornienko).
 The idea that consumers compensate for not having status is strictly represente
d as risk-taking consumers compensate by taking unlikely risks.
 The consumer gets utility from her own relative wealth as well.
 The band-membership represents the non-transactional advantages of consumers
 - that do affect the consumer's wealth - albeit indirectly.
 The poor want to associated with the rich by status consumption because
 it provides a certain promise of gaining non-transactionally.
 The rich want not to be associated with the poor because they fear that
 they may be disadvantaged.
 Our model is different from Cole Maliath in two fundamental ways - first
 we consider the long-term implications of the equilibrium - second we utility
 association with asset-accumulation.
 Income distributions matter in Cole-Maliath (and Korenienko).
 We look at huge significant differences in income distribution caused by
 regional or social barriers.
 We believe that this cannot be understood without a probability formulation
 - because utility from matching does involve consideration of probability.
 Desire for status is about aligning oneself with this probability - while
 simultanesouly choosing higher assets.
 We also allow - with a simpler formulation - for societies to differ in
 the degrees of their rat races.
 The raison d'etre of disposable income bands are the really long-term effects
 which consumers accept but have no control over (non-transactional aspects)[als
o see Krupka-Weber].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noindent
Compared to Kornienko, we do visit the long-term questions (see paper).
 We do not assume that the quality is distributed with a known distribution
 - but use the conditions of long-term stability of the tournament to to
 obtain some properties of the tournament.
 INCOME IS NOT NECESSARILY PRIVATE IN THIS MODEL (hopkins korenienko assume
 continuum of rewards as well - see Which inequality).
 We look at long-term conditions but only to motivate that long-term conditions
 are not possible and that short-term equilibria do not need to satisfy
 the long-term requirements of stability.
 The relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, assets and income bands are thus assumed exogenous.
 A certain 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 need not imply long-term stability.
 Winners in the tournament get monetary benefit - which determine status.
 We expose the consumer not taking part in the competition to a risk of
 being thrown into a lower band - this is key to adjusting to bring L+W=1.
 We use the utility under risk to understand - by explicit representation
 of the returns from competitions (which could be depend on the specific
 tournament - different competitions would have different probabilities).
 The incentive effect is modelled by the authors using the dispersion order.

\begin_layout Standard
Many equilibria are possible the separating equilibria could be dependent
 on the degrees of risk-aversion.
 We use an alternative formulation of rank-preserving changes.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
On one hand, status goods are a meant to indicate a consumer's exclusive
 status while on the other, they are also meant to create bandwagons for
 those with lower status.
 To understand this supposed universal race to exclusivity, status consumption
 has been often associated with the consumer's reference group.
 Without that, it is difficult to understand how the not-so-rich are observed
 to spend disproportionately higher on status items while the high-status
 individuals also spend more on status goods.
 Where all consumers are supposed to benefit from higher status consumption,
 reference groups help us pin down a certain level of status consumption
 as the consumers' social need.
 In empirical terms, they help clarify whether a given status item is more
 valuable to those who already have higher 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or to those who don't (e.g.
 by asking whether the consumers belong to the same reference group or not).
 Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 may identify her status.
 This is important - since the consumer's social need for status items is
 hardly as universal as for essential food or clothing.
 Since social needs are determined by the consumer's interaction with others
 in the economy, the demand for status items necessarily depends on social
 participation and exclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-transactional environments of consumer choice and the uncertainty
 inherent in perception of status have already been explored in the literature
 on status consumption - most particularly by Cole-Maliath and Hopkins-Kornienko.
 In the proposed chapter, we extend rely on this framework to explore consumer
 choice under extreme income inequalities and take an approach similar to
 Cole-Maliath in assuming that consumer does not obtain utility directly
 from the reference but through variables in her utility that are shaped
 by her reference.
 We focus in particular on the uncertainty arising out of non-transactional
 choices that contribute to the consumer's future expectations from status
 competitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of our argument is that if status goods - such as jewelry or a
 club membership - offered returns towards status that are not any more
 uncertain than the purchase of expensive long-term assets such as a house
 or a private jet, the representative consumer would know of the futility
 of status consumption (compared to saving towards higher wealth).
 The substitution between saving and consumption in the intertemporal substituti
on framework is therefore not suitable for understanding status consumption
 unless one considers either i) that the consumer's utility is subject to
 the risk implied by status consumption or ii) that the status items offer
 a utility different from the one that is derived from regular goods.
 While the latter option of splitting utility into visible and non-visible
 terms has its advantages, we find that the distinctions between items or
 status and regular utility may be more difficult to justify empirically
 under environments of extreme income inequalities (e.g.
 in developing economies where relative wealth is more easily visible).
 This motivates the proposed approach to viewing status consumption as the
 consumer's risky position in an intertemporal framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is similar to the approach followed by Hopkins-Kornienko who explore
 status competitions for a given distribution of success-determining attributes
 in a population of consumers.
 It is worth emphasising that the inequality in rewards is considered different
 from inequality in incomes - a distinction that we also make for our specific
 instance of persistent (long-term) income inequalities caused due to geographic
, occupational or social differences.
 With near permanent income inequalities, the consumer's hope to overcome
 the persistent inequality coincides with the promise of status competitions
 where status consumption is rewarded.
 In an approach similar to Cole-Maliath, we use a finite set of income bands
 and the transition probabilities among them determine the future wealth
 states of the consumer and her expectations towards the future.
 The basic needs of the consumer are supposed to be already met in this
 economy so that the only option she faces is to either save towards future
 assets or spend her income above needs towards status consumption.
 The fundamental assumption for the transition probability is that it encompasse
s all possible paths which a consumer could follow rise in the hierarchy
 of income.
 The utility from future wealth thus consists both of the current value
 of assets and the probability of being in the same or different income-bands
 in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the probabilities that define the transition to successive income
 bands is assumed to be the same for all consumers within an income band.
 As consumers discover their success only through performance in the status
 competitions, the preferences and attributes of the consumers in an income
 band remain unchanged as consumers transition across bands.
 If the population of consumers in the income bands does not change over
 time, the processes of accumulation and inheritance would ensure on one
 hand that the assets acquired by consumers in various income bands would
 grow apart over time, but on the other that a certain mobility for all
 participants in the economy is permitted through status competitions to
 assist inclusion, fairness and stability among the bands.
 In other words the consumers in the higher income-band with the higher
 income maintain a competition to admit those below the respective band
 to become a member.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
The status of the consumer at any rime in the model is encompassed by the
 assets she would amass in a probable future.
 The comparison between status 
\bar default
of two consumer's is thus based not on the total assets they currently own
 but the expected assets in the future 
\bar under
with a certain time-horizon
\bar default
.
 This allows us to explicitly model the reference-dependence of status.
 Consider for example, a classical musician who is considered by some to
 be of a higher status than the country musician even though the classical
 musician has a lower accumulated wealth.
 This is acceptable in the model as we are interested in the expected wealth
 over time and argue that consumers behave based on the future states over
 time.
 For the status comparison between the classical and countyr musicians,
 there are only two possibilities when such a comparison is evaluated.
 The first possibility is when both the musicians are in the same income
 band.
 If so, the classical musician participates in a competition for status
 just the same way as the country musician - hoping for an future material
 growth (however unlikely) relying on the qualities of sublimity of classical
 music curated over a centuries of elite patronage.
 The status comparison depends not only on the net worth or income through
 labour (presumably higher for the country musician) but also on how prepared
 the musician is to be in the next/higher income-band.
 More solid foundations and a sophistication to build future social networks
 may be evaluated higher for those projecting futures states of the two
 musicians and would thus justify a higher status for the classical musician.
 The second possibility is that the classical musician and country musicians
 do not belnog to the same income bands.
 The case when the classical consumer is in a richer band is trivial but
 when the classical musician is in a poorer income band, the possibility
 that the poorer musician would have higher status is also possible.
 As such the consumers having a higher preference for classical musicians
 cannot result in lower income for classical musicians.
 But while most classical musicians may have lower status than most country
 musicians (due to differences in income), an association of decadence among
 the rich is not ruled out.
 In both cases, the expectation of the consumer's wealth over a given period
 of time is what determines the notion of status (This is the status-is-wealth
 equilibria described in the Cole-Maliath view).
 To account the poorer consumer having a prepopensity to remain within her
 income band - 
\bar under
due to localised notions of status - we allow a consumer with lower assets
 in a poorer band to have a higher utility than she would for the same wealth
 in a richer band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the formulation of status as wealth under uncertainty, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

having status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not a prerequisite for participating in status competitions.
 If indeed only those with status needed to spend on status goods, we would
 see no status consumption in societies as they moved towards equality.
 Instead, the empirical literature from Hirsch, Galbraith notes and the
 models from Hopkins predict, the improvement in median incomes seems must
 increase the focus on status items in the developed world.
 In this simple discrete formulation of status under extreme income differences,
 we find that status consumption are intensified with as the inequalities
 rise in the economy.

Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We represent the disparate groups in an economy that are spatially or socially
 segregated as distinct bands - belonging to which implies different disposable
 incomes for the consumer.
 Instead of assuming a constant growth rate for the consumer savings, we
 assume that the being in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 provides income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every period to the consumer.
 The consumer could either save towards the utility from assets in their
 income band or spend a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 out of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to participate in a status competition that would promote them to a higher
 income band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The promotion of a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to the next income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

- among 
\begin_inset Formula $1...n$
\end_inset

 income bands in an economy - is provided with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (this is not defined for the highest band 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer could also be demoted to an immediate lower income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (this is not defined for the lowest band 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer would thus choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected future asset value in the income bands she may
 be in the future.
 It is worth highlighting that income bands are distinguished based solely
 upon rewards i.e.
 the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1...n}$
\end_inset

 (which excludes the cost of a consumer's needs and is the same for all
 consumers in a particular asset-band).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:def_band"

\end_inset

The incomes bands are characterised only by the levels of disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[SC as a basic mechanism] The final goal of every consumer in the model
 is to have the highest assets in the economy.
 The disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every band can be used to accumulate towards assets or participate in
 tournaments of unobserved ability.
 The difference in wealth in this economy arise either due to differences
 in starting wealth or due to performance in status competitions.
 As discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the social institutions provide structural status competitions that provide
 some mobility at the same while stratification prevents more participation.
 Since the success in status competitions serves both as an evidence of
 ability and as a barrier to entry for those with less proven abilities,
 the success in status competitions carries both status and expected wealth
 in this economy (see the status-is-wealth equilibria in Cole-Maliath).
 The ability pertinent to one's status may be innate, unobserved and responsible
 for success in the status competitions, but it is relevant only through
 probabilistic monetary success in the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As chance favours the prepared, status consumption increases the probability
 of one's successes in the status competitions through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and decreases that of failure 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 A function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is defined so that a consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is rewarded more often and so that no amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can ever provide guarantee to be in the next band (
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

).
 The functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 are assumed to have the same structure across asset bands (
\begin_inset Formula $\forall k$
\end_inset

) except due to threshold relevant for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in every income-band.
 In other words, the distribution of outlier performers in every band is
 the same and the consumers are meant to maintain different levels of status
 consumption in every band to have a chance to be promoted to the higher
 band.
 A lower band (representing a poorer underlcass in an economy or a poorer
 country in the global economy) may thus have a lower base-consumption on
 status goods (or cheaper status goods) but the outperformers in a poor
 environment are expected to improve their fortunes through the same mechanism
 that a consumer in a higher-income band (or in a richer country) would.
 This is a fundamental assumption for the status competitions in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:natural_competition"

\end_inset

The mechanism for the competitions are fundamentally the same across all
 bands except for differences in reference levels pertaining to each band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in Section in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the consumers of varying characteristics (age, skills, talent etc.) observe
 the same likelihood of promotion to the next band as long as they are in
 the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 ( see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) since they discover themselves only through success in competitions.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 offer exactly the same probability for all consumers in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Also, since the status competitions in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 to be promoted to band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are not open to any consumers in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that is lower than the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, it follows that for a consumer to be in a band higher than the next she
 must go through the next band.
 The assumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 can thus be restated as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary

A consumer cannot in band

\begin_inset Formula $i+1,..,j-1$

\begin_layout Standard

 Status is the expected future wealth at any point that the consumers optimise
 with the income received in their asset band by either staying in the same
 band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or having moved to any of the bands higher than their own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Long-term Equilibria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to understand the implications of long-term inequalities, we intend
 to explore the implications for the long-term equilbiria using the above
 setup.
 While symmetric Nash Equilibiria are proven to exist in similar situations,
 we also wish to incoporate observations on long-term inequalities in the
 model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[INCOMES FIXED is Exponential change] To consider the long-term equilibiria
 implied by the above setup, notice first that the disparate disposable
 incomes across two bands cannot provide a long-term equilibrium.
 This is because accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=\sum_{t}^{T}\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the disposable income in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}=y_{i}\forall t$
\end_inset

 ) would lead to unstable differences in accumulated wealth across bands
 over time.
 This no different from the assumption of stable growth of assets in the
 intertemporal substitution problem where too different starting asset wealth
 across imply disparate interest-incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[SC - random] The presence of status competitions allow the income inequalities
 to prevail.
 If the preferences for all consumers are the same, an equilibrium is implied
 in an economy with different bands of disposable incomes if the consumers
 can move across bands for a certain cost.
 Since long-term inequalities in income are persistent through the long-term
 equilibrium, the status competitions which the consumers participate in
 must be population-preserving in the sense that in the long-run the number
 of consumers who leave the an income band must be balanced by those who
 enter the income band.
 The long-term income inequalities cannot exist if not for such a population
 preserving status competition.
 What such a population preserving competition implies is a scheme where
 into two successive bands are swapped with each other over time.
 The presence of status consumption implies the possibilty that the richer
 band would spend poportionately higher on status competitions and the long-term
 equilibrium would sustain income inequalities across the bands as well
 as the status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To elaborate this further, notice that the final state of the consumers
 wouldn't be any difference from with the swapping mechanism if they incurred
 no cost for status consumption.
 If however, a swap of consumers from two successive bands is at a certain
 and is reasonably fair (so that all consumers eventually get a fair chance
 to participate in the exchange), a stable equilibrium would allow consumers
 to spread their long-term assets.
 If for example, we randomly select winners and losers in every band and
 swap them for a certain cost, the consumers woud give up more as by losing
 their current band as they move up the income band.
 At the same time, less income does not necessarily shun the consumer to
 the lowest bands due the possibility of being randomly selected for being
 promoted to a higher band as a winner.

\begin_layout Standard
[With SC] Indeed status competitions are hardly random and are characterised
 by how they favour those with already high assets.
 In the model , the success in competitions is driven explicitly through
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 Further, we allow the consumer to have higher utility from the same assets
 in a lower income band than in a higher income band.
 Such an exchange mechanism ensures stable populations of bands in the equilibri
um (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In this swap mechanism - which ensure the stability of populations of income
 bands in both long-run and the short-run - the assets are carried over
 so the the random selection of winners and losers does move the wealth
 around.
 Whether status competitions offer mobility or not in the model, depends

 Instead, we view past success itself as the determinant of quality and

 know about their abilities only through participation (through expenditures
 in education or dating) and their past success as well as starting wealth
 itself determines future decisions of

 For the discussion in this section, we consider a simplified chain with
 only two income bands which the consumers can transition in between.
 This is shown in the Figure

 A Pareto equilibrium for the consumers in this simplified chain would consider
 choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$
\end_inset

 in bands 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and

\end_inset

 (see Figure

 ) that result in the optimal accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $E(A)=E_{k(}(\sum_{t}\prescript{t}{}\nu_{k})$
\end_inset

 for the consumers given a certain scheme of picking winners and losers
 (which are represented with 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$

 The Nash equilibrium for a consumer in band

 However, if we consider the long-term implications due to sustained inequalitie

[Chain Reduction] When a consumer can both be demoted and promoted over
 time, her expected future wealth would be expected income from future asset
 bands she can be in.
 In the Markov chain that is implied in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

 a consumer would evaluate her future state based on either of the future
 band she could be in with the respective probabilities associated with
 the transition.
 In the 2-band case, the consumer in band 1 could expect to have either
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 income in the next period with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $1-W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 In the period after next she could be in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}\rightarrow y_{1}$

Notice that

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}\in[0,y_{2}]$
\end_inset

 in the above model i.e.
 the consumer do not use anything from savings towards the status consumption.
 Let's assume that the consumer's assets are 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 before the start of period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 in band 1.
 In the period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 itself, the consumer would accumulate
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}+(y_{1}-\nu_{1})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 is her expenditure on status consumption.
 In the next period 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

, the consumer could either be in band 2 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu_{1})$
\end_inset

 or in band 1 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-W_{1}(\nu_{1})$
\end_inset

 .
 Therefore, her expected accumulation in the next period 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}+(y_{1}-\nu_{1})+W_{1}(\nu_{1})(y_{1}-\nu_{1})+(1-W_{1}(\nu_{1}))(y_{2}-\nu_{2})$

 This quantity comprises both of the savings from the period

There are only two ways a long-term equilbirium would be implied with the

 or if 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\tau}=0$
\end_inset

 in the long-run as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 (the latter being a special case of the former).
 The conditions for the stationarity (former condition) imply the following
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\begin{pmatrix}y_{1}-\nu_{1}^{*} & y_{2}-\nu_{2}^{*}\end{pmatrix} & =\begin{pmatrix}y_{1}-\nu_{1}^{*} & y_{2}-\nu_{2}^{*}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1-W_{1}(\nu_{1}) & L_{2}(\nu_{2})\\

(y_{1}-\nu_{1}^{*})L_{2}(\nu_{2}^{*})+(1-L_{2}(\nu_{2}^{*}))(y_{2}-\nu_{2}^{*})
\end{pmatrix}\label{eq:markov_transition}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stationary condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{\tau}{}B\rightarrow\prescript{\tau+1}{}B$
\end_inset

 can be achieved only if
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}-\nu_{1}^{*}=y_{2}-\nu_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the consumers choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 so that their income excluding the status consumption is the same.
 This implies that the higher income band must maintain a high status consumptio
n and thus higher risk for there to be a stable equilibrium (which is true
 regardless of any exchange scheme implied by 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

).
 However, this also means that the differences in assets would continue
 to grow indefinitely.
 If income bands are as stable as the status competitions that support them,
 such an equilibrium cannot sustain status competitions.
 The latter condition 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\tau}=0$
\end_inset

 on the other hand implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{1}^{*})=1-L_{2}(\nu_{2}^{*})$
\end_inset

 - which is the direct implication of population-preserving swap mechanism
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FullChain"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Simply put, a low winning probability in the long-run must be compensated
 by high losing probability to provide no average net benefit to the consumer
 in the long-run.
 This equilibrium sustains the differences in disposable income across bands.
 The long-term equilibrium in the two-band case therefore necessarily imply
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}+L_{2}=1$
\end_inset

 in the long-run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this means for the symmetric Nash equilbria is that participating consumers
 can only have finite-horizons - since any infinite-horizon equilibrium
 must follow the long-term implications due to Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:markov_transition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu),L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 also need not be the same in each of the finite-horizon chosen by the consumers.
 Thus in the two-state example considered in one period, we may have 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}>L_{2}-1$
\end_inset

 (when consumer in the band 1 gain more often than consumers in band 2 lose)
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}<L_{2}-1$
\end_inset

 (when consumers in the band 2 lose more often than consumers in band 1
 gain).
 In other words, status competitions are allow the wealth to travel in either
 direction even though a infinite-horizon equilibrium may have a zero net-transi
tion for there to be sustained differences in income bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Relationship with income and assets] In comparison to the model used by
 Hopkins-Kornienko, we use a scheme where the relation between income and
 assets (value optimised by the consumer) is fixed while we observe the
 change in ranks as the consumer optimise future wealth.
 At the end of the fixed-horizon, the consumers select another set of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in each band and carry over the assets accumulated from past promotions
 and demotions.

\begin_layout Subsection
Short-term Equilibria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Short-term horizon] Assuming that the consumer optimise total assets accumulate
d subject to her band-reference in a single-period (the consumer just has
 one life and one shot-investment to make towards her status bet), we consider
 the utility from future assets depending on one's band-reference - the
 consumer receives a higher utility from the same value of assets if she
 is a poorer band.
 It is worth emphasising the utility for the consumer considers total assets
 acquired by the consumer rather than the new income received in successive
 period.
 The consumers are assumed to save everything up towards not spent in status
 accumulation at the end of one-period (their lives).
 This holds for when higher number of periods are considered as well - i.e.
 the consumption in the last period is always zero for all the consumers
 regardless of how much wealth they have amassed.

 increasing

 down and requires higher amount

 Thus the status consumption seem to intensify as the income gap grows.
 Suppressing

 both increase status consumption in the mode.
 The argument that lower relative incomes may give the consumers more incentives
 to improve their well-being only holds as long as the consumers are assumed

 Similarly for

 shifts

 down requiring more money to be put up by consumers to preserve their status.

 decreases the status consumption as it brings more utility from having

 Equivalently, increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{2}$
\end_inset

 requires more

 and increases the status consumption as it increases the perceived benefits
 from being in a higher income band.

 lowers the required

 With higher assets to start with, the consumers would be less worried about
 asset loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Assets and Income change with savings and SC] The model predicts that the
 narrowing of income would reduce status consumption as well as the risk
 with future assets.
 Since there are limits to how much savings alone can improve consumer's
 wealth and taking more risk through status consumption is hardly a waste
 in the model.
 Instead, the risk through status competitions reduces asset inequality.
 The policies to that improve savings without spurring status consumption
 can therefore do nothing for the intrinsic income inequalities that are
 cause due to spatial or social barriers.
 Our model exaplins the restrictions that the long-term sustenance of inequaliti
es and distribution population across unequal bands would impose on status
 competitions.

[Assets and Income change with savings and SC] More specifically, when 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is high relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

, the consumers in the lower band (1) get rewarded more often than when
 the consumers in the richer band (2) lose.
 The asset differences would necessarily improve for the consumers in the
 lower band even though the income differences remain the same.
 Likewise, when 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu)$
\end_inset

 is high relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu)$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 a consumer in the richer band (2) lose more often than when the consumer
 in the lower band gain a position in the band, an the relative differences
 in assets also get reduced.
 Since less asset differences have the effect of making status competitions
 less intense, we would a long-term stability is possible through short-term
 equilibria.

 In summary, we find that the long-term equilibrium for stable income difference

[non-EUT consumer] The risk-aversion differences in the setup implied by
 is necessarily due to the curvature in consumer's expected utility i.e.
 through a given preference for probability.
 We can view the utility a simple 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x,p,\alpha)=\frac{log(x)p^{\alpha}}{p^{\alpha}+(1-p)^{\alpha}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the probability of gain and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a degree of risk-aversion so that a consumer with lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 would receive higher utility for the same 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

[Form of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)]$

 The

\end_inset

 of consumers are assumed to be distributed so only those with a higher
 very high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 are rewarded - others don't have the same probability.
 The logistic function 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{e^{-(\nu-\mu)/s}}{s(1+e^{-(\nu-\mu)/s})^{2}}$
\end_inset

 describes the pdf.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for a very high value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 cannot be a pdf.
 For high
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 we are meant to just understand the probability of being in the next band.
 Only those with very high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 would reach the next band and those .
 The consumers can be risk-averse or risk-seeking.
 So far we have assumed that choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 would give the consumer a

 as cdf mean? If we're talking about distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu>\bar{\nu})=1-P(\nu\le\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

) should decrease the probability of being in the next band.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\nu\le\bar{\nu})$
\end_inset

 is an increasing function by definition.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$

 The ordinal notion probabilstic utility is hardly suited for this purpose.
 The consumer is concerned with the increase in risk - this is a subjective
 notion.
 We choose Karmakar for this purpose.
 But the treatment of probability itself is independent of the subjective

 This would be only slightly more complicated in the case when there are
 more than two bands and the consumer chooses both

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$

 The probability that a consumer in band 1 would move to band 2 is the probabili
ty that there would be fewest consumers outperforming her in the status
 consumption i.e.

 This is where budget might come in handy - if the consumer simply want
 to maximise probability then she would always take the maximum.

[Finite Horizon] The most important question for the finite horizon model
 is what the consumer does with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=T$
\end_inset

.
 Does she avail the final income and pass it on to the progeny (who would
 make her own decisions anyways) - or instead sees no point in accumulating
 and wants to bet it all on mobility.
 The latter would require she has more hope in stability of bands than assets.
 But we believe otherwise.
 Income and status competitions are less stable.
 Since we have the idea of the LTE and STE now, we acknowledge the short-termism
 by choosing an STE and thus it makes more sense to save at the end.
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 emulates the life-time or the time-horizon of the consumer - the imagined
 end of the world where LTE would start is where SC won't matter at all.
 If indeed income bands and status competitions were naturally observed
 phenomenon, we would have the equilbrium where differences 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{t}$
\end_inset

 stabilises, but both status competitions and income bands are man-made
 that are less stable than the long-term assets that consumers accumulate
 (through technological advancement or qualities in the market that would
 sustain status competitions)( see Kornienko).

 So in the next period, the consumer would evaluate the following .

 are not high.
 So there is an incentive of not going beyond

 The consumer gets the highest probability when she is the only one above
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}$

 Otherwise she might want to take the risk of being in the lower band.
 Notice that she does not know the

 Out of the two general properties of the probability, the threshold mechanism
 does not guarantee higher utility for a consumer having a higher

[SWAP PROBABILITY] We have assumed that the winner gets to trade places

 in the other band (except if there is a general policy that guarantees
 a unison of some sort).
 When the consumer does not know the 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 she opens herself to be randomly swapped with somebody else.
 We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

 are fixed for all asset-bands in the equilibrium.
 Let's consider the loser in the next band who has decided on being a loser
 because she is not as worried about being a loser.
 In other words, by choosing a low 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, she is ready to be swapping places with somebody in the lower band and
 reset her wealth.
 She gives up her accumulations - which won't get her to the next band anyways
 - and accepts receiving a much lower income.
 In the threshold scheme, the option for a consumer who wants to stay in
 the same band is to keep the probability of swap low by not becoming the
 poorest in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

Contrast with the conventional Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the conventional approach of the intertemporal substitution, we would
 argue that there is an observed rate of growth of assets which the consumer
 - but this interest rate is a huge assumption it works only because we
 want to observe consumption against long-term economic growth.
 That consumers differentiate between items for status also because their
 is a need associated with reference is discarded by the blanket assumption
 that all assets must grow and thus all consumption gives a felicity.
 All non-assets need not be consumed but invested in different streams -
 education is a different consumption from jewelry and so on.
 We therefore consider reference to be of key importance.
 That consumers must optimise value with respect to reference provides a
 better view of status consumption and does not require status consumption
 to be futile.
 Only fixing a function 
\begin_inset Formula $J(nu)$
\end_inset

 would tell us how soon the game would end etc..
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[COMPARISON with intertemporal model does not arise in two-period models]
 At this point it is worth contrasting this approach with the typical intertempo
ral substitution approach where all assets must be consumed at the point.
 Our approach is similar except that it refines the utility from the final
 consumption as a bet towards the final asset-band.
 So we have assumed a risk-neutral consumer who only ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical intertemporal substitution model also assumes the opposite of
 what have by using the assumption that nothing survives of the assets except
 for the consumption.
 What we're saying is that only that all consumption and accumulation must
 go to asset-band identity.
 That is like saying that effective wealth is zero at the end and the assets
 grow at a certain rate.
