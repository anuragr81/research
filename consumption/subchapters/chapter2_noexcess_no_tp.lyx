\begin_layout Standard
Given that those without higher non-durable consumption have less status
 than those with higher assets, do consumers end up substituting expenditure
 on non-durable consumption with owning long-term assets?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We avoid the typical classification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal of this analysis is only to test whether the consumers
 in richer references use less relative quality (and vice versa) or not.

\begin_layout Standard
[Fundamental Needs are the same for the rich] We use the view of status
 as a context driven utility from consumption and wealth to argue also that
 the richer consumers do not have fundamentally different needs - but context-dr
iven costs of status indication.
 The reference dependent status consumption implies that there exists universal
 need of status consumption - but not that the fundamental needs themselves
 are higher for a richer consumer.
 For example, a rich neighborhood having high prices of food does not mean
 that the needs for food are costlier for the richer consumer (if that was
 true, an arbitrageur would take advantage to offer cheaper prices for food
 with the difference in prices for food explained accounted only by costs
 of transportation).
 If we can admit that consumers optimise life-style choices and goals higher
 than nutrition, then the higher costs on food are likely to be be intertwined
 with long-term choices of the consumer (which force her to be a neighborhood
 with higher food prices).
 More expenses on fundamental needs might be a consequence of availing higher
 status - rather than having different needs per se (this is explained by
 Maliath as non-transactional optimisations).

\begin_layout Standard
[Issues with Intertemporal Substitution] While the intertemporal substitution
 framework has been widely used in consumer economics, its applications
 in status consumption have been limited.
 This seems in part due to unavailability of brand information and detailed
 prices of the supposed status goods in a typical consumption survey.
 But this also due to the peculiar characteristic of a status item which
 on one indicates a rich consumer's exclusive status while on the other
 creates bandwagons for the poorer consumer.
 The returns from status items to the consumer are hardly substituted with
 savings when the demand for status items can always grow for all consumers
 while varying with social contexts seldom captured in a consumption survey.
 In the proposed chapter, employing a particular dataset on ownership of
 long-term assets along side with the consumption diary, we attempt to infer
 the context of status consumption in a developing economy while explaining
 how the demand for non-durable consumption in excess of one's needs - which
 we view as non-durable status consumption - can vary across regions in
 an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Reference groups - definition ] The notion of a reference group for status
 is key to our understanding of the consumer's context as they help pin
 down a certain level of status consumption as the consumer's social need.
 Without this association with a reference group one cannot answer - for
 example - whether the not-so-rich spend disproportionately higher on status
 items in an economy or that the high spending on status goods is limited
 to the rich.
 Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 This is crucial since the consumer's social need for status items is hardly
 as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Model] In the current model, we interpret reference groups as the level
 of asset-ownership in the consumer's immediate environment.
 A consumer who resides in an area where a higher population has more durable
 assets transferable over generations is consider a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

higher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (richer) reference group.
 
\bar under
If the consumer has assets that are higher than this local average, then
 that further improves her status.
 
\bar default
The utility function which the representative consumer optimises consists
 of the non-durable consumption above needs and her position in the asset
 hierarchy (or the reference group) indicated by the long-term assets ownership.
 Thus a per-head consumption budget 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, the representative consumer can either spend on non-durable consumption
 above needs (henceforth referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 or choose a reference position 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 which in the economy-wide asset-hierarchy.
 We assume that the needs of the consumer are predetermined and are tied
 with the number of family units.
 Therefore, after excluding the essential needs of the consumer and the
 cost associated with owning assets (fees, maintenance and repair costs
 relevant for the consumer's owned assets), the choice for the consumer
 is between excess and the richness through her reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Symbols] It is worth highlighting that the above approach does not assume
 a substitution between quantity and quality.
 Instead, the representative consumer pursues quality once after basic needs
 are met.
 Considering a poor family living in Dar-es-salaam with a rich family living
 in Iringa, the two would have different total consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the difference would depend both on the needs of the respective families
 and the local costs of consumption in the area (i.e.
 within a certain geographical area or a certain population mass around
 where the consumers reside i.e.
 Iringa and Dar-es-Salaam).
 Denoting the total budget of the two households as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 we can write 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
c_{t} & =\pi(r_{t})\times\psi_{t}\times\nu_{t}\label{eq:budget_definition}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 represent the needs units of the consumer (e.g.
 number of family members), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the multiplicative quality metric chosen by the consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 the richness of the consumer's reference (surroundings) in the economy-wide
 hierarchy of assets and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 the local costs of consumption imposed by the consumer's surroundings 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 To reiterate, the representative consumer does not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 her needs in the model and the choice she makes is between higher non-durable
 consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 above needs (excess) and her local surroundings 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Higher excess in a lower reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 can thus be substituted with lower excess in a higher (richer) reference.
 The model necessarily assumes a continuum of asset-bands 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well as that of consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 above needs costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}\times\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the representative consumer has the choice to move to a village or live
 in an urban area (or move between rich and poor areas within a locality).
 While in a real-world sceanrio, such a choice is constrained by one's income
 or social class, ours is only an attempt to understand the behaviour of
 the representative consumer if she were to be granted a higher budget 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 We thus formulate the following utility for the consumer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
u(\nu_{t},r_{t}) & =\alpha log(\nu_{t}-\bar{\nu})+(1-\alpha)log(r_{t}-\bar{r})\label{eq:basic_utility}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{r},\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

 are constants.
 From Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we have 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\nu_{t}r_{t}\psi_{t} & =c_{t}\Rightarrow log(\nu_{t})+log(r_{t})+log(\psi_{t})=log(c_{t})
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the per-head consumption in the household 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{c_{t}}{\psi_{t}}\equiv x_{t}$
\end_inset

, the budget can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
log(\nu_{t})+log(r_{t}) & =log(x_{t})\label{eq:budget_logs}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the empirical methods relying on the above model is merely test
 the significance of the substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that the consumption-level average associated with the consumer's
 surroundings represented with the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 depends only on the reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In the data, therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 can be observed directly as the aggregate consumption implied associated
 with the reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, a richer area i.e.
 a richer asset-band (a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

) corresponds to a certain value 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 above which the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is chosen by the consumer.

Excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We classify the consumption items in the LSMS survey under four major categories
 - food, energy, transport and household.
 Instead of of considering all food items as basic needs, we consider the
 variation in food quality across the regions in Tanzania as part of excess.
 As there seems to be ample evidence of a pressure on food-quality in sub-Sahara
n countries, we believe that an attainment of higher food quality would
 be visible enough in the society to be considered as part of excess.
 Further, since only about 10% of Tanzanians avail electricity, the improvement
 of food quality through having a refrigerator is a luxury that cannot be
 considered as basic needs of the consumer.
 In other words, when the needs for food quality are not met for the majority
 of a population, social interactions are likely to separate consumers who
 can afford better food quality from those who can't (see wa-masters).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expenditures on energy and transport are considered costs of maintaining
 a certain level of assets.
 This accommodates the view that while comparing statuses of two consumers
 only one of who owns a motorcycle, we do not need to compare how much petrol
 they've purchased when we've already taken into account their transportation-re
lated assets.
 Therefore, it's only the household category where the non-food expenditure
 is not associated with the assets owned by the consumer.
 The items over which the expenditure is aggregated to arrive at total excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

Durable goods and reference level consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The asset-richness of the neighborhood which the representative consumer
 is set to choose is inferred using the data on stock of durable goods owned
 by every consumer.
 While the durable goods recorded in the LSMS survey range from short-term
 durable items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets
 such as land or houses, we are interested primarily in the long-term asset
 that can be transferred over generations - accumulations that better encompass
 the notion of asset-richness.
 Also, the assets transferred over a generation can be readily verified
 by inspecting households in the data that are split when a young member
 of the unsplit family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of records of asset-ownership in the LSMS dataset include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 the household expects by selling the durable good in the current market
 at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-value in area surrounding the consumer
 - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household) and also because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 reflects the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time as well.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained is simply
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 We do not use the changes in asset value in the panel to avoid measurement
 errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A more appropriate analysis could use the immediate neighborhood of the
 consumer's wards - but not having the geographic location of the ward (or
 the MTAA field in the survey) limits the granularity of our analysis to
 the level the district which a consumer belongs to.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we use the geocoding of the districts where the consumes reside to infer
 the consumer's neighborhood.
 We also consider a population-adjusted neighborhood metric around the neighbour
hood by incorporating the population mass in the consumer's district using
 the 2012 Population and Housing Census (PHC) for Tanzania.
 As the districts with the highest population densities are in the Dar-es-salaam
 and Geita regions, we repeat our analyses with the rural distances standardised
 to the level of Dar-es-salaam districts - effectively aggregating data
 from districts to the same level as that of the district in Dar-es-salaam
 region
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This population-adjusted distance - over which the cluster of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 are aggregated - is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta_{AB}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer in district 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 is the Euclidean distance between coordinates for 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}+N_{B}$
\end_inset

 is population that is meant to reside within the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the distance weighted by the total population in districts 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 which are meant to be in the consumer's vicinity depending on a given threshold.
 This size of the bubble around the consumer that determines her locality
 is therefore the set of districts that are a distance less than the threshold.
 It is evident that the population-adjusted distance shorter for denser
 areas but larger for sparser populations (which are supposed to make consumers
 feel a smaller reference despite being spread over a larger geographical
 area).
 In other words, denser areas simply mean a narrower reference group over
 which 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 are calculated.
 For example, the population-distances would be higher in Arusha (region
 1 in the survey) but far less in Dar-es-salaam (region 7 in the survey).
\end_layout

 The results discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 do not however the results with the population-adjusted-distance as our
 conclusions are not sensitive to the selection of population adjusted distance
 vs the simple Euclidean distance.
 This may be both because of the coarse granularity of our reference boundaries
 (district level) and the wider districts in the rural regions (with only
 a few exceptions such as Sumbawanga and Nkasi in Rukwa which we consider
 within the same reference on grounds of proximity in Euclidean distance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus for a given boundary of reference around every consumer's district,
 the consumer's asset-richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the average market value of assets owned by the consumers within the
 boundary.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 is the average excess consumption (expenditure on items that are either
 classified as excess or food) for consumers within the boundary.
 This necessarily implies that all consumers within a boundary have the
 same 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 while their 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}=\frac{x_{t}}{\pi(r_{t})}$
\end_inset

 varies.
 This mandates that the number of observed households within the reference
 boundary should be high enough to cancel out the idiosyncratic effects
 as well as the issues related to seasonality of data-capture (e.g.
 less electricity needed in winter etc.).
 The alternative measures for consumer's reference neighborhood we try by
 including occupation and education also ensure at least more than 10 households
 in the reference.

 The primary goal of this analysis is only to test whether the consumers

 More specifically, the model parametrises the urban-rural and regional

\end_inset

 and

 - attempting to understand just to what extent the differences in long-term

 (excess).
 It is worth emphasising that consumer diaries cannot tell us whether a
 consumer spends more on non-durable consumption because of a peer-pressure
 she feels or because she is forced to spend higher on non-durable consumption
 across the neighborhoods in an economy.
 This assessment could be made - at least to some extent - with the data
 on subjective well being recorded in the survey.

 The idea that the consumer

 non-nondurable consumption by availing higher quality or quantity than
 necessary does not make sense if we include the costs imposed on the consumer
 due to owning assets (through maintenance, repair, fees etc.).
 The total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 which the consumer scales up and encompasses the social need of being in
 the neighbourhood 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 - must therefore also exclude the cost of maintaining assets.
  In other words, the advantage that the consumer gets from being in an
 asset-rich neighborhood is meant to be measured with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$

 As the consumer scales up the expenditure

 of how much below or above the consumer is to the average 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r)$

 Consider for example, two consumers in a locality with needs

 We attempt to understand the motivations to some extent by inferring how

 If consumption makes people happy we should see that those spending higher
 on quality should be happier than those who don't have high quality (for
 the same given assets).
 We present these results with non-parametric smoothing of the happiness
 measures and comparing them with similar plots for

[Parametric-SubjectiveWellBeing ] We do not assume that happiness is what
 is optimised by the consumer.
 While it may makes descriptive sense to say that there is nothing else
 the consumers would rather optimise - one must also admit that consumption
 surveys may not have enough variables that contribute the consumer's happiness.
 In other words, our approach with consumption surveys is often better positione
d to interpret happiness itself as a need that is constrained with differences
 in income and social status.
 Consumers could indeed believe that being rich would make them happier
 - but we cannot rule out the possibility that the consumers choose to stay
 miserable in order to achieve happiness in the future or happiness for
 their children.
 A household - whose decisions we attempt to understand with our representative
 consumer - makes decision on based on needs under income constraints -
 rather than less understood goals of happiness.

 Our analysis is therefore limited to understanding how happy the consumers
 are after making their consumption choices.
 This effectively compares the model's definition of being miserable (being
 in a poorer reference group or having low excess) with the reported subjective
 well being in the survey.

Non-parametric view
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most pervasive observation from the LSMS data for Tanzania is the disparity
 in income/occupations between the east-coast and the rest of the country.
 The occupations associated with higher income are far fewer in the hinterland
 than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 To explore the effect of this disparity on status consumption in more detail
 we examine the variation in excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 with respect to occupation/education levels and distribution of long-term
 assets in the economy.
 In this analysis, the occupation levels are measured using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ranks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 derived from the income-data in the survey by mapping the occupation levels
 to values (ranks) ranging from 0 to 3 (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:occupation_rank"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:education_rank"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 These mappings are also used to vary the reference boundaries to include
 only those with the same occupation/education rank as oneself (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ParametricRegressions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We believe that the relative poverty in the rural areas of Tanzania and
 high population density in the central and eastern Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PopulationDistribution2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) provides a particular context to status differences in the economy and
 that the disparity in services as well as amenities across the country
 is bound to have strong implications for any consumption deemed status-related.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status concerns are necessarily localised, one would expect that the
 non-durable consumption for consumers in the asset poor south and west
 are much lower.
 But the extreme poverty in the southern regions means the food prices are
 not so much lower despite lower incomes in the region (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodPrices2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a comparison of food-prices
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The food basket comprises of the cheapest item in carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables sub-categories.
 The minimum recommended quantities for the household are multiplied with
 the available market prices in the survey.
 For most regions (districts), the basket consists of recommended per-head
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 So while the poor consumer in the south may not need a lot to differentiate
 herself from others in her reference group, the extreme poverty fails to
 make her indifferent between being poor in the densely populated regions
 in the east and being slightly more asset-rich in poor south.
 The regional differences clearly dominate the local hierarchies in this
 context.
 This happens both due to food prices being comparable with the eastern
 region and the possibilities/amenities available to the urban residents
 that are unimaginable in the remote south.
 The excess non-durable consumption in the south can provide a utility comparabl
e to that in the eastern coast.
 On the other hand, we see that despite lower incomes in the central north,
 the median net-asset worth of the individuals in regions such as Singida
 and Manyara (region around -5S,36E) could match up with that of the consumers
 in the east coast of Tanzania (-6S,40E) (see the differences in occupation
 ranks 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.).
 This is largely due to insufficient coverage of the income surveys and
 significant informal sectors in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 With the average asset-values and food prices relatively more aligned the
 central and east regions , the occupational differences are more important
 between the two regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To inspect the differences non-durable consumption across regions in Tanzania
 in more detail, we provide local regression (loess) estimates which smoothen
 the plotted values in the household's surroundings (i.e.
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 coordinates of the resident's district).
 The excess non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the unit log local asset i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu_{t}}{r_{t}}$
\end_inset

 is plotted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the assets-worth of the individual household 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 for year 2012 are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:log_assets_2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The loess plots and the distribution of assets also suggest a relatively
 high non-durable consumption in the central region.
 Therefore a consumer could be indifferent to living in a poor neighborhood
 in the Dar-es-Salaam and being slightly richer in the Singida.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To verify that the variations in the non-durable consumption are not solely
 due to higher food prices, we compare the food and non-food expenditures
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodNonFood_x"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 These plots do not suggest that food expenditures are the primary driver
 for variation in non-durable consumption between east-coast and central
 regions.
 The differences in consumption (durable and non-durable) indicate overall
 poverty in the south (-10S,36E) as well as far north regions (-3S,32E)
 and the relatively higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}/r_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the less densely populated central Tanzania (see the population distribution
 for Tanzania in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PopulationDistribution2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The variation of non-durable consumption in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is thus characterised by higher expenditure relative to asset-richness
 (measure by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu_{t}}{r_{t}}$
\end_inset

 ) in the south/far-north (due in part to low levels of asset ownership
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) and slightly higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the central north regions (-8S,36E) as well as the eastern coast (-4S,40E).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is associated with higher satisfaction or not can be verified using the
 data on subjective well-being in the survey.
 If for the same level of assets, the consumers with higher excess register
 higher satisfaction than those with less excess, then we can infer that
 a higher excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 makes the consumer happier.
 Since the converse does not hold i.e.
 happier consumers need not have higher excess, the subjective perception
 data may only be used to test whether the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 makes consumers happier or not.
 A consumer may in fact be miserable as she raises expenses on relative
 non-durable consumption to satisfy status requirements as a social need.
 Since our model for consumption only considers what is revealed from consumer
 expenditures and since consumer perceptions are not priced in any markets,
 we are prevented from putting consumer perceptions under economic constraints
 and use revealed preference methods to attribute consumer contentment to
 a particular type of consumption (e.g.
 excess).
 We can however still test whether consumers of different expenditures (e.g.
 the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

) gain different perceptions across the economy.
 The consumer perceptions of life do include the consumer's perception of
 status and are also localised just like status is.
 The test whether consumers are more content with higher excess (for the
 same assets) is thus feasible without the claim that consumers make consumption
 choices to optimise subjective well-being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
In the loess results in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SubjectiveWellBeing2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it may seem at first
\bar default
 that a positive (negative) outlook of the future is related to having higher
 assets.
 This seems evident when one looks at the eastern regions that have much
 higher perceptions overall (see area around -8S, 40E in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SubjectiveWellBeing2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, the poorer regions do not have the poorest perceptions - since
 the regions in the centre seem to stand out in their negative perceptions
 (see area around -4S,34E).
 These regions in the centre (around -4S,34E) have both low non-durable
 consumption per head per unit-asset 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}/r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and relatively low assets.
 The perceptions in the asset poor southern regions is relatively higher
 (see -10S,40E) confirming that perceptions of quality of life are local
 concerns - neither asset poverty nor high food prices may influence the
 subjective perceptions of the quality of life for the consumer.
 Given the high perception of life in the eastern regions (despite perceptions
 for housing and relative richness being much worse e.g.
 around - 2S,40E), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 does seem to have some role to play in the denser urban areas.
 This may be largely due influence yielded by the urban amenities - including
 better variety in food (which in turn seems to be assisted with the availabilit
y of electricity and refrigeration).
 It does seem that poverty does not influence happiness in Tanzania - an
 observation that doesn't contradict the possibility that the poor are not
 the same status comparisons as the rich.

Recall that the model in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 defines 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 as a measure of deviation from the average per-head non-durable consumption
 in the consumer's locality.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

is the average asset value averages in the locality.
 In the results shown in Tables 
\begin_inset ERT

 and

 is represented by

 and the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})-r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is represented as

\family default
\size default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

 being the total value of assets accumulated by the households).
 Further, the factor variables 
\family typewriter

max_occupation_rank
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
max_education_rank 
\family default
\size default
are the maximum occupation and education ranks in the household respectively
 (see Table

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
We notice that over the entirety of Tanzania, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the consumers with more assets have overall higher food and non-food expenditur
es even after excluding the asset-driven costs.
 This seem to be a typical consumption profile where accumulation of more
 assets corresponds to lifestyle changes requiring higher non-durable consumptio
n.
 Given the extreme disparities noted in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Nonparametric"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 however, it is worth comparing the effects of disparities in assets, income
 and amenities on consumption using a parametric approach based on the model
 from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 rises with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 overall, one expects that the average of observed 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 in the consumer's neighbourhood would also increase with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Extreme regional disparities mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 varies significantly across regions (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LoessPi_r2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) - the net effect of the regional disparities and local disparities in
 incomes is that the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 at local levels is more sensitive to differences in occupation levels whereas
 regional disparities overweigh at higher (coarser) levels in the economy.
 We verify the observation by inspecting different quantiles of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and by varying the notion of asset-localities to consider consumers close
 to one's own occupational/educational level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the results from quantile regression of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the dependent variable shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessQuantile}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we find that the education ranks 2 and 3 are associated with lower excess
 quantiles (see 
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
 results).
 More specifically, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for education rank 2 is in lowest quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
) and that for education rank 3 is in medium quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
).
 The highly educated have less excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in high quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q90
\family default
\size default
) but high excess in low quantiles.
 Unlike education levels, the occupational differences have a more significant
 influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - which is consistently high for those with high-earning occupations and
 low for those in the poorer occupations.
 This holds for all quantiles - regardless of whether one is in a disadvantaged
 or a rich region or whether one has relative local asset advantage or not,
 the effects of occupation on lifestyle are significant.
 This tell us that the relative advantage from having a higher income occupation
 is not limited to the Dar-es-salaam (which is where excess is the highest).
 Noting that the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
\size small
Ar
\family default
\size default
) is higher than that of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
\size small
r
\family default
\size default
) in both 
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
, we infer that the local richness drives up the lifestyle costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for most consumers - even if taken as a whole the average consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 does rise with average assets 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The income differences dominate at the local level for excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 but regional disparities are more important than occupational differences
 at the coarser level.
 The significant negative coefficients for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\family typewriter
\size small
r
\family default
\size default
 ) at high quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q90
\family default
\size default
) suggest that highest spenders of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 are limited to a few regions (i.e.
 Dar-es-Salaam Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This is verified with the loess plot in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodNonFood_x"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as well.
 Loosely speaking, one could say that the consumption is of the bandwagon
 type at local levels - but has snob-like characteristics at coarser levels.
 We also presented the variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 against 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 as a linear estimation in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessLinear}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Similarly to the observations from the quantile regression, the relative
 significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
\size small
r
\family default
\size default
) over the personal wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (
\family typewriter
\size small
Ar
\family default
\size default
) dominates when taken over the entirety of Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also examine 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 by choosing narrower reference groups based on the occupation levels or
 education levels - i.e.
 by calculating average expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 by taking expenditure only from consumers who have the same level of occupation
 or education as oneself.
 Again, since better occupations and higher education level should increase
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 (average consumption of those with same occupation/education) and decrease
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

, one would expect a sharper rise in the expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 rises with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is narrowed to one's own occupation and education level.
 But takes as a whole the narrower references do not seem to have more economic
 significance than the regional differences.
 Therefore, while occupation and education do influence relative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 within consumer localities, the effect of occupation-level on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not strong over the entirety of the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the above analysis of urban and rural disparities may appear to ignore
 any differences between the consumer's agricultural and industrial assets,
 the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 does consider the effect of urban and rural differences due to urban and
 rural disparities in wealth.
 Thus, if a consumer gains more status by owning a luxury car in the city
 than owning a tractor (which cost the same) in a village, our approach
 might not differentiate between the vehicle being a tractor or a luxury
 car but does considers the asset in a rich area (city) and the poor area
 (village).
 The measures of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 depending only on their reported prices alone (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

) therefore suffices for our analysis.

\begin_layout Section*
APPENDIX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For simplicity of notation, we replace 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}\rightarrow r$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}\rightarrow x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}\rightarrow r$
\end_inset

 in the following expressions.
 The utility function is therefore
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
L=u(\nu,r)-\lambda(log(x)-log(r)-log(\nu))\\
L=\alpha log(\nu-\bar{\nu})+(1-\alpha)log(r-\bar{r})-\lambda(log(x)-log(r)-log(\nu))
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the first order conditions,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial L}{\partial\nu}=0\Rightarrow\frac{\alpha}{1-\bar{\nu}/\nu}=-\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial L}{\partial r}=0\Rightarrow\frac{1-\alpha}{1-\bar{r}/r}=-\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\because1/r=\nu/x$
\end_inset

 we have the quadratic equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha}{1-\bar{\nu}/\nu}=\frac{1-\alpha}{1-\nu\bar{r}/x}\Rightarrow\frac{\nu}{\alpha}-\frac{\bar{\nu}}{\alpha}=\frac{\nu}{1-\alpha}-\frac{\nu^{2}\bar{r}}{(1-\alpha)x}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\bar{r}}{(1-\alpha)x}\nu^{2}+(\frac{1}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{1-\alpha})\nu-\frac{\bar{\nu}}{\alpha}=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha}{(1-\alpha)}(r-\bar{r})\pi'(r)=\pi(r)-\frac{\pi(r)^{2}\bar{\nu}}{x}$
\end_inset

 is a Bernoulli Equation.
 Rewriting it as the following, we can use the definition 
\begin_inset Formula $g(r)=\frac{1}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\pi'(r) & =\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha(r-\bar{r})}\pi(r)+(-\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r-\bar{r})})\pi(r)^{2}\label{eq:simple_form_pi_r}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition 
\begin_inset Formula $g(r)=\frac{1}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

 leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $g'(r)=\frac{-\pi'(r)}{\pi(r)^{2}}$
\end_inset

 and allows us to simplify the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:simple_form_pi_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{\pi'(r)}{\pi(r)^{2}}=-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha(r-\bar{r})}\frac{1}{\pi(r)}+\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r-\bar{r})}$
\end_inset

 so that the following is a linear differential equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
g'(r) & =-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha(r-\bar{r})}g(r)+\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r-\bar{r})}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $a(r)\equiv-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha(r-\bar{r})}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b(r)=\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r-\bar{r})}$
\end_inset

.
 We know that for 
\begin_inset Formula $g'(r)=a(r)g(r)+b(r)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(r_{0})=g_{0}$
\end_inset

the initial value problem has the following solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
g(r) & =g_{0}e^{A(r)}+e^{A(r)}\int_{r_{0}}^{r}e^{-A(s)}b(s)ds\label{eq:general_solution}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $A(r)=\int_{r_{0}}^{r}a(s)ds$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A(r)=(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha})log(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})$
\end_inset

 and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
e^{A(r)} & =(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}(r-\bar{r})^{-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{0}}^{r}e^{-A(s)}b(s)ds=\int_{r_{0}}^{r}\{(\frac{s-\bar{r}}{r_{0}-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(s-\bar{r})}\}ds=\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}\int_{r_{0}}^{r}(s-\bar{r})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}-2}ds$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\ne\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, we have the following solution (for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 the integrand is a constant).
 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{0}}^{r}e^{-A(s)}b(s)ds=\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}\times\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\alpha}-1}\{(s-\bar{r})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}-1}|_{r_{0}}^{r}\}=\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}\{(r-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}-(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\int_{r_{0}}^{r}e^{-A(s)}b(s)ds & =\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x}((\frac{r-\bar{r}}{r_{0}-\bar{r}}){}^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}-1)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
g(r) & =\frac{1}{\pi(r_{0})}(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}+(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\times\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x}((\frac{r-\bar{r}}{r_{0}-\bar{r}}){}^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}-1)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
g(r)=\frac{1}{\pi(r)} & =(\frac{1}{\pi(r_{0})}-\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x})(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}+\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(r)=\frac{1}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\pi(r) & =\frac{x(r-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}{(\frac{x}{\pi(r_{0})}-\bar{\nu})(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}+(r-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\bar{\nu}}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests using higher powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in the regression.
 Notice also that the above permits 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\alpha}-1>1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\alpha}-1<1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu^{*}=\frac{x}{\pi(r^{*})}=xg(r)$
\end_inset

 or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\nu^{*}= & (\frac{x}{\pi(r_{0})}-\bar{\nu})(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}+\bar{\nu}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\nu^{*}$
\end_inset

grows linearly with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and non-linearly with 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 We thus consider the regression as an estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\nu^{*}}{\partial x}$
\end_inset

 where a non-linear formulation is used.
