\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
While status consumption is assumed to be ubiquitous, the possibility that
 extreme wealth inequalities in an economy could discourage status comparisons
 across groups separated by income has been explored less often.
 Focusing on the particular context of a developing economy where income
 differences can be extreme, we consider status consumption as non-durable
 consumption in excess of the consumer needs relative to her wealth band
 and explore the opposing effects of peer influences and extreme wealth
 differences.
 With consumption and subjective well-being data from Tanzania, we discuss
 how separation of status concerns based on extreme wealth differences and
 heterogeneity of amenities may characterise status consumption in a developing
 economy.

Research Question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that those without higher non-durable consumption have less status
 than those with higher assets, do consumers end up substituting expenditure
 on non-durable consumption with owning long-term assets in income disparities?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does income disparity bring?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does conspicuous consumption bring?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary goal of this analysis is only to test whether the consumers
 in richer references use less relative quality (and vice versa) or not.
 Is the appeal for status consumption merely an appeal for urbanisation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We avoid the typical classification.

\begin_layout Standard
[Fundamental Needs are the same for the rich] We use the view of status
 as a context driven utility from consumption and wealth to argue also that
 the richer consumers do not have fundamentally different needs - but context-dr
iven costs of status indication.
 The reference dependent status consumption implies that there exists universal
 need of status consumption - but not that the fundamental needs themselves
 are higher for a richer consumer.
 For example, a rich neighborhood having high prices of food does not mean
 that the needs for food are costlier for the richer consumer (if that was
 true, an arbitrageur would take advantage to offer cheaper prices for food
 with the difference in prices for food explained accounted only by costs
 of transportation).
 If we can admit that consumers optimise life-style choices and goals higher
 than nutrition, then the higher costs on food are likely to be be intertwined
 with long-term choices of the consumer (which force her to be a neighborhood
 with higher food prices).
 More expenses on fundamental needs might be a consequence of availing higher
 status - rather than having different needs per se (this is explained by
 Maliath as non-transactional optimisations).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the intertemporal substitution framework has been widely used in consumer
 economics, its applications in status consumption have been limited.
 Partly this is due to unavailability of information on brand variety and
 of detailed prices of the supposed status goods.
 But this also appears to be due to the peculiar characteristic of a status
 item wherein it both indicates a rich consumer's exclusive status and creates
 bandwagons for the poorer consumer.
 The returns from status items to the consumer can be hardly substituted
 with savings when the demand for status items can always grow for all consumers
 as they acquire more assets.
 The intertemporal approach is rather impractical unless one is able to
 track the varying social contexts of the consumers as they acquire more
 assets.
 In the proposed chapter, we use a particular dataset on ownership of long-term
 assets along side with the consumption diary to infer the context of status
 consumption in a developing economy.
 Using the model we develop based on the argument that status can be modified
 through consumption only through durable goods and a local relative advantage
 in non-durable consumption, we examine how the demand for non-durable consumpti
on in excess of one's needs can vary across regions in an economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of a status reference group is key to our understanding of the
 consumer's context in status-related consumption as it helps us pin down
 a certain level of status consumption as the consumer's social need.
 Further, it allows us to answer whether the not-so-rich spend disproportionatel
y higher on status items in an economy or that the high spending on status
 goods is limited to the rich.
 Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 Since the consumer's social need for status items is hardly as universal
 as it is for essential food or clothing, reference groups become a critical
 notion in our view of status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the proposed model, we interpret reference groups as the level of asset-owner
ship in the consumer's immediate environment.
 A consumer who resides in an area where a higher population has more durable
 assets transferable over generations is considered a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

higher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (richer) reference group.
 The utility function which the representative consumer optimises consists
 of the non-durable consumption above needs and the richness of her reference
 group (defined with long-term assets ownership in the consumer's locality).
 Thus given a per-head consumption budget 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, the representative household can either spend on non-durable consumption
 above needs (henceforth referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 or choose a reference position 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the economy-wide asset-hierarchy.
 We assume that the needs of the consumer are predetermined and are tied
 with the number of family units.
 Therefore, after excluding the essential needs of the consumer and the
 cost associated with owning assets (fees, maintenance and repair costs
 relevant for the consumer's owned assets), the choice for the consumer
 is between excess and the richness through her reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the above approach does not assume a substitution
 between quantity and quality.
 Instead, the representative consumer pursues quality once after basic needs
 are met.
 The consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 would depend both on the needs of the respective families and the local
 costs of consumption in the area
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
c_{t} & =\pi(r_{t})\times\psi_{t}\times\nu_{t}\label{eq:budget_definition}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 represent the needs units of the consumer (e.g.
 number of family members), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a multiplicative quality metric chosen by the consumer, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 the richness of the consumer's reference (surroundings) in the economy-wide
 hierarchy of assets and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 the local costs of consumption imposed by the consumer's surroundings 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 To reiterate, the representative consumer does not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 her needs in the model and the only choice she makes is between higher
 non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 above needs (excess) and her local surroundings 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Higher excess in a lower reference 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 can thus be substituted with lower excess by the representative consumer
 in a higher (richer) reference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model necessarily assumes a continuum of asset-bands 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well as that of consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 above needs costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t}\cdot\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the representative consumer exercises the choice to move
 to a village or live in an urban area or move between rich and poor areas
 within a locality likewise.
 While in a real-world scenario, such a choice is constrained by one's income
 or social class, the supposed behaviour of the representative consumer
 under a granted budget 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 is only to empirically test the significance of substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The following loglinear utility models this substitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
u(\nu_{t},r_{t}) & =\alpha log(\nu_{t}-\bar{\nu})+(1-\alpha)log(r_{t}-\bar{r})\label{eq:basic_utility}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{r},\bar{\nu}$
\end_inset

 are constants.
 From Equation

\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the per-head consumption in the household 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{c_{t}}{\psi_{t}}\equiv x_{t}$
\end_inset

, the budget can be rewritten as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
log(\nu_{t})+log(r_{t}) & =log(x_{t})\label{eq:budget_logs}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption-level average associated with the consumer's surroundings
 represented with the function

.
 We observe 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 directly as the aggregate consumption implied associated with the reference

\end_inset

 In other words, a richer area i.e.
 a richer asset-band (a higher

\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$

Excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption items in the LSMS survey are classified under four broad
 categories - food, energy, transport and household.
 Given the ample evidence for pressures on food-quality in sub-Saharan countries
 (see for example Schneider et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MastersMalawiFoodQuality2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), we believe that an attainment of higher food quality would be visible
 enough in the society and consider it as part of excess.
 Further, since only about 10% of Tanzanians avail electricity, the improvement
 of food quality through having a refrigerator is a luxury that cannot be
 considered as basic needs of the consumer.
 In other words, when the needs for food quality are not met for the majority
 of a population, social interactions are likely to separate consumers who
 can afford better food quality from those who can't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expenditures on energy and transport are treated as costs of maintaining
 a certain level of assets.
 The idea behind this treatment of energy and transport related cost is
 that while comparing statuses of two consumers of which only one owns a
 motorcycle, we do not need to compare how much petrol they've purchased
 when we've already taken into account the difference in their transportation-re
lated assets.
 Since energy and transport related assets are already considered as part
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer, we exclude costs associated with energy and transport
 from the notion of excess non-durable consumption.
 Therefore, it's only the household category where the non-food expenditure
 is not associated with the assets owned by the consumer.
 The items over which the expenditure is aggregated to arrive at total excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 are listed in Table

Durable goods and reference level consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The asset-richness of the neighborhood which the representative consumer
 is set to choose is inferred using the data on stock of durable goods owned
 by every consumer.
 The durable goods recorded in the LSMS survey range from short-term durable
 items such as mobile phones to the expensive and long-term assets such
 as land or houses.
 Of these, we are interested only in the long-term assets that can be transferre
d over generations - accumulations that encompass the notion of asset-richness.
 The assets transferred over a generation are readily verified by inspecting
 households in the data that are split when a young member of the unsplit
 family starts a new household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of the records of asset-ownership in the LSMS data include the
 number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 of durable goods owned by the household, the reported cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 at which the durable good was purchased and the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 which the household expects by selling the durable good in the current
 market at the time of survey.
 We use the reported price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 of the durable goods to infer the asset-value in area surrounding the consumer
 - partly because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not susceptible to errors associated with recall of the purchase value
 (which often varies for the same item over years in the panel data for
 a household) and because 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

 encapsulates the perceived depreciation of the durable good over time as
 well.
 The total cost of the assets of a household is thus obtained is simply
 a product of the number of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}$
\end_inset

 reported by the consumer with the price 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing this chapter, the precise geographic-location of
 every household (or the ward she belongs) to is not available to us from
 the LSMS data.
 As a result, we have relied only on the geocoding of districts where the
 consumes reside in order to define the consumer's neighborhood
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A more appropriate analysis could use the immediate neighborhood of the
 consumer's wards - but not having the geographic location of the ward (or
 the MTAA field in the survey) limits the granularity of our analysis to
 the district's level.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We also consider a population-adjusted neighborhood metric around the consumer
 household by incorporating the population mass in the consumer's district
 from the 2012 Population and Housing Census (PHC) data for Tanzania.
 Since the districts with the highest population densities are in the Dar-es-sal
aam and Geita regions, we repeat our analyses with the rural distances standardi
sed to the level of Dar-es-salaam districts - effectively aggregating data
 from districts to the same level as that of the district in Dar-es-salaam
 region
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This population-adjusted distance - over which the cluster of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 are aggregated - is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta_{AB}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}$
\end_inset

 for the consumer in district 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 is the Euclidean distance between coordinates for 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}+N_{B}$
\end_inset

 is population that is meant to reside within the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{AB}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the distance weighted by the total population in districts 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 which are meant to be in the consumer's vicinity depending on a given threshold.
 The bubble around the consumer that determines her locality comprises of
 districts that are at a distance less than the given threshold.
 It is evident that the population-adjusted distance is shorter for denser
 areas but larger for sparser populations (which represent an effectively
 smaller reference for consumers' in the bubble despite being spread over
 a larger geographical area).
 In other words, denser areas imply a narrower reference group over which
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 are calculated.
 For example, the population-distances would be higher in Arusha (region
 1 in the survey) but far less in Dar-es-salaam (region 7 in the survey).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The results discussed in the Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 do not however show significantly different results from the Euclidean
 distance approach .
 This is likely because of the coarse granularity of our reference boundaries
 (district level) or the district boundaries already being wider in the
 rural regions (with only a few exceptions such as Sumbawanga and Nkasi
 in Rukwa which we consider within the same reference on grounds of proximity
 in Euclidean distance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the consumer's asset-richness 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the average market value of assets owned by the consumers within the
 boundary of reference around the consumer (including the district which
 the consumer belongs to) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 is the average excess consumption i.e.
 the expenditure on items that classified as excess or food in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 for the consumers within the reference boundary.
 All consumers within the reference necessarily have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 while their 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}=\frac{x_{t}}{\pi(r_{t})}$
\end_inset

 as well as the individual asset-worth 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 varies.
 A constraint that this aggregation imposes is that the number of observed
 households within the reference boundary should be high enough to average
 out the idiosyncratic effects and issues related to seasonality of data-capture
 (e.g.
 less electricity needed in winter etc.).
 At the time of writing this chapter, we've made sure no districts with
 less than 10 observations per year are included in our analyses.

The primary goal of the analysis is to test whether the consumers in richer
 references use less relatively quality (and vice versa) or not
\series default
.
 The costs of lifestyle in a particular region that we measure with 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 does not include the cost of owning and maintaining assets from 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 already includes the contribution of assets to one's status.
 In the words, since a consumer does not choose the maintenance of assets
 separately from owning the asset, the idea that a representative consumer
 may 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scales-up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 her per-head non-nondurable consumption with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 by availing a higher quality or quantity than necessary makes sense only
 if we exclude the costs imposed on the consumer due to owning assets (through
 maintenance, repair, fees etc.) from the per-head consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 which the consumer scales up and encompasses the social need of being in
 the neighbourhood 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 therefore exclude the cost of maintaining assets.
  Similarly, the advantage that the consumer gets from being in an asset-rich
 neighborhood is meant to be measured with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - with a possible substitution between the two.
 As the consumer scales up the expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})\cdot\psi_{t}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for higher utility (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:budget_definition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 does not include asset purchases or asset costs but merely the indication
 of how much below or above the consumer is to the average 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r)$
\end_inset

 imposed by her locality 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 For example, with two consumers in a locality who have needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1},\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 and consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}\equiv\frac{c_{1}}{\psi_{1}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}\equiv\frac{c_{2}}{\psi_{2}}$
\end_inset

 we choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r)=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\frac{x_{1}}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}=\frac{x_{2}}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}\pi(r)+\nu_{2}\pi(r)=x_{1}+x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that consumer diaries are not meant to tell us
 much about whether a consumer spends more on non-durable consumption because
 of a perception of a certain external social need or because of a desire
 to stand out from others in her reference.
 This assessment could be made - only to some extent - using the data on
 subjective well being that is recorded in the survey.
 More specifically, the LSMS survey records the responses from subjective
 well-being questionnaire related to the consumer's financial, health, housing
 and overall satisfaction levels for every year.
 To assess whether excess consumption improves one's perception or not,
 we use compare these satisfaction against the asset distribution and regional
 differences in Tanzania.
 This is presented as non-parametric regression plots for financial, housing
 and overall contentment in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal is to find test whether for the same total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, those with less assets feel dissatisfied while also having higher excess
 levels or not (and likewise if, extremely satisfied consumers in the higher
 asset band have less excess or not).
 If consumption makes people happy we should see that those spending higher
 on quality should be happier than those who don't have high quality (for
 the same given assets).
 We present these results with non-parametric smoothing of the happiness
 measures and comparing them with similar plots for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 (which depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

) and asset-bands 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this analysis, we are careful not to assume that a positive perception
 is what is optimised by the consumer.
 While it may makes descriptive sense to say that there is nothing else
 the consumers would rather optimise - our model for consumption does not
 identify the variables that would influence her happiness.
 So while the consumers are likely to believe that being rich would make
 them happier, we cannot rule out the possibility that the consumers may
 choose to stay miserable in the short-run to achieve future happiness or
 happiness for the progeny.
 An approach with consumption surveys is thus better positioned to interpret
 happiness itself as a need constrained with budget constraints, occupational
 differences and asset-richness rather.
 In view of our model, the consumer contentment only captures what consumer
 feels after having exercised her choice rather that what motivates her
 choice.

Non-parametric view

\begin_layout Standard
The most pervasive observation from the LSMS data for Tanzania is the disparity
 in income/occupations between the east-coast and the rest of the country.
 The occupations associated with higher income are far fewer in the hinterland
 than in the east coast of Tanzania (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 To explore the effect of this disparity on status consumption in more detail
 we examine the variation in excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 with respect to occupation/education levels and distribution of long-term
 assets in the economy.
 In this analysis, the occupation levels are measured using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ranks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 derived from the income-data in the survey by mapping the occupation levels
 to values (ranks) ranging from 0 to 3 (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:occupation_rank"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Education levels are similarly mapped to education ranks (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:education_rank"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 These mappings are also used to vary the reference boundaries to include
 only those with the same occupation/education rank as oneself (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ParametricRegressions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We believe that the relative poverty in the rural areas of Tanzania and
 high population density in the central and eastern Tanzania (see Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PopulationDistribution2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) provides a particular context to status differences in the economy and
 that the disparity in services as well as amenities across the country
 is bound to have strong implications for any consumption deemed status-related.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since status concerns are necessarily localised, one would expect that the
 non-durable consumption for consumers in the asset poor south and west
 are much lower.
 But the extreme poverty in the southern regions means the food prices are
 not so much lower despite lower incomes in the region (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodPrices2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a comparison of food-prices
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The food basket comprises of the cheapest item in carbohydrates, fat, protein
 and fruits-vegetables sub-categories.
 The minimum recommended quantities for the household are multiplied with
 the available market prices in the survey.
 For most regions (districts), the basket consists of recommended per-head
 diet of cassava, cooking-oil, eggs and bananas.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 So while the poor consumer in the south may not need a lot to differentiate
 herself from others in her reference group, the extreme poverty fails to
 make her indifferent between being poor in the densely populated regions
 in the east and being slightly more asset-rich in poor south.
 The regional differences clearly dominate the local hierarchies in this
 context.
 This happens both due to food prices being comparable with the eastern
 region and the possibilities/amenities available to the urban residents
 that are unimaginable in the remote south.
 The excess non-durable consumption in the south can provide a utility comparabl
e to that in the eastern coast.
 On the other hand, we see that despite lower incomes in the central north,
 the median net-asset worth of the individuals in regions such as Singida
 and Manyara (region around -5S,36E) could match up with that of the consumers
 in the east coast of Tanzania (-6S,40E) (see the differences in occupation
 ranks 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, empirical studies often use the data
 on occupation or education to proxy the income differences (see Alesina
 et al.).
 This is largely due to insufficient coverage of the income surveys and
 significant informal sectors in the economies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:occupations_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 With the average asset-values and food prices relatively more aligned the
 central and east regions , the occupational differences are more important
 between the two regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To inspect the differences non-durable consumption across regions in Tanzania
 in more detail, we provide local regression (loess) estimates which smoothen
 the plotted values in the household's surroundings (i.e.
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 coordinates of the resident's district).
 The excess non-durable consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the unit log local asset i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu_{t}}{r_{t}}$
\end_inset

 is plotted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the assets-worth of the individual household 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 for year 2012 are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:log_assets_2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The loess plots and the distribution of assets also suggest a relatively
 high non-durable consumption in the central region.
 Therefore a consumer could be indifferent to living in a poor neighborhood
 in the Dar-es-Salaam and being slightly richer in the Singida.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To verify that the variations in the non-durable consumption are not solely
 due to higher food prices, we compare the food and non-food expenditures
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodNonFood_x"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 These plots do not suggest that food expenditures are the primary driver
 for variation in non-durable consumption between east-coast and central
 regions.
 The differences in consumption (durable and non-durable) indicate overall
 poverty in the south (-10S,36E) as well as far north regions (-3S,32E)
 and the relatively higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}/r_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the less densely populated central Tanzania (see the population distribution
 for Tanzania in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PopulationDistribution2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The variation of non-durable consumption in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is thus characterised by higher expenditure relative to asset-richness
 (measure by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\nu_{t}}{r_{t}}$
\end_inset

 ) in the south/far-north (due in part to low levels of asset ownership
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 ) and slightly higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the central north regions (-8S,36E) as well as the eastern coast (-4S,40E).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is associated with higher satisfaction or not can be verified using the
 data on subjective well-being in the survey.
 More specifically, if for the same level of assets, the consumers with
 higher excess register higher satisfaction than those with less excess,
 we can infer that a higher excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 makes the consumer happier.
 Since the converse does not hold i.e.
 happier consumers need not have higher excess, the subjective perception
 data may only be used to test whether the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 makes consumers happier or not and eventually how perceptions vary with
 excess and assets.
 Since status is a social need, a consumer could even be miserable as she
 raises expenses on relative non-durable consumption to satisfy status requireme
nts.
 Further, since we don't value consumer perceptions in a market and consider
 only what is revealed from consumer expenditures, we are prevented from
 viewing consumer perceptions under economic constraints and using revealed
 preference methods to attribute consumer contentment to a particular type
 of consumption (e.g.
 excess).
 We can however use the subjective well-being data to test whether consumers
 of different expenditures (e.g.
 the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

) gain different perceptions across the economy.
 The consumer perceptions of her present circumstances do include her perception
 of status and are also localised the way status is.
 The test whether consumers are more content with higher excess (for the
 same assets) is thus feasible without the claim that consumers make consumption
 choices to optimise subjective well-being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the loess results in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SubjectiveWellBeing2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, a rudimentary view may suggest that a positive (negative) outlook of the
 future is related to having higher assets.
 This seems particular true for eastern regions which have much higher perceptio
ns as well as high value of assets (see area around -8S, 40E in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SubjectiveWellBeing2012"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, it is noticeable that the poorer regions do not have the poorest
 perceptions - as the regions in the centre stand out in their negative
 perceptions (see area around -4S,34E).
 These regions in the centre (around -4S,34E) have both low non-durable
 consumption per head per unit-asset 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}/r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and relatively low assets.
 The perceptions in the asset poor southern regions is relatively higher
 (see -10S,40E) - confirming that the perceptions of quality of life are
 local concerns.
 Neither asset poverty nor high food prices seem influence the subjective
 perceptions of the quality of life for the consumer in southern areas.
 The relatively low non-durable consumption in areas with low perception
 also suggests a role of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in consumer perception.
 The high subjective perception of life in the eastern regions (despite
 perceptions for housing and relative richness being much worse e.g.
 around - 2S,40E), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 has a role to play in the denser urban areas as well.
 This seems due to the influence yielded by the urban amenities - including
 better variety in food (which in turn seems to be assisted with the availabilit
y of electricity and refrigeration).
 In summary, poverty does not influence happiness in Tanzania - but without
 getting in the way of the possibility that the poor may not in the same
 status competition as the rich.

Recall that the model in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 defines 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 as a measure of deviation from the average per-head non-durable consumption
 in the consumer's locality.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

is the average asset value averages in the locality.
 In the results shown in Tables

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$

 is represented by

 and the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})-r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is represented as 
\family typewriter
\size small
Ar
\family default
\size default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 being the total value of assets accumulated by the households).
 Further, the factor variables 
\family typewriter
\size small
max_occupation_rank
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
max_education_rank 
\family default
\size default
are the maximum occupation and education ranks in the household respectively
 (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:occupation_rank"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the entirety of Tanzania, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the consumers with more assets have overall higher food and non-food expenditur
es even after excluding the asset-driven costs.
 This isn't atypical since lifestyle changes usually require higher non-durable
 consumption as consumers accumulate more assets.
 However, given the disparities in the economy we have noted in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Nonparametric"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it is worth refining the observation with net effects of disparities in
 assets, occupation and amenities on consumption with a parametric approach.
 Here we find some evidence of substitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 While it is evident from the variation in the average of observed 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 with the asset average 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 in the consumer's neighbourhood ( see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:log_pi_r_with_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 ) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 should rise with 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$

, the extreme regional disparities also imply that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 varies significantly across regions (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LoessPi_r2012"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 The net effect of the regional disparities and local disparities in incomes
 is so that the excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 at local levels is more sensitive to differences in occupation levels whereas
 regional disparities overweigh at higher (coarser) levels in the economy.
 We verify this observation by inspecting different quantiles of excess
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 and by varying the notion of asset-localities to consider consumers close
 to one's own occupational/educational level.

In the results from quantile regression of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the dependent variable shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tabExcessQuantile}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we find that the education ranks 2 and 3 are associated with lower excess
 quantiles (see 
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
 results).
 More specifically, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for education rank 2 is in lowest quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
) and that for education rank 3 is in medium quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
).
 The highly educated have less excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 in high quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q90
\family default
\size default
) but high excess in low quantiles.
 Unlike education levels, the occupational differences have a more significant
 influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 - which is consistently high for those with high-earning occupations and
 low for those in the poorer occupations.
 This holds for all quantiles - regardless of whether one is in a disadvantaged
 or a rich region or whether one has a relative local asset advantage or
 not, the effects of occupation on lifestyle are significant.
 This tell us that the relative advantage from having a higher income occupation
 is not limited to the Dar-es-salaam (which is where excess is the highest).
 Noting that the economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
\size small
Ar
\family default
\size default
) is higher than that of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 
\family typewriter
\size small
r
\family default
\size default
) in both 
\family typewriter
\size small
q30
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
q60
\family default
\size default
, we infer that the local richness drives up the lifestyle costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 for most consumers - even if taken as a whole the average consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 does rise with average assets 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The income differences dominate at the local level for excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 but regional disparities are more important than occupational differences
 at the coarser level.
 The significant negative coefficients for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\family typewriter
\size small
r
\family default
\size default
 ) at high quantiles (
\family typewriter
\size small
q90
\family default
\size default
) suggest that highest spenders of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 are limited to a few regions (i.e.
 Dar-es-Salaam Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:loess_nu_per_r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This is verified with the loess plot in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FoodNonFood_x"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as well.
 Loosely speaking, one could say that the consumption is of the bandwagon
 type at local levels - but has snob-like characteristics at coarser levels.
 The variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 against 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 is also shown with a linear estimation in Table

 Similar to the observations from the quantile regression, the relative
 significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 (

) over the personal wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $log(A_{t})$
\end_inset

 (

) dominates when taken over the entirety of Tanzania.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also examine 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 by choosing narrower reference groups based on the occupation levels or
 education levels - i.e.
 by calculating average expenditures 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 by taking expenditure only from consumers who have the same level of occupation
 or education as oneself.
 Since better occupations and higher education level should increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 (average consumption of those with same occupation/education) and decrease
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

, one would expect a sharper rise in the expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(r_{t})$
\end_inset

 rises with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 is narrowed to one's own occupation and education level.
 But taken as a whole, the narrower references do not seem to have more
 economic significance than the regional differences.
 Therefore, while occupation and education do influence relative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 within consumer localities, the effect of occupation-level on 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not strong over the entirety of the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that while the above analysis of urban and rural disparities may
 appear to ignore any differences between the consumer's agricultural and
 industrial assets, the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 does consider the effect of urban and rural differences due to urban and
 rural disparities in wealth.
 Thus, if a consumer gains more status by owning a luxury car in the city
 than owning a tractor (which cost the same) in a village, our approach
 might not differentiate between the vehicle being a tractor or a luxury
 car but does considers the asset in a rich area (city) and the poor area
 (village).
 The measures of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 depending only on their reported prices alone (see Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Standard
We started our analysis with the need to account for wide differences.
 We asked if the appeal for status consumption merely an appeal for urbanisation.
 Using the non-parametric smoothening and quantile approaches, we find some
 evidence of substitution between having higher assets and relative advantages
 in non-durable consumption wider levels.
 The consumers in asset-richer areas have less inequalities among themselves
 in terms of non-durable consumption.
 It seems that the urbanisation does show high non-durable consumption despite
 higher assets.
 There is thus evidence for both disparities in urban amenties across the
 country and some separation of status competitions as the role of asset-poverty
 does not seem to influence subjective perceptions of well-being.
 The substitution with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

 is thus significant overall but within regions poorer and richer there
 is not much subsitution between 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Status consumption is different under income differences.
 By localising the context and arguing that status can be modified through
 consumption only through durable assets and relative non-durable differences,
 the model shows how consumers subjected to extreme differences in amentiies
 and asset but yet avail non-durable consumption to address local social
 needs which constitute status.

APPENDIX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For simplicity of notation, we replace 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}\rightarrow r$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}\rightarrow x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{t}\rightarrow r$
\end_inset

 in the following expressions.
 The utility function is therefore
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
L=u(\nu,r)-\lambda(log(x)-log(r)-log(\nu))\\
L=\alpha log(\nu-\bar{\nu})+(1-\alpha)log(r-\bar{r})-\lambda(log(x)-log(r)-log(\nu))
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the first order conditions,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial L}{\partial\nu}=0\Rightarrow\frac{\alpha}{1-\bar{\nu}/\nu}=-\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial L}{\partial r}=0\Rightarrow\frac{1-\alpha}{1-\bar{r}/r}=-\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\because1/r=\nu/x$
\end_inset

 we have the quadratic equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha}{1-\bar{\nu}/\nu}=\frac{1-\alpha}{1-\nu\bar{r}/x}\Rightarrow\frac{\nu}{\alpha}-\frac{\bar{\nu}}{\alpha}=\frac{\nu}{1-\alpha}-\frac{\nu^{2}\bar{r}}{(1-\alpha)x}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\bar{r}}{(1-\alpha)x}\nu^{2}+(\frac{1}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{1-\alpha})\nu-\frac{\bar{\nu}}{\alpha}=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha}{(1-\alpha)}(r-\bar{r})\pi'(r)=\pi(r)-\frac{\pi(r)^{2}\bar{\nu}}{x}$
\end_inset

 is a Bernoulli Equation.
 Rewriting it as the following, we can use the definition 
\begin_inset Formula $g(r)=\frac{1}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\pi'(r) & =\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha(r-\bar{r})}\pi(r)+(-\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r-\bar{r})})\pi(r)^{2}\label{eq:simple_form_pi_r}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition 
\begin_inset Formula $g(r)=\frac{1}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

 leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $g'(r)=\frac{-\pi'(r)}{\pi(r)^{2}}$
\end_inset

 and allows us to simplify the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{\pi'(r)}{\pi(r)^{2}}=-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha(r-\bar{r})}\frac{1}{\pi(r)}+\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r-\bar{r})}$
\end_inset

 so that the following is a linear differential equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
g'(r) & =-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha(r-\bar{r})}g(r)+\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r-\bar{r})}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $a(r)\equiv-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha(r-\bar{r})}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b(r)=\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r-\bar{r})}$
\end_inset

.
 We know that for 
\begin_inset Formula $g'(r)=a(r)g(r)+b(r)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(r_{0})=g_{0}$
\end_inset

the initial value problem has the following solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
g(r) & =g_{0}e^{A(r)}+e^{A(r)}\int_{r_{0}}^{r}e^{-A(s)}b(s)ds\label{eq:general_solution}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $A(r)=\int_{r_{0}}^{r}a(s)ds$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A(r)=(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha})log(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})$
\end_inset

 and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
e^{A(r)} & =(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}(r-\bar{r})^{-\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{0}}^{r}e^{-A(s)}b(s)ds=\int_{r_{0}}^{r}\{(\frac{s-\bar{r}}{r_{0}-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(s-\bar{r})}\}ds=\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}\int_{r_{0}}^{r}(s-\bar{r})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}-2}ds$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\ne\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, we have the following solution (for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 the integrand is a constant).
 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{0}}^{r}e^{-A(s)}b(s)ds=\frac{(1-\alpha)\bar{\nu}}{x\alpha(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}\times\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\alpha}-1}\{(s-\bar{r})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}-1}|_{r_{0}}^{r}\}=\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}\{(r-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}-(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\int_{r_{0}}^{r}e^{-A(s)}b(s)ds & =\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x}((\frac{r-\bar{r}}{r_{0}-\bar{r}}){}^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}-1)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
g(r) & =\frac{1}{\pi(r_{0})}(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}+(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\times\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x}((\frac{r-\bar{r}}{r_{0}-\bar{r}}){}^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}-1)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
g(r)=\frac{1}{\pi(r)} & =(\frac{1}{\pi(r_{0})}-\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x})(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}+\frac{\bar{\nu}}{x}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(r)=\frac{1}{\pi(r)}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\pi(r) & =\frac{x(r-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}{(\frac{x}{\pi(r_{0})}-\bar{\nu})(r_{0}-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}+(r-\bar{r})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\bar{\nu}}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests using higher powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in the regression.
 Notice also that the above permits 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\alpha}-1>1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\alpha}-1<1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu^{*}=\frac{x}{\pi(r^{*})}=xg(r)$
\end_inset

 or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\nu^{*}= & (\frac{x}{\pi(r_{0})}-\bar{\nu})(\frac{r_{0}-\bar{r}}{r-\bar{r}})^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}+\bar{\nu}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\nu^{*}$
\end_inset

grows linearly with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and non-linearly with 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 We thus consider the regression as an estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\nu^{*}}{\partial x}$
\end_inset

 where a non-linear formulation is used.
