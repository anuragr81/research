\begin_layout Standard
[Equilibrium] It is an equilibrium also of asset bands - where consumption
 leads to a certain place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Why care about separation] We care about separation only because it's relevant
 how status consumption are structured - more competitions at the local
 levels means less immigration pressures and availability of goods.
 More globalisation would mean more development and perception of a wider
 entity.
 Whether these are important or not is of importance to how status consumption
 is viewed in the developing countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An obvious limitation of the excess approach is that it does not differentiate
 between an excess in food items from an excess in clothes.
 There is no difference - in terms of excess 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 - between a rural overspending on a wedding ceremony and the urban spending
 on cable TV subscriptions while in an itemwise analysis these would be
 considered explicitly.
 We favour the excess approach as it solves two keys issues with the measurement
 errors.
 First is the lack of observed prices for clothing or entertainment in the
 survey data.
 We avoid using a unit price of clothing by observing expenditure on clothing
 at local levels (see Gibson et al[#GibsonKimQualityBog2019] for measurement
 errors with this approach) to measure elasticities excess, and limit ourselves
 to testing whether excesses are separated across levels of asset-ownership
 hierarchies or not.
 The second issue is the mixing of daily-diary and monthly diary - which
 we avoid by separating the needs from quality.
 Notice also that any fixed-effects in the excess budget are removed through
 econometric methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Happiness data] One thing that's reassuring with our measure of excess
 is that indicates those who are unsatisified have proportionately higher
 excess.
 Extremely unsatisifed person don't have high excess.
 Extremely satisfied consumers tend to have less excess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Entertainment is not a need] The base level of need is subject to debate.
 One can argue that within an economy, for example, that transportation
 is a need in the urban area while it isn't in a rural area.
 This hardly poses an issue with the excess approach since an urban consumer
 who has the the same total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as a rural consumer,would have a less excess due to higher transportation
 expenditure.
 However, if other needs such as entertainment - which we consider as part
 of excess - are considered more necessary in the urban area than the rural
 area (thus resulting in different 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

) may be at odds with our view of excess.
 
\bar under
While it is true that an urban consumer having the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as the rural consumer may “feel” that her entertainment needs are higher
 due to peer effects, it cannot be ascertained from the consumption data
 alone whether the consumers move to urban areas to achieve a higher status
 or that the residents of the urban areas feel more pressures which represent
 a higher entertainment need (we attempt to use subjective well-being data
 to derive some conclusions).
 
\bar default
Now if we had considered entertainment as (higher) part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

, an urban consumer could balance the utility from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (the trait of being urban) with having less excess than the rural consumer
 (higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 results in less excess for same expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 By sticking to a definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 as only costs associated with assets, we consider role of peer effects
 by letting the asset ownership proxy the environment of the two consumers.
 More particularly, since the urban areas are always richer on the whole
 than rural areas, price
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 are bound to be different from the urban and rural consumer ( a higher
 price would ceteris paribus result in a higher excess).
 To compare two consumer having the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, we must therefore also consider their 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which determines 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 relevant for the consumer (which is is dependent on the environment defined
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

).
 Let's assume that the cost of basic needs 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the same for the two consumer and the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{urban}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{rural}$
\end_inset

are negligible.
 Now if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{urban}<A_{rural}$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $x-\Psi(A_{rural})-\delta<x-\Psi(A_{urban})-\delta$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the excess budget of the urban consumer is higher and the rural consumer's
 relative position is higher than that of urban consumer (since the higher
 number of rich residents in the urban area).
 Separation is therefore ruled out - particularly if the rural consumer
 also faces a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

 than the urban consumer .
 Similarly, when 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{urban}>A_{rural}$
\end_inset

the excess budget of the rural consumer is higher (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A_{urban})>\Psi(A_{rural})\Rightarrow x-\Psi(A_{urban})-\delta<x-\Psi(A_{rural})-\delta$
\end_inset

) and the urban consumer may or may not have a higher relative position
 than the rural consumer.
 A separation condition is avoided only if the rural consumer has a lower
 cost 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

 than the urban consumer.
 The lifestyle differences in the rural area and the urban area are thus
 represented with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band dependent excess prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of saying that the need for entertainment is higher in the urban
 area, we argue only to that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 in the urban area could create a separation from the rural area.
 The shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 is inferred from the costs observed in the consumption diary as costs associate
d with assets whereas the notion of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band which are associated with
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

are observed by using 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\rho}A$
\end_inset

 at relevant hierarchies.

 For this discussion consider that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 defines the entire 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

-band so that the consumers in the band

 As 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

 is not directly observed, we 're only interested in using it to test if
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{nu}$
\end_inset

 is excesses are segmented by wealth hierarhcies or not.
 If we a continuous function 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

 could be assumed then a weaker economic significance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would imply a weak 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-based separation.
 Likewise, significant differences in excesses based on 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 -ownership would imply a strong separation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that separation is merely a condition where competitions with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 are ruled out due to differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 This can result due to extreme differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 or
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 We consider two representative consumers in the successive bands 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A+\Delta A$
\end_inset

 to see how 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 would cause separation.
 First, we consider extreme differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which cause separation by segmenting the status goods across 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A+\Delta A$
\end_inset

) and allowing the differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 dominate the comparisons between consumers from band 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A+\Delta A$
\end_inset

.
 Next we consider how 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 differences could cause a separation.
 Here, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 didn't change across successive bands 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A+\Delta A$
\end_inset

 for the two consumers from the respective bands who also have the same
 total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A)=\Psi(A+\Delta A)$
\end_inset

 then a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A+\Delta A)$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $A+\Delta A$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A+dA)>P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

 prevents a separation since 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x-\Psi(A)-\delta}{P_{\nu}(A+dA)}<\frac{x-\Psi(A)-\delta}{P_{\nu}(A)}$
\end_inset

 and the indifference 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{x-\Psi(A)-\delta}{P_{\nu}(A)},A)=u(\frac{x-\Psi(A)-\delta}{P_{\nu}(A+\Delta A)},A+\Delta A)$
\end_inset

 could be possible.
 In other words, the consumers could exchange places with each other if
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A+\Delta A)>P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

.
 Conversely, if we find a substitution in the successive bands i.e.
 consumers reducing the excesses (facing the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 across the band) as they move to the band

 we could dismiss a separation.
 Likewise, if
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A+dA)<P_{\nu}(A)$
\end_inset

 , we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x-\Psi(A)-\delta}{P_{\nu}(A+dA)}>\frac{x-\Psi(A)-\delta}{P_{\nu}(A)}$
\end_inset

 and a separation is necessitated which we would observe as a lack of substituti
on in data i.e.
 consumers increasing excess as they move to the higher band.
 Finally 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 for certain 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands (e.g.
 with utilities that are only available within the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-band) could also create separation conditions.
 Assuming that we have 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\nu}(A)=P_{\nu}(A+\Delta A)$
\end_inset

 for successive bands, separation is ensured when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(A+dA)<\Psi(A)$
\end_inset

 - as 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\frac{x-\Psi(A)-\delta}{P_{\nu}(A)},A)=u(\frac{x-\Psi(A+dA)-\delta}{P_{\nu}(A+dA)},A+dA)$
\end_inset

 is ruled out (note that separation is also trivially implied when 
\begin_inset Formula $x<\Psi(A+dA)+\delta$
\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard
[Econometric test for separation] What separation means in the data is simply
 the substitution of excesses between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bands.
 If there is no separation across identified bands 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 , one would observe that for a significant number of consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\nu,A)=u(\nu',A')$
\end_inset

 for the same 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 In the cost-function function this would correspond to the consumers in
 the bands 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 paying the same outlay 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,P_{\nu}(A))$
\end_inset

 as they face different prices in the respective

\begin_layout Standard
In a regression with excess budget ratio
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\nu}$

as the dependent variable, therefore, a lack of separation would amount
 to a weak significance of the difference

 between the bands.

 also indicate how significant the condition of separation might be - a
 higher in a richer

\end_inset

-band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For whether local peer effects are more important to the consumer than the
 wider-level wealth differences or not, we compare the dependence of excesses
 on local asset-difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 vs national asset-differences 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

or not (respectively).
 If excesses depend weakly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

 but strongly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

, this means that status consumption is limited to the local region and
 the region is relatively separated from other regions.

\bar under
 Thus local peer effects are more dominant than differences in wealth at
 wider levels when .
 
\bar default
This could happen either if the consumer  resides in a relatively rich region
 or a relatively poor region.
 On the other hand, if we find a weak significance on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{nat}$
\end_inset

 but a stronger dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{local}$
\end_inset

, then local separation exists and the rich consumer may be competing at
 a wider (national) level.
 In it is possible that there is weak significance across both hierarchies
 (implying that excesses are not particularly separated at either levels)
 or that there is strong dependence across both hierarchies (the consumers
 have their excesses within the limits the position in the local hierarchies
 and are then also separated by regional wealth at the wider level).
