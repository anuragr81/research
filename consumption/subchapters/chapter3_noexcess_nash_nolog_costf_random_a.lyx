\begin_layout Title
Status competitions under extreme income differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
While status-driven consumption and the appeal for social mobility through
 consumption appear to have become more prominent in recent decades, relative
 income differences have remained as permanent as differences in long-term
 wealth.
 We explain how the social promise offered by status consumption may be
 constrained by finite economic growth in an economy - which we view as
 comprising of disparate income bands that the consumers transition through
 while gaining social mobility.
 Viewing status consumption as intertemporal choice to invest towards the
 probabilistic social mobility in long-term, we explore the implications
 of contentment with one's one income bands due to social or cultural barriers
 for social mobility in the economy.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%Compared to Oxoby,  has a direct role and is based on subjective lack of
 knowledge of the world.
 It is only through competitions that consumer form their identity and would
 make fairly random decisions before.
 Therefore they would put  thinking they have a fair chance of being a winner.
 That the long-term equilibrium does not allow that does not matter - since
 the consumers think it does not affect them.
 Unlike in Oxoby, a poor decision affects them monetarily if they make a
 bad decision (what does their fixed-horizon equilibrium imply) and they
 don't really get any non-monetary utility.
 Like Cole-Maliath - they get only monetary benefit.
 Status is implied only through the assets somebody acquires - a view that
 is fundamentally dependent on  (see Kornienko).
 The idea that consumers compensate for not having status is strictly represente
d as risk-taking consumers compensate by taking unlikely risks.
 The consumer gets utility from her own relative wealth as well.
 The band-membership represents the non-transactional advantages of consumers
 - that do affect the consumer's wealth - albeit indirectly.
 The poor want to associated with the rich by status consumption because
 it provides a certain promise of gaining non-transactionally.
 The rich want not to be associated with the poor because they fear that
 they may be disadvantaged.
 Our model is different from Cole Maliath in two fundamental ways - first
 we consider the long-term implications of the equilibrium - second we utility
 association with asset-accumulation.
 Income distributions matter in Cole-Maliath (and Korenienko).
 We look at huge significant differences in income distribution caused by
 regional or social barriers.
 We believe that this cannot be understood without a probability formulation
 - because utility from matching does involve consideration of probability.
 Desire for status is about aligning oneself with this probability - while
 simultanesouly choosing higher assets.
 We also allow - with a simpler formulation - for societies to differ in
 the degrees of their rat races.
 The raison d'etre of disposable income bands are the really long-term effects
 which consumers accept but have no control over (non-transactional aspects)[als
o see Krupka-Weber].

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
On one hand, status goods are those that indicate a consumer's exclusive
 status while on the other, they create bandwagons for those with low status.
 To understand this universal race to exclusivity, status consumption has
 often been associated with the consumer's reference group.
 When all consumers are set to benefit from higher status consumption, reference
 groups help pin down a certain level of status consumption as the consumers'
 social need.
 They clarify empirically whether a given status item is more valuable to
 those who already have higher status or to those who don't (e.g.
 by asking which reference groups the consumers in comparison may belong
 to).
 Lastly, the association helps answer whether the not-so-rich spend disproportio
nately higher on status items in an economy or that the high spending on
 status goods is limited to the rich.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 This is particularly important since the consumer's social need for status
 items is hardly as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.
 With social needs determined by the consumer's interaction with others
 in the economy, the demand for status items necessarily depends on social
 participation and exclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-transactional environments of consumer choice and the uncertainty
 inherent in perception of status have been explored in the literature on
 status consumption - most particularly by Cole-Maliath
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"

\end_inset

 and Hopkins-Kornienko

\end_inset

.
 In the proposed chapter, we rely on the framework to explore consumer choice
 under extreme income inequalities that may develop due to geographic, occupatio
nal or social differences.
 We take an approach similar to Cole-Maliath
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in assuming that consumer does not obtain utility directly from the reference
 but through variables in her utility that are shaped by her reference.
 We focus in particular on the uncertainty arising out of non-transactional
 choices that contribute to the consumer's future expectations from status
 competitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of our argument is that if status goods - such as jewelry or a
 club membership - offered status utility that is not any more uncertain
 than the purchase from savings of the expensive long-term assets such as
 a house or a private jet, the representative consumer would know of the
 futility of status consumption (compared to saving towards higher wealth).
 The substitution between saving and consumption in the intertemporal substituti
on framework is therefore not suitable for understanding status consumption
 unless one considers either i) that the consumer's utility is subject to
 the risk implied by status consumption or ii) that the status items offer
 a utility different from the one that is derived from regular goods.
 While the latter option of splitting utility into visible and non-visible
 terms has its advantages, we find that the distinctions between items that
 provide status utility and those that provide regular utility may be more
 difficult to justify under environments of extreme income inequalities
 (e.g.
 in developing economies where relative wealth is more easily visible).
 This motivates the proposed approach to viewing status consumption as the
 consumer's risky position in an intertemporal framework.

\end_inset

 - who explore status competitions for a given distribution of success-determini
ng attributes in a population of consumers - we consider the inequality
 in rewards different from inequality in incomes in a specific instance
 of persistent (long-term) income inequalities.
 With near-permanent income inequalities, the consumer's hope to overcome
 the persistent inequality coincides with the promise of status competitions
 where status consumption is rewarded.
 In an approach similar to Cole-Maliath
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 , we use a finite set of income bands so that the transition probabilities
 among them determine the future wealth states of the consumer and her expectati
ons towards the future.
 The basic needs of the consumer are supposed to be already met in this
 economy so that the only option the consumer faces is to either save towards
 future assets or spend her income above needs towards status consumption.
 A fundamental assumption for the transition probability is that it encompasses
 all possible paths which a consumer could follow to rise in the hierarchy
 of income bands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model we develop, the utility from the consumer's future wealth consists
 both of the current value of assets and the probability of being in the
 same or different income-bands in the future.
 We assume that the probabilities that define the transition to successive
 income bands are the same for all consumers within an income band.
 Further, the consumers are meant to discover their success only through
 performance in the status competitions.
 Over time, the preferences as well as the success-determining attributes
 of the consumers remain unchanged as they transition across income bands.
 We also consider the implications of long-term inequalities on the equilibria
 assuming that the population of consumers in the income bands does not
 change over time.
 While the processes of accumulation and inheritance ensure that the assets
 acquired by consumers in various income bands do grow apart over time,
 they also imply a certain mobility through status competitions for all
 participants in order to assist fairness and stability among the income
 bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the status of the consumer is encompassed
 solely by the assets she would amass in a probable future.
 Therefore, the status comparisons are based not on the total assets at
 a time but the expected assets within a certain time-horizon.
 By means of an example, consider a classical musician who may be perceived
 to have a higher status than a country musician even though the latter
 has amassed a higher fortune.
 While all consumers are meant to maximise their assets acquisitions, a
 higher status can be associated to the classical musician in the model
 since it is the expected wealth over a finite time horizon that represents
 status (the rich consumers also bear a possibility of decline).
 The comparison between the two musicians depends foremost on whether they
 are in the same income band or not.
 When they are in the same income band, they participate in the same status
 competitions and the classical musician could - while relying on sublimity
 of her music and a sophistication curated over centuries - be more prepared
 for being in a higher income-band.
 Similarly, when the classical musician belongs to the poorer income band,
 the possibility that the poorer musician may have higher status is not
 completely ruled out either (when the classical consumer is in a richer
 band, her higher status is trivially implied).
 Even though being in a poorer income band implies that most classical musicians
 have a lower status than most country musicians (the listeners having a
 higher preference for classical musicians cannot result in lower income
 for classical musicians over time), the higher attribution of status for
 a poorer classical musician is possible if for example there is a popular
 association of decadence with the riches and thus a lower future expectation
 of wealth (in a finite time horizon).
 This notion of status similar to the status-is-wealth equilibria described
 by Cole-Maliath

  with a transition in income bands, we also account for the poorer consumer
 having a propensity to remain within her income band due to the localised
 notions of status.
 This is permitted by letting the consumer with lower assets in a poorer
 band have a higher utility than she would for the same level of assets
 in a richer band.
 In the proposed formulation of status under extreme income differences
 with stable band populations, we find that status consumption are intensified
 as the income inequalities rise in an economy.

Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of our model is to look at how the demand for status consumption
 changes under an environment of disparate clusters of disposable income.
 The consumer identity to these distinct bands implies different disposable
 incomes to the consumer.
 This is equivalent to the more commonly used assumption of wealth growing
 at a constant growth rate - where a similar clustering of wealth would
 imply immense variation in interest income across bands.
 The separation of consumers among income bands means that being in the
 band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 provides disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in a given period to the consumer.
 The choice which the consumer faces is to either save to gain the utility
 from assets staying in their income band or spend a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 out of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to participate in a status competition which would promote her to a higher
 income band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the income bands range from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in an economy, the promotion of a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to the next income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 is provided with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the highest band 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer could also be demoted to an immediate lower income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the lowest band 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected utility from the future assets in the respective
 income bands she may be in the future.
 The incomes are distinguished based solely upon rewards of status competitions
 i.e.
 the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1...n}$
\end_inset

 that are provided in the respective income band (the disposable income
 excludes the cost of a consumer's needs and is the same for all consumers
 in a particular asset-band).
 We summarise the assumption as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:def_band"

\end_inset

The incomes bands are characterised only by the levels of disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final goal of every consumer in the model is to have the highest assets
 in the economy.
 Since the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every band can be used to accumulate towards assets or participate in
 tournaments of unobserved ability, the wealth differences among consumers
 in this economy arise either due to differences in starting assets or due
 to performance in status competitions.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the status competitions are provided structurally by the social institutions
 to grant some mobility across income bands while not completely getting
 rid of the stratification that prevents more participation.
 A success in status competitions serves both as an evidence of ability
 and as a barrier to entry for those with less proven abilities.
 The ability pertinent to one's status may be innate, unobserved and responsible
 for success in the status competitions, but it is relevant only through
 probabilistic monetary success in the long-term and is revealed to the
 consumer only through status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As chance favours the prepared, more status consumption increases the probabilit
y of one's successes in the status competitions through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and decreases that of failure 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is defined so that a consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is rewarded more often and so that no amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can ever provide guarantee to be in the next band (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 are assumed to have the same structure across income bands (
\begin_inset Formula $\forall k$
\end_inset

) except due to thresholds relevant for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in every income-band.
 In other words, the outlier performers in every band would be dispersed
 with the same distribution in the long-term equilibrium while the consumers
 would maintain different levels of status consumption in every band to
 have a chance to be promoted to the higher band.
 A lower band (e.g.
 a poorer underlcass in an economy or a poorer country in the global economy)
 may thus have a lower base-consumption (e.g.
 mean) on status goods (or cheaper status goods) but the outperformers in
 a poor environment are expected to improve their fortunes through the same
 mechanism that a consumer in a higher-income band (or in a richer country)
 would.
 This is a fundamental assumption for the status competitions in the model
 that determines the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:natural_competition"

\end_inset

The mechanism for the competitions are fundamentally the same across all
 bands except for differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

-reference levels pertaining to each band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in Section in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, the consumers of varying characteristics (age, skills, talent etc.) observe
 the same likelihood of promotion to the next band as long as they are in
 the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 - so that 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 offer exactly the same probability to all the consumers in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Further, since the status competitions in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 to be promoted to band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are not open to any consumers in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that is lower than the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

, it follows that for a consumer to be in a band higher than the next she
 must go through the next band.
 We thus state the following implication of the above assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

A consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can reach to another band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 only by going through bands 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1,...,j-1$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The Corollary 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 implies a Markovian property for the consumer's future utility from assets.
 Status is the expected future utility at any point that the consumers optimise
 with the income received in their income band by either staying in the
 same band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or having moved to any of the bands different from their own.

\begin_layout Standard
[Income differences don't influence the consumer] Notice that the consumers
 are not affected by income differences using above this approach.
 She is concerned only with the long-term asset in the horizon.
 More income helps but so does contentment with lower assets in a lower
 band.
 Since higher income implies higher assets, the presence of mobility as
 well as some status consumption (depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is necessary for her to get to the next band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Properties of a Short-term Equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above set up for status competitions implies a short-term Nash equilibrium
 as consumers optimise total accumulated assets subject to their band-reference
 in a given period.
 The simplest instance of this short-term optimisation is one where the
 consumers in an economy comprising of a poor band 1 and a rich band 2 optimise
 the assets accumulated in a single period.
 In other words, the representative consumer in the two-bands economy has
 just one life and a one shot-investment to make towards her life-time status.
 We also consider that the consumer receives a higher utility from the same
 value of assets when she is in a poorer band compared to when she is in
 a richer band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the consumers optimise savings at the end of the first-time horizon,
 we do not expect them to spend on status consumption at the end of their
 lives.
 This very idea that the consumers optimise value at a finite-time horizon
 means that the state - poorer or richer - after the finite horizon is not
 of no concern to the consumer.
 This holds for also for when higher number of periods (i.e.
 greater than 1) are considered.
 The consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the last period is thus always zero for all the consumers regardless
 of how much wealth they have amassed.

 With higher assets to start with, the consumers are expected to be less
 worried about asset loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above short-term equilibrium expects that the narrowing of income reduce
 status consumption as well as the risk with future assets.
 Since there are limits to how much savings alone can improve the consumer's
 wealth, taking more risk through status consumption is hardly a waste for
 the consumer in the model.
 The risk through status competitions in fact works to reduce asset inequality.
 Whether improving savings (i.e.
 increase 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 alone) - which does not spur status consumption - counters the effects
 of intrinsic income inequalities in the long-term or not is not certain
 due to the finite-horizon over which we have considered the equilibrium.
 To understand the long-term implications of the above model, now consider
 the long-term choice of the consumer in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:Long-term-equilibrium"
plural "false"
caps "false"

.
 As we further elaborate, the conditions for a long-term equilibrium with
 income-inequalities present a significant constraint to the above set up
 and require additional condition for long-term stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most serious problem with our intepretations from the short-term equilibrium
 is that it can only assume

 When 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$

 change across the across the section or over time, the games would also
 change.
 We therefore look towards long-term equilibrium conditions.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to incorporate the implications of persistent long-term inequalities
 in the model, we consider first what a long-term equilibrium with stable
 populations of consumers in the income bands would mean for status competitions.
 To understand the implications of both long-term inequalities and status
 competitions, consider first that without any status consumption, the disparate
 disposable incomes across two bands cannot provide a stable long-term equilibri
um due to the ever-growing gaps in accumulated wealth.
 More specifically, the accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=\sum_{t}^{T}\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the disposable income for the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}=y_{i}\forall t$
\end_inset

 ) would lead to unstable differences in accumulated wealth across bands
 over time.
 This is no different from the assumption of stable growth of assets where
 too the different starting assets would imply disparate interest-incomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could thus say that the presence of status competitions might allow
 the income inequalities to prevail.
 If the preferences for all consumers are the same, an equilibrium may be
 implied in an economy with different bands of disposable incomes if the
 consumers can move across bands often enough.
 Since long-term inequalities in income are persistent through the long-term
 equilibrium, the status competitions which the consumers participate in
 must be population-preserving in the sense that in the long-run the number
 of consumers who leave an income band must be balanced by those who enter
 the income band.
 An equilibrium with long-term income inequalities cannot exist if not for
 such a population preserving status competition.
 We thus observe the status competitions within such a population preserving
 mechanism - equivalent to a scheme where an equal number of consumers are
 selected in successive bands and swapped with each other at a certain cost
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:WinnersandlosersChainExchange"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The presence of status consumption implies that the richer band would spend
 proportionately higher on status competitions and the long-term equilibrium
 would sustain income inequalities across the bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the above swapping mechanism, if 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 represents the probability of a consumer moving from band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 (not defined for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=n$
\end_inset

 in an economy of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 bands) and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k+1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 represents the consumer transition from band 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 ( not defined 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the lowest band), then the population constrain means that 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)=L_{k+1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The asset accumulations of the consumers would necessarily spread around
 if the consumers were randomly selected to be swapped with same probability
 between each pair income bands.
 The swap mechanism implied the the balance of probabilities- 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)=L_{k+1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 so that the same number of consumers are exchanged between successive income
 bands - is essential for the stability of populations of income bands.
 Since assets are carried over every consumer with the swap, the selection
 of winners and losers does move the wealth around to some extent.
 As long as all consumers eventually get a fair chance to participate in
 the exchange, a stable equilibrium would allow assets to spread around
 consumers in different bands.
 This is because the consumers would be wary of giving up more by losing
 their current band when they move up the income bands and care less about
 losing their current band as they won't risk being shunned in the lowest
 bands

 The past success itself is the only relevant determinant of success and
 the consumer identity in the model.
 The essential argument using this approach is that in real-world circumstances,
 such as occupational or marriage markets, the consumers know about their
 abilities only through participation (through expenditures in education

 determine their future decisions of

There are however two issues that must also be considered.
 First, the status competitions may never be

 for the exchange.
 In real world example, status competitions are characterised by how they
 favour those with higher expenditure within a band.
 With all else being the same, higher education expenditure or club memberships
 in a life-time does have a higher likelihood of social mobility.
 Second, whether a probability distribution might exist for such an exchange
 to have a stable distribution of assets that also sustain income inequalities
 is less clear.

 equilibria in more detail.

For the long-term income bands to exist with a stable wealth differences,
 the assets must face some risk.
 We introduce this with a stochastic variable which resets the future assets
 at an expected finite time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 .
 Before describing these long-term dynamics in more details, we prove that
 unbounded asset accumulations cannot achieve a long-term equilibrium under
 a population stability conditions.
 To motivate this proof, consider a general cost-function associated with
 the assets so that the consumers in the long-term equilibrium balance future
 expected income with the costs imposed by the current assets.
 In empirical terms, this may summarise the expected expenditure required
 to maintain a certain level of wealth - including any maintenance fees,
 interest on loan, club memberships etc.
 associated with a certain level of wealth.
 A general cost-function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(A)$

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{2}$

 Note that even though the consumer is allowed to leverage herself by choosing
 costs higher than she can afford, the liquidity concerns would ensure that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}<y_{1}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}<\nu_{2}$

\begin_layout Proof
The above condition implies that the consumer balances her expected future
 income with the costs on her wealth state.
 The net asset value from being either in band 1 or band 2 would be balanced
 by the expected returns the consumer 1 gets from putting up 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 towards status consumption.
 Since the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 must be positive and less than unity, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{2})}{\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{1}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}+y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 must be less than zero.
 In other words, the consumer in band 1 must move from a negative net asset-valu
e to a positive asset value in band 2 (or vice versa).
 Similarly, for the consumer in band 2, the following quantity must amount
 to zero in the long-term equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{2}(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2})\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{1})+(1-L_{2}(\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}))\pi(\prescript{t}{}A_{2}-\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}+y_{2}) & \rightarrow0

\begin_layout Proof
As long as status competition is feasible for consumer 1, she should see
 an increase in the long-term net asset value by being in band 2.
 The possibility of moving from band 1 to band 2 only to observe the net
 asset value decline is ruled out because higher income bands are also meant
 to have a higher asset reference.
 Any peer effects associated with the assets (or a higher reference level
 for assets) would ensure a higher asset reference in the higher asset-band.
 Thus while the consumer in band 1 cannot afford to have a decline in net
 asset value if she moves to the next band, the consumer in the rich band
 might accept a poorer band with a net increase in asset value.
 This implies that the the net asset-value function must be concave (see

 Further, since the choice at t=1 is different from choice at t=0 if considering

  The total assets which we consider are different in the current assets

% [fixing

 on status consumption - because there is some difference in asset still.

 high 
\backslash
omega or ii) a higher

 Again magnitude of

 a discreteness in competition i.e.
 whether the consumer below a certain threshold get no benefit at all.
 We do however see curvature effect on

\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\omega}$

 This could mean pushing status consumption upwards for the poorer consumer
 and downwards for the richer consumer.
 Raising income difference too much makes the status conssumption useless

 Similarly, widening of the income differences

 Whether the overall status consumption in the economy increases or decreases

% HK: a more affluent society will have lower utility at each income level.
 Hence, an increase in average income may be consistent with a decrease
 in social welfare.
 More plausibly, social welfare may rise only slowly in response to economic
 growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% HK: poor are made worse off by greater equality.
 Such an increase in equality will also increase conspicuous  waste by those
 on middle incomes or low and middle incomes, while conspicuous consumption
 by the rich may decrease (our finding too).
 consequently, when we consider corrective taxes on conspicuous consumption,
 we find that the more equally income is distributed, the higher taxes and
 subsidies should be for those with low to middle incomes, and the lower
 they should be  or those with high incomes.
 Indeed, we are able to show that in some circumstances a corrective policy
 with higher tax rates (but also higher subsidies) for those with low incomes
 can lead to a Pareto improvement

In the conventional approach of the intertemporal substitution, we would
 argue that there is an observed rate of growth of assets which the consumer
 - but this interest rate is a huge assumption it works only because we
 want to observe consumption against long-term economic growth.
 That consumers differentiate between items for status also because their
 is a need associated with reference is discarded by the blanket assumption
 that all assets must grow and thus all consumption gives a felicity.
 All non-assets need not be consumed but invested in different streams -
 education is a different consumption from jewelry and so on.
 We therefore consider reference to be of key importance.
 That consumers must optimise value with respect to reference provides a
 better view of status consumption and does not require status consumption
 to be futile.
 Only fixing a function 
\begin_inset Formula $J(nu)$

 would tell us how soon the game would end etc..

Long-term effects of income differences on status competitions - The key
 observations we have is that narrowing income differences decreases significanc
e of status consumption.
 So while the short-term equilibrium would make us think that wider income
 differences make status competitions more stringent and status consumption
 higher, the long-term equilibrium imply a different dynamics where wider
 income differences reduce status consumption by either making promotion
 difficult or security cheaper.
 This result would result in an overall reduction of status consumption.

 Increasing omega_bar for

 a higher lambda_bar (from 1.04 to 1.5).
 This trend remains the same even for a higher

 This means that a higher security threshold is also needed as consumer
 promotion gets crowded when omega_bar rises (this does not change with

 for the poorer consumer a lesser income difference y_{2}-y_{1}.
 Decreasing

 The security becomes cheaper for less narrower income.
 When income difference is high the richer consumer are happy to spend on
 status consumption.
 Giving more income to the poor reduces the security required!! This is
 surprising.
 This seems to happen because giving more assets to the poor makes the rich-posi

[Next: greed and loss-aversion] It's worthwhile to look at what the idea
 of greed really means.
 When consumers have a preference for lower assets in the low band, the
 introduction of greed or contentment would can shift the equilibrium further.
 Contentment is just the name of loss-aversion associated.
 Consumers might be less loss-averse with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 in which case they are more content with lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, they might be in a regime where consumers don't like
 being less than 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 at all.
 We look at the contentment vs aspiration in the above setup for a given
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 .
 The consumer utility uses a reference function defined around long-term
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 so that there are two regimes.
 First, where being poor may not become successively bad.
 Second, is the regime where contentment is valuable and the consumer below
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 don't mind it too much compared to how much consumers with more wealth...
 .
 The other regime is when consumer are more greedy and people mind being
 poor a lot compared to being rich.
 We see how either of these regimes are influenced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

(This way we don't need to deal with measurement of g1/g2 but we can argue
 only what greed and contentment with assets implies).
 Greed can help us relieve the stringent 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}_{2}<\frac{\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}}{\kappa}+\overline{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}^{*}<\underbar{\kappa\ensuremath{\lambda}+}\underbar{\ensuremath{\omega}}$
\end_inset

.
 Future applications could apply risk-aversion levels.This needs to be explored
 further.
