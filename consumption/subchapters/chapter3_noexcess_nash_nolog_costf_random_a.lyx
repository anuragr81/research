Status competitions under extreme income differences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
While status-driven consumption and appeal for social mobility may have
 become more prominent in the post-industrial world, relative income differences
 seem to have remained as permanent as differences in long-term wealth.
 We explain how the social promise offered by status consumption may be
 constrained by finite economic growth in an economy - which we view as
 a set of disparate income bands that the consumers transition through to
 gain social mobility.
 Viewing status consumption as investments towards the probabilistic social
 mobility in the economy, we explore the interplay of contentment and aspiration
 in consumer choice to optimise wealth over the long-term.

%Compared to Oxoby,  has a direct role and is based on subjective lack of
 knowledge of the world.
 It is only through competitions that consumer form their identity and would
 make fairly random decisions before.
 Therefore they would put  thinking they have a fair chance of being a winner.
 That the long-term equilibrium does not allow that does not matter - since
 the consumers think it does not affect them.
 Unlike in Oxoby, a poor decision affects them monetarily if they make a
 bad decision (what does their fixed-horizon equilibrium imply) and they
 don't really get any non-monetary utility.
 Like Cole-Maliath - they get only monetary benefit.
 Status is implied only through the assets somebody acquires - a view that
 is fundamentally dependent on  (see Kornienko).
 The idea that consumers compensate for not having status is strictly represente
d as risk-taking consumers compensate by taking unlikely risks.
 The consumer gets utility from her own relative wealth as well.
 The band-membership represents the non-transactional advantages of consumers
 - that do affect the consumer's wealth - albeit indirectly.
 The poor want to associated with the rich by status consumption because
 it provides a certain promise of gaining non-transactionally.
 The rich want not to be associated with the poor because they fear that
 they may be disadvantaged.
 Our model is different from Cole Maliath in two fundamental ways - first
 we consider the long-term implications of the equilibrium - second we utility
 association with asset-accumulation.
 Income distributions matter in Cole-Maliath (and Korenienko).
 We look at huge significant differences in income distribution caused by
 regional or social barriers.
 We believe that this cannot be understood without a probability formulation
 - because utility from matching does involve consideration of probability.
 Desire for status is about aligning oneself with this probability - while
 simultanesouly choosing higher assets.
 We also allow - with a simpler formulation - for societies to differ in
 the degrees of their rat races.
 The raison d'etre of disposable income bands are the really long-term effects
 which consumers accept but have no control over (non-transactional aspects)[als
o see Krupka-Weber].

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
On one hand, status goods are those that indicate a consumer's exclusive
 status while on the other, they create bandwagons for those with low status.
 To understand this universal race to exclusivity, status consumption has
 often been associated with the consumer's reference group.
 When all consumers are set to benefit from higher status consumption, reference
 groups help pin down a certain level of status consumption as the consumers'
 social need.
 They clarify empirically whether a given status item is more valuable to
 those who already have higher status or to those who don't (e.g.
 by asking which reference groups the consumers in comparison may belong
 to).
 Lastly, the association helps answer whether the not-so-rich spend disproportio
nately higher on status items in an economy or that the high spending on
 status goods is limited to the rich.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Unlike the mechanisms of invidious comparison (IC) and pecuniary emulation
 (PE) identified by Veblen - concerns that are essentially normative - reference
 groups provide a descriptive context for status competitions where a consumer
 identifies her status.
 This is particularly important since the consumer's social need for status
 items is hardly as universal as it is for essential food or clothing.
 With social needs determined by the consumer's interaction with others
 in the economy, the demand for status items necessarily depends on social
 participation and exclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-transactional environments of consumer choice and the uncertainty
 inherent in perception of status have been explored in the literature on
 status consumption - most particularly by Cole-Maliath
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"

\end_inset

 and Hopkins-Kornienko
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In the proposed chapter, we rely on the framework to explore consumer choice
 under extreme income inequalities that may develop due to geographic, occupatio
nal or social differences.
 We take an approach similar to Cole-Maliath
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in assuming that consumer does not obtain utility directly from the reference
 but through variables in her utility that are shaped by her reference.
 We focus in particular on the uncertainty arising out of non-transactional
 choices that contribute to the consumer's future expectations from status
 competitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of our argument is that if status goods - such as jewelry or a
 club membership - offered status utility that is not any more uncertain
 than the purchase from savings of the expensive long-term assets such as
 a house or a private jet, the representative consumer would know of the
 futility of status consumption (compared to saving towards higher wealth).
 The substitution between saving and consumption in the intertemporal substituti
on framework is therefore not suitable for understanding status consumption
 unless one considers either i) that the consumer's utility is subject to
 the risk implied by status consumption or ii) that the status items offer
 a utility different from the one that is derived from regular goods.
 While the latter option of splitting utility into visible and non-visible
 terms has its advantages, we find that the distinctions between items that
 provide status utility and those that provide regular utility may be more
 difficult to justify under environments of extreme income inequalities
 (e.g.
 in developing economies where relative wealth is more easily visible).
 This motivates the proposed approach to viewing status consumption as the
 consumer's risky position in an intertemporal framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like Hopkins-Kornienko

\end_inset

 - who explore status competitions for a given distribution of success-determini
ng attributes in a population of consumers - we consider the inequality
 in rewards different from inequality in incomes in a specific instance
 of persistent (long-term) income inequalities.
 With near-permanent income inequalities, the consumer's hope to overcome
 the persistent inequality coincides with the promise of status competitions
 where status consumption is rewarded.
 In an approach similar to Cole-Maliath
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 , we use a finite set of income bands so that the transition probabilities
 among them determine the future wealth states of the consumer and her expectati
ons towards the future.
 The basic needs of the consumer are supposed to be already met in this
 economy so that the only option the consumer faces is to either save towards
 future assets or spend her income above needs towards status consumption.
 A fundamental assumption for the transition probability is that it encompasses
 all possible paths which a consumer could follow to rise in the hierarchy
 of income bands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model we develop, the utility from the consumer's future wealth consists
 both of the current value of assets and the probability of being in the
 same or different income-bands in the future.
 We assume that the probabilities that define the transition to successive
 income bands are the same for all consumers within an income band.
 Further, the consumers are meant to discover their success only through
 performance in the status competitions.
 Over time, the preferences as well as the success-determining attributes
 of the consumers remain unchanged as they transition across income bands.
 We also consider the implications of long-term inequalities on the equilibria
 assuming that the population of consumers in the income bands does not
 change over time.
 While the processes of accumulation and inheritance ensure that the assets
 acquired by consumers in various income bands do grow apart over time,
 they also imply a certain mobility through status competitions for all
 participants in order to assist fairness and stability among the income
 bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth highlighting that the status of the consumer is encompassed
 solely by the assets she would amass in a probable future.
 Therefore, the status comparisons are based not on the total assets at
 a time but the expected assets within a certain time-horizon.
 By means of an example, consider a classical musician who may be perceived
 to have a higher status than a country musician even though the latter
 has amassed a higher fortune.
 While all consumers are meant to maximise their assets acquisitions, a
 higher status can be associated to the classical musician in the model
 since it is the expected wealth over a finite time horizon that represents
 status (the rich consumers also bear a possibility of decline).
 The comparison between the two musicians depends foremost on whether they
 are in the same income band or not.
 When they are in the same income band, they participate in the same status
 competitions and the classical musician could - while relying on sublimity
 of her music and a sophistication curated over centuries - be more prepared
 for being in a higher income-band.
 Similarly, when the classical musician belongs to the poorer income band,
 the possibility that the poorer musician may have higher status is not
 completely ruled out either (when the classical consumer is in a richer
 band, her higher status is trivially implied).
 Even though being in a poorer income band implies that most classical musicians
 have a lower status than most country musicians (the listeners having a
 higher preference for classical musicians cannot result in lower income
 for classical musicians over time), the higher attribution of status for
 a poorer classical musician is possible if for example there is a popular
 association of decadence with the riches and thus a lower future expectation
 of wealth (in a finite time horizon).
 This notion of status similar to the status-is-wealth equilibria described
 by Cole-Maliath

 Associating the matching process from Cole-Maliath

  with a transition in income bands, we also account for the poorer consumer
 having a propensity to remain within her income band due to the localised
 notions of status.
 This is permitted by letting the consumer with lower assets in a poorer
 band have a higher utility than she would for the same level of assets
 in a richer band.
 In the proposed formulation of status under extreme income differences
 with stable band populations, we find that status consumption are intensified
 as the income inequalities rise in an economy.

Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of our model is to look at how the demand for status consumption
 changes under an environment of disparate clusters of disposable income.
 The consumer identity to these distinct bands implies different disposable
 incomes to the consumer.
 This is equivalent to the more commonly used assumption of wealth growing
 at a constant growth rate - where a similar clustering of wealth would
 imply immense variation in interest income across bands.
 The separation of consumers among income bands means that being in the
 band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 provides disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in a given period to the consumer.
 The choice which the consumer faces is to either save to gain the utility
 from assets staying in their income band or spend a certain amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 out of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to participate in a status competition which would promote her to a higher
 income band.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the income bands range from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in an economy, the promotion of a consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to the next income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 is provided with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the highest band 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer could also be demoted to an immediate lower income band 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (not defined for the lowest band 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
 The consumer chooses 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 from her disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 to maximise the expected utility from the future assets in the respective
 income bands she may be in the future.
 The incomes are distinguished based solely upon rewards of status competitions
 i.e.
 the differences in disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1...n}$
\end_inset

 that are provided in the respective income band (the disposable income
 excludes the cost of a consumer's needs and is the same for all consumers
 in a particular asset-band).
 We summarise the assumption as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:def_band"

\end_inset

The incomes bands are characterised only by the levels of disposable incomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final goal of every consumer in the model is to have the highest assets
 in the economy.
 Since the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 in every band can be used to accumulate towards assets or participate in
 tournaments of unobserved ability, the wealth differences among consumers
 in this economy arise either due to differences in starting assets or due
 to performance in status competitions.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the status competitions are provided structurally by the social institutions
 to grant some mobility across income bands while not completely getting
 rid of the stratification that prevents more participation.
 A success in status competitions serves both as an evidence of ability
 and as a barrier to entry for those with less proven abilities.
 The ability pertinent to one's status may be innate, unobserved and responsible
 for success in the status competitions, but it is relevant only through
 probabilistic monetary success in the long-term and is revealed to the
 consumer only through status competitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As chance favours the prepared, more status consumption increases the probabilit
y of one's successes in the status competitions through the function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and decreases that of failure 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 (and equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 ) is defined so that a consumer with a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is rewarded more often and so that no amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can ever provide guarantee to be in the next band (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 for high 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 are assumed to have the same structure across income bands (
\begin_inset Formula $\forall k$
\end_inset

) except due to thresholds relevant for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in every income-band.
 In other words, the outlier performers in every band would be dispersed
 with the same distribution in the long-term equilibrium while the consumers
 would maintain different levels of status consumption in every band to
 have a chance to be promoted to the higher band.
 A lower band (e.g.
 a poorer underlcass in an economy or a poorer country in the global economy)
 may thus have a lower base-consumption (e.g.
 mean) on status goods (or cheaper status goods) but the outperformers in
 a poor environment are expected to improve their fortunes through the same
 mechanism that a consumer in a higher-income band (or in a richer country)
 would.
 This is a fundamental assumption for the status competitions in the model
 that determines the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Assumption
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "assu:natural_competition"

\end_inset

The mechanism for the competitions are fundamentally the same across all
 bands except for differences in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

-reference levels pertaining to each band.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in Section in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:intro"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the consumers of varying characteristics (age, skills, talent etc.) observe
 the same likelihood of promotion to the next band as long as they are in
 the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 - so that 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{k}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 offer exactly the same probability to all the consumers in the band 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Further, since the status competitions in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 to be promoted to band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 are not open to any consumers in a band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that is lower than the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

, it follows that for a consumer to be in a band higher than the next she
 must go through the next band.
 We thus state the following implication of the above assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "cor:sequential_rise"

\end_inset

A consumer in band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can reach to another band 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 only by going through bands 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1,...,j-1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Corollary 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cor:sequential_rise"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 implies a Markovian property for the consumer's future utility from assets.
 Status is the expected future utility at any point that the consumers optimise
 with the income received in their income band by either staying in the
 same band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 or having moved to any of the bands different from their own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Properties of a Short-term Equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above set up for status competitions implies a short-term Nash equilibrium
 as consumers optimise total accumulated assets subject to their band-reference
 in a given period.
 The simplest instance of this short-term optimisation is one where the
 consumers optimise the assets accumulated in a single period.
 In other word, the representative consumer just has one life and a one
 shot-investment to make towards her life-time status.
 We also consider that the consumer receives a higher utility from the same
 value of assets when she is in a poorer band compared to when she is in
 a richer band.
 Note that the utility to the consumer considers the total assets acquired
 by the consumer rather than the new income received in successive period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the consumers optimise savings at the end of the first-time horizon,
 we do not expect them to spend on status consumption at the end of their
 lives.
 This very idea that the consumers optimise value at a finite-time horizon
 means that the state - poorer or richer - after the finite horizon is not
 of no concern to the consumer.
 This holds for also for when higher number of periods (i.e.
 greater than 1) are considered.
 The consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 in the last period is thus always zero for all the consumers regardless
 of how much wealth they have amassed.

 With higher assets to start with, the consumers are expected to be less
 worried about asset loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above short-term equilibrium expects that the narrowing of income reduce
 status consumption as well as the risk with future assets.
 Since there are limits to how much savings alone can improve the consumer's
 wealth, taking more risk through status consumption is hardly a waste for
 the consumer in the model.
 The risk through status competitions in fact works to reduce asset inequality.
 Whether improving savings (i.e.
 increase 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 alone) - which does not spur status consumption - counters the effects
 of intrinsic income inequalities in the long-term or not is not certain
 due to the finite-horizon over which we have considered the equilibrium.
 To understand the long-term implications of the above model, now consider
 the long-term choice of the consumer in Section

reference "subsec:Long-term-equilibrium"
plural "false"
caps "false"

 As we further elaborate, the conditions for a long-term equilibrium with
 income-inequalities present a significant constraint to the above set up
 and require additional condition for long-term stability.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to incorporate the implications of persistent long-term inequalities
 in the model, we consider first what a long-term equilibrium with stable
 populations of consumers in the income bands would mean for status competitions.
 To understand the implications of both long-term inequalities and status
 competitions, consider first that without any status consumption, the disparate
 disposable incomes across two bands cannot provide a stable long-term equilibri
um due to the ever-growing gaps in accumulated wealth.
 More specifically, the accumulations 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}=\sum_{t}^{T}\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the disposable income for the band 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}y_{i}=y_{i}\forall t$
\end_inset

 ) would lead to unstable differences in accumulated wealth across bands
 over time.
 This is no different from the assumption of stable growth of assets where
 too the different starting assets would imply disparate interest-incomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could thus say that the presence of status competitions might allow
 the income inequalities to prevail.
 If the preferences for all consumers are the same, an equilibrium may be
 implied in an economy with different bands of disposable incomes if the
 consumers can move across bands often enough.
 Since long-term inequalities in income are persistent through the long-term
 equilibrium, the status competitions which the consumers participate in
 must be population-preserving in the sense that in the long-run the number
 of consumers who leave an income band must be balanced by those who enter
 the income band.
 An equilibrium with long-term income inequalities cannot exist if not for
 such a population preserving status competition.
 We thus observe the status competitions within such a population preserving
 mechanism - equivalent to a scheme where an equal number of consumers are
 selected in successive bands and swapped with each other at a certain cost
 (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:WinnersandlosersChainExchange"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The presence of status consumption implies that the richer band would spend
 proportionately higher on status competitions and the long-term equilibrium
 would sustain income inequalities across the bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
[DESCRIBE IT FORMALLY HERE] Before we elaborate this result in more formal
 terms

, notice that the asset accumulations of the consumers would necessarily
 spread around if the consumers were randomly selected to be swapped between
 income bands.
 As long as all consumers eventually get a fair chance to participate in
 the exchange, a stable equilibrium would allow assets to spread around
 consumers in different bands.
 This is because the consumers would be wary of giving up more by losing
 their current band when they move up the income bands and care less about
 losing their current band as they won't risk being shunned in the lowest
 bands.
 That said, status competitions may never be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and characterised by how they favour those with higher expenditure within
 a band.
 With all else being the same, higher education expenditure or club memberships
 in a life-time does have a higher likelihood of social mobility.
 With the probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu),L(\nu_{k})$
\end_inset

, we can consider a swap mechanism - where the same number of consumers
 are exchanged between successive income bands - ensuring the stability
 of populations of income bands.
 The assets are carried by the consumer so the selection of winners and
 losers does move the wealth around to some extent.
 Whether status competitions offer mobility or not in the model - depends
 on how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the competitions characterised by 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{k}(\nu)$

 Instead, we rely on specific forms of

 The past success itself is the only relevant determinant of success and
 the consumer identity in the model.
 The essential argument using this approach is that in real-world circumstances,
 such as occupational or marriage markets, the consumers know about their
 abilities only through participation (through expenditures in education
 or social activities) where their past success as well as starting wealth
 determine their future decisions of

 i.e.
 the consumers do not use anything from savings towards the status consumption.
 It is worth emphasising that the utility to the consumer considers the
 total assets acquired by the consumer rather than the new income received
 in successive periods.
 The consumers are assumed to save everything up at the end of first period
 i.e.
 they do not spend on status consumption at the end of their lives.
 This holds for when higher number of periods are considered - the consumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 in the last period is always zero for all the consumers regardless of how
 much wealth they have amassed.

\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\prescript{t}{}\nu_{2}$

 accordingly.
 While a symmetric Nash equilibrium can be specific with finite time horizons,
 we are interested in the long-term equilibrium conditions as the inequalities
 that we're interested in are also sustained in the long-term.
 Further, the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\nu_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu_{2})$

 are defined only for stable populations of the bands - which leads us to
 the following assumption.

, the consumer's horizon coincides with that of 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\nu_{1}),W(\nu_{2})$
\end_inset

 and the short-term Nash equilibria are population-stable status competitions.
 The direct implication of the population stability of income bands 1 and
 2 is that the consumers in band 1 that are promoted to band 2 are balanced
 by the consumers in band 2 being demoted to band 1.
 The population-stability constraint in the long-term equilibrium implies
 that

The above condition implies that the consumer balances her expected future
 income with the costs on her wealth state.
 The net asset value from being either in band 1 or band 2 would be balanced
 by the expected returns the consumer 1 gets from putting up 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

 towards status consumption.
 Since the probability

 must be positive and less than unity, the ratio

 In other words, the consumer in band 1 must move from a negative net asset-valu

As long as status competition is feasible for consumer 1, she should see
 an increase in the long-term net asset value by being in band 2.
 The possibility of moving from band 1 to band 2 only to observe the net
 asset value decline is ruled out because higher income bands are also meant
 to have a higher asset reference.
 Any peer effects associated with the assets (or a higher reference level
 for assets) would ensure a higher asset reference in the higher asset-band.
 Thus while the consumer in band 1 cannot afford to have a decline in net
 asset value if she moves to the next band, the consumer in the rich band
 might accept a poorer band with a net increase in asset value.
 This implies that the the net asset-value function must be concave with
 the two consumers perched at the roots of net asset function 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(A)$

.
 Figure

 A concave net asset value function eventually corresponds to convex costs
 associated with the asset - which is plausible when there costs increase
 both for extremely high wealth levels and for extremely low wealth levels.

 Acting as a long-standing dynasty, the consumers in such an equilibrium
 consider both the short-term horizon in which they would become richer

The above conditions also imply that in the long-term equilibrium, a higher

 Similarly, a higher

% Discontinuity: Before reset the the consumer accumulates and after the
 reset her asset disappears.
 The combined utility is maximised the final expected assets and the consumer
 cannot maximise at t=1 without considering what happens after (e.g.
 another consumer comes, L,W change etc.).
 Further, since the choice at t=1 is different from choice at t=0 if considering
 the next period alone, a single nu for two time periods can only be forced.
  The total assets which we consider are different in the current assets
 where the decision is being made.
 The same asset can be enjoyed more in the poorer band and that matters
 only when utilities are considered i.e.
 after summing them up over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% Draw: We are still not clear about when the draw occurs.
 This makes the idea of optimising assets-without-risk-of-loss somewhat
 difficult.
 Consumer's can only optimise assets post draw.
 In two successive periods, if consumer take a part of their y into nu.
 they only care about u from final A not intermediate u.
 So no addition of intertemporal utility is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% Forcing single nu: If we force a single nu then we can comment on what
 consumer loses by choosing too high nu.
 In words, choosing a high nu focuses too much the transition and the consumer
 loses in the short-term.
 Choosing too low - gives her assets in the short-term but she does not
 care about the long-term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% Discarding intertemporal substitution - The solution with intertemporal
 utility has the advantage that it provides a control for whether consumers
 care more about the long-term transition or the the accumulation.
 Long-term movements are not influenced by savings at all (all savings are
 meant to go to waste in the long run).
 This also allows us to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

approximate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the case with general  with a discount-factor.
 The intertemporal methods does however go against the central argument
 that consumers optimise long-term accumulations.
 We are left with no options but to rely on the same nu for both periods
 in order to explain the substitution between later and earlier risk.

% Notice that asset-costs as a function of assets is only an imagination.
 The costs imposed by assets are not fully captured in the reported asset-costs
 in the empirical data.
 A function that combines the  costs imposed by cars with costs imposed
 by houses - needs to average over a lot of thing.
 For the for fitting purposes itself, estimating a function that considers
 the number cars and houses owned would have be better - but that isn't
 what we're concerned with.
 For this reasons, the asset-cost function shape must not be relied on.
 Instead how a given fitted value of cost-function would impact the net
 equilibrium is more interesting.
 We are interested only in the condition in Equation  being satisfied -
 without estimating the entire function itself.
 Therefore, the assumption with a known cost-function (whatever its shape
 as long as the two consumers are on either side of the inflection point)
 must suffice.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[IT'S ALREADY OBVIOUS that extreme differences in income would increase
 status consumption since the consumers would bet more - what does the model
 add ]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 It considers 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}/\Gamma_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 - For interpretation, know that the model considers betting as the only
 way out of income differences.
 If the differences in income are permanent, then the consumers would not
 want to compete with the higher income group by saving.
 The real interaction is between 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}/\Gamma_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, then.
 We can say that the utility from being poor may be more significant when
 communication increases i.e.
 the consumer no longer feels content in the poor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 The distinction between waste and upward mobility does seem to be obfuscated
 in this model.
 That's because the difference is not always clear in the real-world (because
 consumers consider something a waste only after reconciling their past
 expenditure).
 The extreme income differences have the role of segregating as well - because
 consumers don't spend on anything (or are influenced by things) that would
 improve the lives of the band above them.
 There is a practical utility from the status consumption in the real world
 - while we don't distinguish between waste and means for upward mobility,
 we argue that the status consumption is necessitated by this struggle and
 is wasteful only in the wider context - not in the narrow status comparison
 reference where it is necessitated.
 Faced with income inequalities, the consumers must weigh the local hierarchy
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

) against the status advantages.
 Our interpretation for status consumption consider both 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W,L$
\end_inset

 .
 Increases in inequalities might increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

 in a way that makes more inequalities acceptable (and vice versa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contrast with the conventional Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the conventional approach of the intertemporal substitution, we would
 argue that there is an observed rate of growth of assets which the consumer
 - but this interest rate is a huge assumption it works only because we
 want to observe consumption against long-term economic growth.
 That consumers differentiate between items for status also because their
 is a need associated with reference is discarded by the blanket assumption
 that all assets must grow and thus all consumption gives a felicity.
 All non-assets need not be consumed but invested in different streams -
 education is a different consumption from jewelry and so on.
 We therefore consider reference to be of key importance.
 That consumers must optimise value with respect to reference provides a
 better view of status consumption and does not require status consumption
 to be futile.
 Only fixing a function 
\begin_inset Formula $J(nu)$
\end_inset

 would tell us how soon the game would end etc..
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[COMPARISON with intertemporal model does not arise in two-period models]
 At this point it is worth contrasting this approach with the typical intertempo
ral substitution approach where all assets must be consumed at the point.
 Our approach is similar except that it refines the utility from the final
 consumption as a bet towards the final asset-band.
 So we have assumed a risk-neutral consumer who only ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical intertemporal substitution model also assumes the opposite of
 what have by using the assumption that nothing survives of the assets except
 for the consumption.
 What we're saying is that only that all consumption and accumulation must
 go to asset-band identity.
 That is like saying that effective wealth is zero at the end and the assets
 grow at a certain rate.
