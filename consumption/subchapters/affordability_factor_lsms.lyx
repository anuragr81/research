Determining Status ranking from the LSMS data in Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LSMS survey records neither the price nor the quantity consumed for
 any non-food quantities.
 Instead of differences in prices (which are unavailable), we test whether
 differences in per-head consumption in the population within a region could
 represent the variants of different prices which can be used to calculated
 the affordability factor (i.e.
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}-max(p_{k})$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This exercise is neither trivial and not fully reliable at this point -
 but an effort to detect the variants of the same item or group of items
 with different prices in the market.
 In the absence of price data, we hope to use some knowledge of the supply
 side to improve our interpretation of price from average cost data.
 We begin with identifying clusters in the per head consumption cost after
 accounting for control variables related to usage of the item e.g.
 more per-head electricity costs should be scaled with number of appliances
 the household may have (which is available in data).
 In absence of prices, this ad-hoc test needs to be performed on a case-by-case
 basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The significance of control variables denoting the usage of related assets
 owned by the consumer and the lack of any clustering (in average consumption
 scaled by usage) would imply that the status is indicated by the asset
 ownership instead (and thus the average consumption consumption doesn't
 need to be counted for the status impact).
 For example, since per-head electricity cost is higher for those with electroni
c equipment - we would conclude that consumer raises her ranking by owning
 electronic equipment and having electricity - rather than by choosing a
 higher price option for electricity.
 We thus ignore the consumption of electricity for testing of signaling
 quantities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If clusters of prices are observed after scaling (regression) with the usage
 variable, we use the cluster prices as input to our affordability factor
 calculation.
 As a sanity check, we may also verify the factors that may influence the
 choice of a higher price item - e.g.
 with a probit on the dummy of cluster's average-consumption being above
 or below the cluster price threshold as the dependent variable and the
 total expenditure, housingstatus, education, relevant asset etc.
 as control variables.
 This however, is not the part of the methodology to detect price difference
 through average consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our eventual goal is to identify the price differences which the consumer
 observes to build her utility tree.
 These trees are are shown for Tanzania LSMS data in the Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tree1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tree2"

\end_inset

.
 The overall status from consumption of an individual consumer is simply
 the aggregation of affordability factor (or a similar metric) at the root
 of the tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking an example where this methodology might work, we consider the cost-per-he
ad for kerosene which varies a lot in dar-es-salaam (region 7)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We have assumed there are no secondary markets or hoarding for items in
 consideration
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We clearly cannot claim that the differences in consumption cost per head
 imply a price differentiation for kerosene - simply because availability
 of electricity in Dar-es-salaam can change the usage of kerosene in the
 household (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ElectricityvsKeroseneCosts"

\end_inset

).
 What we can do for dar-es-salaam (or any region where electricity is also
 available) is to consider electricity and kerosene as the variants of energy
 level in tree and treat electricity as a higher price variant of the energy-sou
rce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all problems can be circumvented with such an aggregation either.
 One cannot for example, use per-head consumption costs to detect price
 differentiation for cigarettes - where the most significant factor affecting
 high consumption is simply be the addiction of the consumer - the data
 on which is not available in the survey.
 We are compelled to ignore smoking for our analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible that the asset itself - related to the consumed good
 whose average consumption we test for price-differentiation - has more
 variants of different prices than those of consumed good.
 For example, detergent that serves clothes may not be varied but the washing
 machine where detergents are used could be more nuanced.
 Unfortunately we do not have even the cost estimate on assets owned by
 the household - so we are left with ignoring this possibility at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most other non-food commodities, either aggregation and/or cluster-detection
 could help identify the price-differentiation.
 If we look at the per-head consumption cost on bar soap, there seem to
 be two cost clusters in region dar-es-salaam - the dummy of per-head-consumptio
n-cost <6000 (i.e.
 the cluster dummy) finds roomsnum, language and occupation all significant
 (total expenditure is not) i.e.
 those with a better-paying occupations and English-speaking abilities tend
 to spend disproportionately on bar-soap - this difference in consumption
 per-head costs could be used as the price-difference in our original sense.
 The similar cluster dummy for detergent is not found significant (except
 for roomsnum in dar-es-salaam ) - hence we ignore detergents for price-differen
tiation.
 It can't be denied that such inferences are ad-hoc and dependent on whether
 there are any assets that may justify higher per-head consumption cost
 or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our end-goal is to differentiate the status-impact of consumption from the
 status-impact of assets and then consider a combined status impact form
 assets and consumption - so we may fit the function for consumption from
 status goods into the intertemporal substitution problem.
 The relative assets-ownership ranking of consumers is an important part
 of this exercise.
 The LSMS data does not have even the cost information for assets owned,
 so we only consider the number of items owned for asset-ownership ranking
 of consumes i.e.
 if someone has more assets than another person who has less or none of
 the same asset, then all else being equal the former is invariably of higher
 status than the latter.
 Since our goal is to finally combine the asset-ranking and consumption
 ranking, we avoid double-counting the role of assets - since a lot of items
 are not consumed simply because the asset related to it is not owned by
 the consumer.

Comparing consumption across commodities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prices are recorded for a set of quantities.
 These quantities are nearly the same for (mls, litres, g, kgs, pieces)
 for both recorded prices and consumed quantities.
 However, not all food items are recorded - so we must rely on the inferred
 prices for the most part.
 In fact, if we were to filter out of all the items where price is not recorded
 (NA), we would be only left with about 500 households (for 2010).
 Such a filter is a very restrictive one and we choose to depend on recorded_pri
ce alone for premium - we use it for guided value wherever it is available.
 When multiple prices are recorded for the same quantity (or for a different
 quantity) - we choose the recorded_price that is closest to the inferred
 price.
 The matching is never done on quantities - only on prices.
 Across all regions only the following items have multiple prices recorded
 - Peas/Lentils - 401 , Onions-tomatoes 601, Millet-grain 106, Spinach 602
 , Seafood 808, Bread 109, Local brews 107, Yams 204, Cassava-flour 202
 Fruits 703.
 Staying close to the recorded price ensures that we only have slight measuremen
t errors in our technique and an double-evidence for clustering in prices.
 Unfortunately market prices are not recorded for all region codes in the
 survey.
 Even if prices were recorded on a ward or district level (ignoring the
 ea level) prices recorded are still quite rare.
 Only about 30% of the total purchases can be matched up with recorded -
 prices.
 Of those where prices can be matched, about 15% of the inferred-prices
 deviate more than 50% from the closest recorded price.
 We could think of matching with the price-quantity relatonship but the
 market prices are not rich enough for that.
 Where multiple prices are recorded they indicate the variety of items rather
 than the different quantities.
 Following prices for cassava/dry flour indicate the difference between
 cassava and its dry flour in the market.
 The disparity in prices justifies the price-matching.
 Unfortunately, there are quite some errors in recorded market price - such
 as prices being far lower by a magnitude (e.g.

 has less than 10th of the price).
 The evidence of items with multiples prices aggregated in one category
 (e.g.
 in cassava dry/flour or onions/tomatoes category) necessitates that we
 view the different items as of same conspicuous value.

The use of market-recorded prices are to adjust the effective of region
 on prices.
 We observe that a some prices can be very skewed (local brews 107).
 Some data is clearly bad (e.g.
 for eggs, canned milk).
 Chicken seems highly skewed.
 Taken over all regions, the highest kurtosis (not much difference in prices)
 is observed for charcoal (207), milling-grain fees(208), Maize-flour(105),
 Sugar(301), Salt(1003), Fruits (703) , Beef(802), Eggs(807).
 Less kurtosis (diffusion) is in Millet-grain(106), Bread(109), Irish potatoes(2
05), Coconuts (502), Onions-tomatoes (601) - different items, Spinach(602),
 Dry-tea(1101).
 Next are Kerosene (201), Maize cob (103), Cassava (201), Plantains (206),
 Groundnuts (501), Chicken (804), Local Brews (1107).
 Still lower kurtosis (higher differences) are in Sweet potatoes (203),
 Bananas (701), Citric Fruits (702), Fish-Seafood (808), Milk(901), Cooking
 oil (1001).
 Lowest kurtosis is found husked rice (102), MaizeGrain (104), Millet-Flour(107)
, Cassava-dryflour (202), Yams/cocoyams(204) (two varieties), Peas/lentils(401),
 Goat meat (801).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to back out the prices from expenditure, then we must ensure
 that the expenditure recorded is accurate.
 Unfortunately, there are many outliers in the data.
 Sometimes, only one person in a district is recorded.
 This magnifies the effect of the outlier observation on the price.
 The aggregation of prices can only be done at region level for that purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Filtering data further
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We check for skewness of prices in order to filter out bad households with
 bad prices.
 We excluded that households with report expenditure of these ~20 households.
 One option is to smoothen the price data - but Deaton simply removes the
 cluster means from prices in the regression (with the fixed effects model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Measuring quality in food products
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An analysis of quality based on price differences of the commodities used
 was done by Houthakker.
 Deaton has repeated this analysis with for estimates of cross-sectional
 elasticities - extracting quality elasticities to study the effect of price
 on consumption.
 A group of identified items can be grouped let's say in group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tree1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tree2"

\end_inset

).
 The price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 varies based on region (we aggregate prices on region level - since reliable
 data on prices is not available at district level).
 We group commodities in set of groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}q_{i}=x=\sum_{G\in\mathbb{\mathscr{G}}}P_{G}Q_{G}$
\end_inset

.
 We defined 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{G}=\sum_{i\in G}q_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 To keep the structure of prices the same (by assuming that the prices in
 every group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 move together), we can think of a base price (see Nelson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

) a quality indicator (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

) so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}=\sum_{i\in G}p_{i}^{*}q_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The quality factor 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

attempts to explain the higher expenditure on a commodity 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (which can be referred to as elementary commodity).
 Writing prices of elementary commodity in terms of this factor, we have
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
p_{i} & =P_{G}p_{i}^{*}\label{eq:P_Gdefinition}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

The definition of

\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 move proportionally - so that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 is simply the constant proportionality factor of prices (see Nelson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

).
 We can finally write:
\end_layout

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) which can be associated with a unit price 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Note that we denote expenditure in the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{G}(=P_{G}Q_{G})$

 Taking logarithms of Equation

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ \nu_{G}$
\end_inset

 gives us the measure of quality that we're interested in for status purposes.
 We can justify group based on status benefits the consumer may derive from
 products in every group (rare items or items with barriers).
 Differentiating the above equation with 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\ P_{G}$
\end_inset

can give us an estimate of the quality elasticities.

\begin_inset Formula $x_{ic}$
\end_inset

 is the total expenditure, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ic}$
\end_inset

 is vector of personal characteristics (e.g.
 number of family members), 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{Gc}$
\end_inset

 are the prices in the cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 for each group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{G}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{kc}$
\end_inset

 is a cluster specified fixed effect and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{kic}^{0}$
\end_inset

 is the error component.
 Notice that the equation does not fulfill the criteria of a demand equation
 (the constraints of homogeneity, adding up are not necessarily satisfied).
 Deaton removes cluster and price effects by subtraction of within-cluster
 means to obtain the following equations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
(ln\ q_{Gic}-ln\ q_{G\cdot c}) & =\beta_{G}^{0}(ln\ x_{ic}-ln\ x_{\cdot c})+\gamma_{G}^{0}\cdot(z_{ic}-z_{\cdot c})+(u_{Gic}^{0}-u_{G\cdot c}^{0})\label{eq:Deatonmodel_diffq}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
(ln\ V_{kic}-ln\ V_{k\cdot c}) & =\beta_{k}^{1}(ln\ x_{ic}-ln\ x_{\cdot c})+\gamma_{k}^{1}(z_{ic}-z_{\cdot c})+(u_{kic}^{1}-u_{k\cdot c}^{1})\label{eq:deatonmodel_diffv}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 with an example,let's assume we have 
\begin_inset Formula $G={beef,lamb}$
\end_inset

 .
 If prices for beef and lamb are 100/kg and 120/kg respectively, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}$
\end_inset

 being a constant in the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, it is simply 100 (cheapest commodity price) while the quality-indicator/base-p
rice vector 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,1.2\}$
\end_inset

 (see Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:P_Gdefinition"

\end_inset

).
 Now let's assume there are two consumers whose consumption vectors for
 beef and lamb
\begin_inset Formula $\{q_{beef},q_{lamb}\}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,1.2\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{.5,.7\}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 We can easily calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{G}=\sum_{i\in G}q_{i}$
\end_inset

 as 2.2 and 1.2 respectively (see Nelson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NelsonQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

 for a criticism of this unweighted adding of quantities).
 Similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{G}=\sum_{i\in G}p_{i}^{*}q_{i}$
\end_inset

 turns out to be
\begin_inset Formula $1\cdot1+1.2\cdot1.2=2.44$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\cdot.5+1.2\cdot.7=1.34$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 We can thus verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{G}Q_{G}$
\end_inset

 is the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\in G}p_{i}q_{i}$
\end_inset

 (244 and 134 respectively).
 If we were to convert all consumed quantities of fruits consumed to calories,
 for example, then we can measure 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{G}$
\end_inset

 in calories and 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{*}$
\end_inset

as the per calorie quality factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have selected household characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ic}$
\end_inset

 as 
\bar under
occupation rank
\bar default
, 
\bar under
highest education level
\bar default
 and 
\bar under
number of family members
\bar default
.
 Alternatively, we use average prices that are closed to market prices (not
 all market prices are available in the data) and avoid measurement errors
 in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:deatonmodel_lnq"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:deatonmodel_lnv"

\end_inset

.
 Still another method we could use is the MLE specification of the model
 formulated by Dong et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DongShonkwierCappsQualityQuantity"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal to use a demand equation is not achieved in the above equation.
 All we can ascertain is that quality is compromised or not for poorer household
s.
 The effect of clusters is important because it indicates the availability
 issue.
 A relative price structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

is the measure of affordability we were looking for - a justified quality
 measure is all one can see with the food data.
 The methods used for elasticity are not associated with a utility function
 as such.
 This is an analysis we have to do ourselves.
 The goal of personal characteristics in Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Deatonmodel_diffq"

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:deatonmodel_diffv"

\end_inset

 is to simple net out.
 The literature that we have explored tends to use the effect of personal
 characteristics as evidence of social differences.
 A corresponding analysis doesn't find anything special other than supply
 side issues.
 We also find that the expenditure on marriage is lower in areas where there
 is electricity - marking the industrial developments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assignment of food items into groups needs to accomplish two goals.
 First is to ensure the separability of utility.
 The classification into sugars, condiments, starch, fish-seafood, meat,
 vegetables, fruits and beverages is based on the calorific density of food
 items and the food habits of the population.
 It is not difficult to see that a representative consumer would not overspend
 on sugars to cut down expenditure on bread for example.
 The second goal is to ensure that the group constituent prices move together.
 We are yet to verify this claim for every group using a long enough time-series
 data of prices on the supply side but we have tried to create more groups
 based on the source of supply (avoiding putting meat and fish in the same
 protein category for example).
 Although we look for status relevance of quality, it is worth emphasizing
 again that status utility is aggregated from across different commodities.
 When looking at differences in quality of food consumed, we're only interested
 in status indicated through food quality.
 While certain household characteristics like education, income, class,
 second language may have more significance for consumption certain commodities
 but that may simply be because of supply side asymmetries i.e.
 better quality food may be available in areas where there is electricity
 and where higher income, English speaking people reside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grouping many foods into one is hardly trivial.
 Nelson describes the use of nutritional values in categorization (use of
 calorific value rather than weight).
 This would simply mean that our quantity consumed must be multiplied by
 the calorific value per weight before a quality factor can be calculated.
 We use the USDA database 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "USDA"

\end_inset

 for the weighted sum of quantities (to).
 The calorific values are incorporated by adjusting the observed quantities
 - using the assumption that a consumer demand for food is limited by calorific
 intake.
 Indeed some food purchases could be stored for a long time and may be for
 cattle or pets as well - but it a verification with the household characteristi
cs would be a part of robustness check for our interpretation.
 Further, we keep alcohol consumption separate from other beverages and
 do not adjust alcohol quantities based on calorific - leaving the alcohol
 consumption to be budgeted simply by volume.
 We group the food categories imagining a scenario where substitution is
 possible on grounds of quality compromises.
 The classical butter vs oil substitution for example leaves butter and
 margarine in the same group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assigning prices is subject to a lot of problems.
 While we do have market prices available, they either deviate far too much
 from consumed quantities.
 There is a dilemma in choosing the backed-out prices as 
\begin_inset Formula $(e/q)$
\end_inset

 - which indicates the quality - replacing the value with market prices
 may suppress that information.
 On the other hand, the recorded expenditure may be subject to variation
 in supply prices themselves (which are not recorded in the market prices
 with the same granularity as that of expenditure).
 There are advantages and disadvantages with either approach.
 If we were to rely only on choices between two items (instead of choice
 of sub-items with price differences within the item), then choosing the
 market price seems the right approach.

The tree of commodities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once prices are cleaned (outlying priced purchases removed), then we can
 aggregate the relative prices at every state of purchase in the tree.
 The relative price was supposed to be distribution of items.
 One particular house 0102003003016101 for example, spends on sugar (301),
 Onions/tomatoes(601), Fruits(703), Beef(802) and salt (1003).
 Nearly 74% of the sum is spent on beef.
 Another house 0102003003000401 spends on 18% on beef while 19% on cooking
 oil (1001) and about 14% on buns cakes(110).
 We think about ranking in every district to see (however the data is quite
 sparse for some districts - only expenditure for 10 households is available
 for region 1 and district 2 for example).
 Top-spender of everything would automatically have the highest status.
 Notice that rank is determined by cost not by quantity - the difference
 of prices doesn't matter as long as rank in with a region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a need to aggregate quality.
 This needs to happen in the function.
 Right now what we're saying is that the consumer also improves quality
 - we don't really have a demand equation for it - nor have we written a
 utility function that has the quality aggregate in it.
 First, we must be sure about the utility function that is obtained in Deaton's
 example.
 He writes demand equation but there is no clear way to obtain the parameters
 of aggregation of quality.
 We may say that the quality for the group itself indicates status - but
 that doesn't help provide a utility function that budgets for status as
 well.
 What we're looking for is a utility function that depends on quantity as
 well as quality of the goods consumed.
 Let's assume a hunter (Atkinson) community that consumes just fruits and
 meat.
 If the utility function for an individual in the community is of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\boldsymbol{q})=f(u_{meat,quantity+quality}(q_{meat}),u_{fruits,quantity+quality}(q_{fruits}))$
\end_inset

, then we are claiming that the consumer doesn't have an aggregate quality
 amount allocated but instead has preallocated quality budgets for fruits
 and meat.
 The model we propose for quality is slightly different.
 We don't believe that quality concerns are separable.
 Since we consider that the difference in prices could indicate status as
 well as quality, it is likely that a consumer buying a better steak could
 imply buying cheaper fruits.
 For simplicity, we assume that quality utility can be expressed a linear
 sum i.e.
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{meat}\nu_{meat}+\alpha_{fruits}\nu_{fruits}$
\end_inset

.
 This doesn't change the form of the utility function and keeps the utility
 separable.
 This assumption also implies that a consumer has a bias that is insensitive
 to price i.e.
 a person who pays more attention to meat quality would continue to buy
 better quality meats even though the price have gone up.
 He models quality vector and claims that the keeping the price structure
 the same would allow us to give quality factor.
 The weak separability assumption offers 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{q}=g(E,\boldsymbol{p})=g(E/\lambda,\boldsymbol{p^{*}})$
\end_inset

 where 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{q}$
\end_inset


\series default
 is the quantity vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{p^{*}}$
\end_inset

is the price vector (how exactly does this follow? Would there be additional
 terms for aggregate quality).
 What we're claiming is that status overall is aggregated - and it's not
 separable i.e.
 status from meat is not separate from status from alcohol.
 In our model, consumer does reduce quality in response to price rise -
 but might keep the relative difference in prices also the same, so I would
 argue that consumer may switch to another process where there is some price
 difference.
 In this sense, the difference in prices (or the price structure) is always
 a factor for the consumer..
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rank vs Quantity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A person consuming higher automatically is ranked higher in consumption.
 Why should be then introduce rank when quantity already measures it (and
 is easier to represent).
 The reason we choose rank is because of its easier to determine within
 a context.
 A view on distribution of q within an area would provide the same ideas
 - ranking after all is also a function of q.
 If we keep the function of q as the generic representation of rank - then
 we can see this function as a mapping onto clusters.
 Let's take a world of three commodities A, B, C where n households buy
 what they need and can afford.
 A consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 buys 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i,A},q_{i,B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i,C}$
\end_inset

 where all of them can be 0.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\boldsymbol{q_{A}})$
\end_inset

 tells us which status cluster the consumer would belong to.
 One could consider the group function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\boldsymbol{q_{A}},\boldsymbol{q_{B},q_{C}})$
\end_inset

 that finds the status.
 This mapping could be utility itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We haven't actually addressed how a tree develops in this mapping.
 For any tree, we see what's at the top (root) of the tree.
 By considering a tree (which we could in just three commodity world just
 the same), we look what a consumer gets at the top.
 A tree is different from the sense it is seen in the regular theory - where
 food, entertainment, energy etc.
 are at the first level of the tree and each sub-tree contains others elements.
 In our case, we wish to combine utilities the same way - our claim being
 status aggregated from amongst components the same way.
 We also claim that status is not constituted in any other subtree i.e.
 nobody buys a status good for the sake of buying a status good - status
 is constituted in buying everything.
 Status is thus always implicitly from the sum-total of all items - except
 for jewelry and snob items that actually matter less and we care less about
 them when we observe the masses (particularly food items).
 In econometric work, the effect of rank should be limited to the cluster
 where the consumer resides i.e.
 the person at the top in the cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 might not worry about the consumer less in any cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $c'\ne c$
\end_inset

.
 This can change with communication (globalisation etc.
 and may require another model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our three commodity world, if the goods are all separable and additive
 - which means utilities other than status simply add up.
 However, the status utility is not separable and can be obtained from all
 items A, B and C (to varied levels).
 A correlation with the richer (higher permanent income) cluster can be
 a measure of how conspicuous the item is.
 But the degree of separation between ranking (distance between clusters)
 matters for status.
 We don't find anything else to matter at this point.
 From a general point of view, only the supply side concerns can tell us
 whether clustering has significance or not.
 It may be that the rich don't eat potatoes so a class X eating more potatoes
 than Y obviously does not mean that potatoes are a conspicuous good.
 We are careful not to use the fact that rich don't buy potatoes while the
 poor do (i.e.
 comment on conspicuous consumption using income elasticity to decide).
 Instead we only make the decision based on availability and price (
\begin_inset Formula $p-max(p_{i})$
\end_inset

 or a similar criteria that measures the price).
 The distribution of prices doesn't tell about the availability- except
 if we infer availability from variation of observed market prices with
 respect to region.
 For commodities A,B and C, if our tree had the root being food with the
 only first level nodes being starch, protein 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These are less of an instance of nutritional categories than one where categorie
s are based on food habits i.e.
 food items with both protein and carbs in them don't pose a classification
 problem as long as the consumers are able to classify them either as protein
 or carbohydrates.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Except when buying snob items, a consumer doesn't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

need
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 conspicuous consumption except through the relative differences with respect
 to other consumers.
 Let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\epsilon protein$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C\epsilon starch$
\end_inset

.
 Then there is no scope for conspicuous consumption within C.
 Since we assume protein and carb utilities to be separable and we also
 assume that no consumer goes to purchase anything conspicuous - status
 is inferred from the availability of other options.
 Now one of A or B would be pricier than the other.
 A crude measure of our status criterion is the dispersion in price (
\begin_inset Formula $p-max(p)$
\end_inset

) - where max is taken over all the products in the category.
 While this could be improved - it marks a higher priced commodity of with
 a higher status measure.
 If we were to infer the status of consumers based on the quantities they
 choose for A,B,C, then there are a few questions to be answered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does spending more on item C(which has no differentiation) have any influence
 on status? Yes, because more spending should still mean a statement of
 excess.
 However, if for two consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

, the quantities consumed for A,B, are lower for 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 and higher for C, then we would think that the status must be higher for
 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 (because the unidirectional nature of high price consumption
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A consumer who can buy more of an expensive item can definitely buy more
 of the cheaper item - but not the other way.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Having already counted for the effect of price and the substitution through
 slutsky equation
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We already know that i) if A,B are more expensive than C, then the consumer
 can't buy A,B as easily as she can C (income effect) and ii) A, B can be
 substituted with each other based on their price or preference ( we assume
 that very few consumers would be substituting A with C or B with C).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 , we must add the status utility to the the final utility - in order to
 have a fuller interpretation of quantities consumed.
 Notice that the smoothening of status differences (i.e.mapping of consumed
 quantities onto observed status classes) is a property of the status utility
 function and does not interfere with the regular utility.
 Obviously, you can choose to show much rice you have at the party - but
 it won't be the same as having 5 different meats (or alcohols) at the party.
 Variety and price differences between them is more crucial to status utility
 than quantity alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does it matter whether C is publicly viewed or not? No, it is hard to be
 imagine that different items in the same functional category have different
 visibility except what is expressed through price.
 In other words, the market prices the visibility so the price variation
 category is sufficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Where does availability fit in? Availability actually matters throughout.
 It is not trivial to talk about status advantages of an item that is available
 in an area compared to where it isn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Utility function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're given quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{q_{i}}$
\end_inset

 for every consumer, which is a vector of quantities for items 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{i}=\{i_{1},i_{2}..i_{m}\}$
\end_inset

.
 We can back out or insert the recorded prices wherever possible - but as
 such we don't need to use the price anywhere at all.
 If our utility function depends on quantities of items consumed and we
 don't want to study the change in preference of items as prices change,
 then it is sufficient to use commodity types as the only proxy of prices.
 For example, if we're not interested in the question whether more expensive
 food items would cause a decline in the spending on a wedding then our
 analysis doesn't need to have the price of foods and the whole analysis
 can depend on the expenditures and quantities alone.
 Expenditure allows us to understand income effects and quantities allow
 us to talk about felicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $u=\Pi(q-\gamma_{i})^{\beta_{i}}$
\end_inset

 is the linear expenditure utility function.
 We can use a more PIGLOG models for cost function (and estimate simply
 using a regression).
 We need grouping only for the sake of aggregation of conspicuous goods.
 We have therefore two claims for our convenience i) there is a two-state
 budgeting ii) consumers get rewarded more by choosing higher priced items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $u_{food}=f(g_{protein}(x,p),g_{carbs}(x,p),g_{fat}(x,p),g_{vegetables}(x,p),g_{fruits}(x,p))$
\end_inset

.
 We have been warned that luxuries and necessities can't go together in
 this setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental question is - do we really need to group the tree.
 The rationale we had was just that conspicuous items are possible to be
 had in every category.
 In the complete utility function, we'll have new categories that are more
 directly conspicuous (e.g.
 electronics), but looking at food alone, we can only observe conspicuous
 consumption in food
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If individuals spend proportionately less on expensive food items when they
 have electricity that should be evident from analysis.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Groups let us understand the group elasticity but other than that they
 have no particular use.
 If we're only interested in measuring total conspicuous utility, we can
 as well do it while keeping all elements separate and setting up a utility
 function just so that expensive items reward more to the consumer (i.e.
 she gets higher utility with the expensive item).
 The group elasticity may help us explain how are the groups affected because
 of conspicuous consumption - for example - if we split all groups into
 of status and non-status value: 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{food}=f(g_{protein\_status}(x,p),g_{protein\_non\_status}(x,p),g_{carbs\_status}(x,p),g_{carbs\_nonstatus}(x,p),g_{fat\_status}(x,p),g_{fat\_nonstatus}(x,p),g_{vegetables\_status}(x,p),g_{vegetables\_nonstatus}(x,p),g_{fruits\_status}(x,p),g_{fruits\_nonstatus}(x,p))$
\end_inset

.
 In absence of groups, our utility function would just look like as.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=f(q_{beef})f(q_{rice})...\times s(protein)\times s(carb)\times s(fat)\times s(fruits)\times s(vegetables)$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $s(c)=f(p_{i}-p_{c})$
\end_inset

.
 Let's observe this with a three-good example.
 The utility function can be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{food}=f_{1}(q_{A},q_{B})f_{2}(q_{C})f_{1,s}(q_{A},q_{B})f_{2,s}(q_{C})$
\end_inset

 or of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{food}=h(q_{A})h(q_{B})h(q_{C})s(q_{A})s(q_{B})s(q_{C})$
\end_inset

.
 The former method utility function allows us to talk about elasticity of
 a category whereas the latter only tells us about the elasticity of a good.
 The criteria of fit is the only way to ensure that price differences actually
 explain the expenditure better.
 For starting out, we could just have 
\begin_inset Formula $u=U(f(x_{AB}),g(x_{C}))$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more thorough comparison of utility functions may be possible once a linear
 expenditure system is fitted on to the consumption data.
 Using the Marshallian demand function for utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\Pi(q_{k}-\gamma_{k})^{\beta_{k}}$
\end_inset

(where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\beta_{k}=1)$
\end_inset

.
 the Marshallian demand function is 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}=\gamma_{k}+\frac{\beta_{k}}{p_{k}}(x-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum p_{j}q_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we observe expenditures (instead of prices) in the data, we could
 use 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=\frac{e_{i}}{q_{i}}$
\end_inset

 in the demand function.
 Linear expenditure system would not provide a reasonable estimate of substitute
s vs complements - but it may still be worthwhile to repeat Stone's analysis.
 Using a price index in the time series that has been used by Deaton et
 al.
 can help ignore the regional variations in prices - but we do use price
 as a function of region for now (particularly because of the sparsity of
 data).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}=\gamma_{k}+\frac{\beta_{k}}{p_{k}}(x-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j})\Rightarrow p_{k}q_{k}=p_{k}\gamma_{k}+\beta_{k}(x-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j})\Rightarrow w_{k}=\frac{p_{k}\gamma_{k}-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j}}{x}+\beta_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 So for adding up: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum w_{k}=1\Rightarrow\sum\beta_{k}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Concavity means 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,\theta p_{A}+(1-\theta)p_{B})\ge\theta c(u,p_{A})+(1-\theta)c(u,p_{B})$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1$
\end_inset

 vectors, then the cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p)$
\end_inset

 for linear budget constraint can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p)=\sum p_{k}\gamma_{k}+u\Pi p_{k}^{\beta_{k}}=p'\gamma+ue^{\beta'ln\ p}$
\end_inset

.
 So the condition implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta p_{A}'\cdot\gamma+(1-\theta)p'_{B}\cdot\gamma+ue^{\beta ln(\theta p_{A}'+(1-\theta)p'_{B})}\ge\theta p'_{A}\cdot\gamma+\theta ue^{\beta'\ lnp_{A}}+(1-\theta)p'_{B}\cdot\gamma+(1-\theta)ue^{\beta'lnp_{B}}\Rightarrow e^{\beta ln(\theta p_{A}'+(1-\theta)p'_{B})}\ge\theta e^{\beta'\ lnp_{A}}+(1-\theta)e^{\beta'lnp_{B}}\Rightarrow\Pi(\theta p_{A,k}+(1-\theta)p_{B,k})^{\beta_{k}}\ge\theta\Pi p_{A,k}^{\beta_{k}}+(1-\theta)\Pi p_{B,k}^{\beta_{k}}$
\end_inset

 .
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=.5$
\end_inset

 then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi(p_{A,k}+p_{B,k})^{\beta_{k}}\ge\Pi p_{A,k}^{\beta_{k}}+\Pi p_{B,k}^{\beta_{k}}$
\end_inset

.
 With two goods, this would simplify to 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{A,1}+p_{B,1})^{a}(p_{A,2}+p_{B,2})^{1-a}\ge p_{A,1}^{a}p_{A,2}^{1-a}+p_{B,1}^{a}p_{B,2}^{1-a}$
\end_inset

 (if 
\begin_inset Formula $a=.5$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{1}+b_{1})^{1/2}(a_{2}+b_{2})^{1/2}\ge(a_{1}a_{2})^{1/2}+(b_{1}b_{2})^{1/2}\Rightarrow(a_{1}+b_{1})(a_{2}+b_{2})=a_{1}a_{2}+a_{1}b_{2}+a_{2}b_{1}+b_{1}b_{2}\ge a_{1}a_{2}+b_{1}b_{2}+2\sqrt{a_{1}a_{2}b_{1}b_{2}}\Rightarrow(a_{1}b_{2}+a_{2}b_{1})^{2}\ge4a_{1}a_{2}b_{1}b_{2}\Rightarrow(a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1})^{2}\ge0$
\end_inset

Another check is that the Hessian of the cost function is negative semi-definite.
 This is not as straightforward - the gradient being :
\begin_inset Formula

A numerical approach may be to optimise utility programmatically (instead
 of through first-order conditions).
 This can be explored with multi-objective optimisation packages.

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x_{i},p)$

\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}(X=[\boldsymbol{k},q_{i}])=|[0,0,..,n_{k}\ times,1,1,1..i\ times]\times[\boldsymbol{k},q_{i}]\cdot[0_{k},p_{i}]-p_{i}\cdot q_{obs}|=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|q_{i}-q_{obs,i}|<\delta$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is optimisation tolerance.
 Notice that there are no constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{k}$
\end_inset

 as such.
 The homogeneity constraint and the constraints arising out of preferences
 can be further imposed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimating Linear Expenditure Utility Model with OLS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regression equation is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
p_{k}q_{k} & =p_{k}\gamma_{k}+\beta_{k}(x-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j})\label{eq:regression_linexp_gamma}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:regression_linexp_gamma"

\end_inset

 can also be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
p_{k}q_{k} & =p_{k}(\gamma_{k}-\beta_{k})+\beta_{k}x-\beta_{k}\sum_{j\ne k}p_{j}\gamma_{j}=\begin{array}{cccccc}
[(-\beta_{k}\gamma_{1}) & ... & (\gamma_{k}-\beta_{k}) & ... & (-\beta_{k}\gamma_{m}) & \beta_{k}]\times\end{array}[\begin{array}{c}
p_{1}\\
...\\
p_{k}\\
...\\
p_{m}\\
x
\end{array}]
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

 If we were to imposed no restriction on 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k},\gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

, then the regional prices turn out to multicollinear.
 Also, since the cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p)=\sum p_{k}\gamma_{k}+u\Pi p_{k}^{\beta_{k}}$
\end_inset

is concave only when when 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}\ge\gamma_{i}\forall i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}\ge0\forall i$
\end_inset

.
 We can only guarantee 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}\ge0\forall i$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, we impose the further constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}=0\forall i$
\end_inset

.
 The equation we can estimate would thus become 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
p_{k}q_{k} & =\alpha_{k}+\beta_{k}x+\epsilon\label{eq:regression_linexp}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This corresponds to the simplified utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\Pi q_{k}^{\beta_{k}}:\sum_{k}\beta_{k}=1$
\end_inset

 (which takes care of the adding up constraint).
 The OLS estimation of Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:regression_linexp"

\end_inset

 in the table has not met the adding up constraint.
 The idea of luxuries and inferior goods also don't make sense in the linear
 expenditure model because there can be no inferior goods (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}<0)$
\end_inset

 for concavity of the cost function.
