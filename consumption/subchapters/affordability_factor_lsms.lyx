Determining Status ranking from the LSMS data in Tanzania
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LSMS survey records neither the price nor the quantity consumed for
 any non-food quantities.
 Instead of differences in prices (which are unavailable), we test whether
 differences in per-head consumption in the population within a region could
 represent the variants of different prices which can be used to calculated
 the affordability factor (i.e.
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}-max(p_{k})$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This exercise is neither trivial and not fully reliable at this point -
 but an effort to detect the variants of the same item or group of items
 with different prices in the market.
 In the absence of price data, we hope to use some knowledge of the supply
 side to improve our interpretation of price from average cost data.
 We begin with identifying clusters in the per head consumption cost after
 accounting for control variables related to usage of the item e.g.
 more per-head electricity costs should be scaled with number of appliances
 the household may have (which is available in data).
 In absence of prices, this ad-hoc test needs to be performed on a case-by-case
 basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The significance of control variables denoting the usage of related assets
 owned by the consumer and the lack of any clustering (in average consumption
 scaled by usage) would imply that the status is indicated by the asset
 ownership instead (and thus the average consumption consumption doesn't
 need to be counted for the status impact).
 For example, since per-head electricity cost is higher for those with electroni
c equipment - we would conclude that consumer raises her ranking by owning
 electronic equipment and having electricity - rather than by choosing a
 higher price option for electricity.
 We thus ignore the consumption of electricity for testing of signaling
 quantities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If clusters of prices are observed after scaling (regression) with the usage
 variable, we use the cluster prices as input to our affordability factor
 calculation.
 As a sanity check, we may also verify the factors that may influence the
 choice of a higher price item - e.g.
 with a probit on the dummy of cluster's average-consumption being above
 or below the cluster price threshold as the dependent variable and the
 total expenditure, housingstatus, education, relevant asset etc.
 as control variables.
 This however, is not the part of the methodology to detect price difference
 through average consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our eventual goal is to identify the price differences which the consumer
 observes to build her utility tree.
 These trees are are shown for Tanzania LSMS data in the Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tree1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tree2"

\end_inset

.
 The overall status from consumption of an individual consumer is simply
 the aggregation of affordability factor (or a similar metric) at the root
 of the tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking an example where this methodology might work, we consider the cost-per-he
ad for kerosene which varies a lot in dar-es-salaam (region 7)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We have assumed there are no secondary markets or hoarding for items in
 consideration
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We clearly cannot claim that the differences in consumption cost per head
 imply a price differentiation for kerosene - simply because availability
 of electricity in Dar-es-salaam can change the usage of kerosene in the
 household (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ElectricityvsKeroseneCosts"

\end_inset

).
 What we can do for dar-es-salaam (or any region where electricity is also
 available) is to consider electricity and kerosene as the variants of energy
 level in tree and treat electricity as a higher price variant of the energy-sou
rce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all problems can be circumvented with such an aggregation either.
 One cannot for example, use per-head consumption costs to detect price
 differentiation for cigarettes - where the most significant factor affecting
 high consumption is simply be the addiction of the consumer - the data
 on which is not available in the survey.
 We are compelled to ignore smoking for our analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible that the asset itself - related to the consumed good
 whose average consumption we test for price-differentiation - has more
 variants of different prices than those of consumed good.
 For example, detergent that serves clothes may not be varied but the washing
 machine where detergents are used could be more nuanced.
 Unfortunately we do not have even the cost estimate on assets owned by
 the household - so we are left with ignoring this possibility at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most other non-food commodities, either aggregation and/or cluster-detection
 could help identify the price-differentiation.
 If we look at the per-head consumption cost on bar soap, there seem to
 be two cost clusters in region dar-es-salaam - the dummy of per-head-consumptio
n-cost <6000 (i.e.
 the cluster dummy) finds roomsnum, language and occupation all significant
 (total expenditure is not) i.e.
 those with a better-paying occupations and English-speaking abilities tend
 to spend disproportionately on bar-soap - this difference in consumption
 per-head costs could be used as the price-difference in our original sense.
 The similar cluster dummy for detergent is not found significant (except
 for roomsnum in dar-es-salaam ) - hence we ignore detergents for price-differen
tiation.
 It can't be denied that such inferences are ad-hoc and dependent on whether
 there are any assets that may justify higher per-head consumption cost
 or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our end-goal is to differentiate the status-impact of consumption from the
 status-impact of assets and then consider a combined status impact form
 assets and consumption - so we may fit the function for consumption from
 status goods into the intertemporal substitution problem.
 The relative assets-ownership ranking of consumers is an important part
 of this exercise.
 The LSMS data does not have even the cost information for assets owned,
 so we only consider the number of items owned for asset-ownership ranking
 of consumes i.e.
 if someone has more assets than another person who has less or none of
 the same asset, then all else being equal the former is invariably of higher
 status than the latter.
 Since our goal is to finally combine the asset-ranking and consumption
 ranking, we avoid double-counting the role of assets - since a lot of items
 are not consumed simply because the asset related to it is not owned by
 the consumer.

Comparing consumption across commodities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prices are recorded for a set of quantities.
 These quantities are nearly the same for (mls, litres, g, kgs, pieces)
 for both recorded prices and consumed quantities.
 However, not all food items are recorded - so we must rely on the inferred
 prices for the most part.
 In fact, if we were to filter out of all the items where price is not recorded
 (NA), we would be only left with about 500 households (for 2010).
 Such a filter is a very restrictive one and we choose to depend on recorded_pri
ce alone for premium - we use it for guided value wherever it is available.
 When multiple prices are recorded for the same quantity (or for a different
 quantity) - we choose the recorded_price that is closest to the inferred
 price.
 The matching is never done on quantities - only on prices.
 Across all regions only the following items have multiple prices recorded
 - Peas/Lentils - 401 , Onions-tomatoes 601, Millet-grain 106, Spinach 602
 , Seafood 808, Bread 109, Local brews 107, Yams 204, Cassava-flour 202
 Fruits 703.
 Staying close to the recorded price ensures that we only have slight measuremen
t errors in our technique and an double-evidence for clustering in prices.
 Unfortunately market prices are not recorded for all region codes in the
 survey.
 Even if prices were recorded on a ward or district level (ignoring the
 ea level) prices recorded are still quite rare.
 Only about 30% of the total purchases can be matched up with recorded -
 prices.
 Of those where prices can be matched, about 15% of the inferred-prices
 deviate more than 50% from the closest recorded price.
 We could think of matching with the price-quantity relatonship but the
 market prices are not rich enough for that.
 Where multiple prices are recorded they indicate the variety of items rather
 than the different quantities.
 Following prices for cassava/dry flour indicate the difference between
 cassava and its dry flour in the market.
 The disparity in prices justifies the price-matching.
 Unfortunately, there are quite some errors in recorded market price - such
 as prices being far lower by a magnitude (e.g.

 has less than 10th of the price).
 The evidence of items with multiples prices aggregated in one category
 (e.g.
 in cassava dry/flour or onions/tomatoes category) necessitates that we
 view the different items as of same conspicuous value.

The use of market-recorded prices are to adjust the effective of region
 on prices.
 We observe that a some prices can be very skewed (local brews 107).
 Some data is clearly bad (e.g.
 for eggs, canned milk).
 Chicken seems highly skewed.
 Taken over all regions, the highest kurtosis (not much difference in prices)
 is observed for charcoal (207), milling-grain fees(208), Maize-flour(105),
 Sugar(301), Salt(1003), Fruits (703) , Beef(802), Eggs(807).
 Less kurtosis (diffusion) is in Millet-grain(106), Bread(109), Irish potatoes(2
05), Coconuts (502), Onions-tomatoes (601) - different items, Spinach(602),
 Dry-tea(1101).
 Next are Kerosene (201), Maize cob (103), Cassava (201), Plantains (206),
 Groundnuts (501), Chicken (804), Local Brews (1107).
 Still lower kurtosis (higher differences) are in Sweet potatoes (203),
 Bananas (701), Citric Fruits (702), Fish-Seafood (808), Milk(901), Cooking
 oil (1001).
 Lowest kurtosis is found husked rice (102), MaizeGrain (104), Millet-Flour(107)
, Cassava-dryflour (202), Yams/cocoyams(204) (two varieties), Peas/lentils(401),
 Goat meat (801).

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to back out the prices from expenditure, then we must ensure
 that the expenditure recorded is accurate.
 Unfortunately, there are many outliers in the data.
 Sometimes, only one person in a district is recorded.
 This magnifies the effect of the outlier observation on the price.
 The aggregation of prices can only be done at region level for that purpose.

The tree of commodities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once prices are cleaned (outlying priced purchases removed), then we can
 aggregate the relative prices at every state of purchase in the tree.
 The relative price was supposed to be distribution of items.
 One particular house 0102003003016101 for example, spends on sugar (301),
 Onions/tomatoes(601), Fruits(703), Beef(802) and salt (1003).
 Nearly 74% of the sum is spent on beef.
 Another house 0102003003000401 spends on 18% on beef while 19% on cooking
 oil (1001) and about 14% on buns cakes(110).
 We think about ranking in every district to see (however the data is quite
 sparse for some districts - only expenditure for 10 households is available
 for region 1 and district 2 for example).
 Top-spender of everything would automatically have the highest status.
 Notice that rank is determined by cost not by quantity - the difference
 of prices doesn't matter as long as rank in with a region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rank vs Quantity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A person consuming higher automatically is ranked higher in consumption.
 Why should be then introduce rank when quantity already measures it (and
 is easier to represent).
 The reason we choose rank is because of its easier to determine within
 a context.
 A view on distribution of q within an area would provide the same ideas
 - ranking after all is also a function of q.
 If we keep the function of q as the generic representation of rank - then
 we can see this function as a mapping onto clusters.
 Let's take a world of three commodities A, B, C where n households buy
 what they need and can afford.
 A consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 buys 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i,A},q_{i,B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i,C}$
\end_inset

 where all of them can be 0.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\boldsymbol{q_{A}})$
\end_inset

 tells us which status cluster the consumer would belong to.
 One could consider the group function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\boldsymbol{q_{A}},\boldsymbol{q_{B},q_{C}})$
\end_inset

 that finds the status.
 This mapping could be utility itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We haven't actually addressed how a tree develops in this mapping.
 For any tree, we see what's at the top (root) of the tree.
 By considering a tree (which we could in just three commodity world just
 the same), we look what a consumer gets at the top.
 A tree is different from the sense it is seen in the regular theory - where
 food, entertainment, energy etc.
 are at the first level of the tree and each sub-tree contains others elements.
 In our case, we wish to combine utilities the same way - our claim being
 status aggregated from amongst components the same way.
 We also claim that status is not constituted in any other subtree i.e.
 nobody buys a status good for the sake of buying a status good - status
 is constituted in buying everything.
 Status is thus always implicitly from the sum-total of all items - except
 for jewelry and snob items that actually matter less and we care less about
 them when we observe the masses (particularly food items).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So in our three commodity world, if the goods are all separable and additive
 - which means utilities other than status simply add up.
 However, the status utility is not separable and can be obtained from all
 items A, B and C (to varied levels).
 A correlation with the richer (higher permanent income) cluster can be
 a measure of how conspicuous the item is.
 But the degree of separation between ranking (distance between clusters)
 matters for status.
 We don't find anything else to matter at this point.
 From a general point of view, only the supply side concerns can tell us
 whether clustering has significance or not.
 It may be that the rich don't eat potatoes so a class X eating more potatoes
 than Y obviously does not mean that potatoes are a conspicuous good.
 Notice that we don't use the fact that rich don't buy potatoes while the
 poor do (using income elasticity to decide).
 Instead we only make the decision based on availability and price (
\begin_inset Formula $p-max(p_{i})$
\end_inset

 would actually measure the price).
 The distribution of prices doesn't tell about the availability- except
 if we infer availability from variation of observed market prices with
 respect to region.
 For commodities A,B and C, if our tree had the root being food with the
 only first level nodes being starch, protein 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These are less of an instance of nutritional categories than one where categorie
s are based on food habits i.e.
 food items with both protein and carbs in them don't pose a classification
 problem as long as the consumers are able to classify them either as protein
 or carbohydrates.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Except when buying snob items, a consumer doesn't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

need
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 conspicuous consumption except through the relative differences with respect
 to other consumers.
 Let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\epsilon protein$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C\epsilon starch$
\end_inset

.
 Then there is no scope for conspicuous consumption within C.
 Since we assume protein and carb utilities to be separable and we also
 assume that no consumer goes to purchase anything conspicuous - status
 is inferred from the availability of other options.
 Now one of A or B would be pricier than the other.
 A crude measure of our status criterion is the dispersion in price (
\begin_inset Formula $p-max(p)$
\end_inset

) - where max is taken over all the products in the category.
 While this could be improved - it marks a higher priced commodity of with
 a higher status measure.
 If we were to infer the status of consumers based on the quantities they
 choose for A,B,C, then there are a few questions to be answered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does spending more on item C(which has no differentiation) have any influence
 on status? Yes, because more spending should still mean a statement of
 excess.
 However, if for two consumers 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

, the quantities consumed for A,B, are lower for 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 with respective to 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 and higher for C, then we would think that the status must be higher for
 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{2}$
\end_inset

 (because the unidirectional nature of high price consumption
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A consumer who can buy more of an expensive item can definitely buy more
 of the cheaper item - but not the other way.
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Having already counted for the effect of price and the substitution through
 slutsky equation
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We already know that i) if A,B are more expensive than C, then the consumer
 can't buy A,B as easily as she can C (income effect) and ii) A, B can be
 substituted with each other based on their price or preference ( we assume
 that very few consumers would be substituting A with C or B with C).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 , we must add the status utility to the the final utility - in order to
 have a fuller interpretation of quantities consumed.
 Notice that the smoothening of status differences (i.e.mapping of consumed
 quantities onto observed status classes) is a property of the status utility
 function and does not interfere with the regular utility.
 Obviously, you can choose to show much rice you have at the party - but
 it won't be the same as having 5 different meats (or alcohols) at the party.
 Variety and price differences between them is more crucial to status utility
 than quantity alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does it matter whether C is publicly viewed or not? No, it is hard to be
 imagine that different items in the same functional category have different
 visibility except what is expressed through price.
 In other words, the market prices the visibility so the price variation
 category is sufficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Where does availability fit in? Availability actually matters throughout.
 It is not trivial to talk about status advantages of an item that is available
 in an area compared to where it isn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Utility function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're given quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{q_{i}}$
\end_inset

 for every consumer, which is a vector of quantities for items 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{i}=\{i_{1},i_{2}..i_{m}\}$
\end_inset

.
 We can back out or insert the recorded prices wherever possible - but as
 such we don't need to use the price anywhere at all.
 If our utility function depends on quantities of items consumed and we
 don't want to study the change in preference of items as prices change,
 then it is sufficient to use commodity types as the only proxy of prices.
 For example, if we're not interested in the question whether more expensive
 food items would cause a decline in the spending on a wedding then our
 analysis doesn't need to have the price of foods and the whole analysis
 can depend on the expenditures and quantities alone.
 Expenditure allows us to understand income effects and quantities allow
 us to talk about felicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $u=\Pi(q-\gamma_{i})^{\beta_{i}}$
\end_inset

 is the linear expenditure utility function.
 We can use a more PIGLOG models for cost function (and estimate simply
 using a regression).
 We need grouping only for the sake of aggregation of conspicuous goods.
 We have therefore two claims for our convenience i) there is a two-state
 budgeting ii) consumers get rewarded more by choosing higher priced items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $u_{food}=f(g_{protein}(x,p),g_{carbs}(x,p),g_{fat}(x,p),g_{vegetables}(x,p),g_{fruits}(x,p))$
\end_inset

.
 We have been warned that luxuries and necessities can't go together in
 this setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental question is - do we really need to group the tree.
 The rationale we had was just that conspicuous items are possible to be
 had in every category.
 In the complete utility function, we'll have new categories that are more
 directly conspicuous (e.g.
 electronics), but looking at food alone, we can only observe conspicuous
 consumption in food
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If individuals spend proportionately less on expensive food items when they
 have electricity that should be evident from analysis.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Groups let us understand the group elasticity but other than that they
 have no particular use.
 If we're only interested in measuring total conspicuous utility, we can
 as well do it while keeping all elements separate and setting up a utility
 function just so that expensive items reward more to the consumer (i.e.
 she gets higher utility with the expensive item).
 The group elasticity may help us explain how are the groups affected because
 of conspicuous consumption - for example - if we split all groups into
 of status and non-status value: 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{food}=f(g_{protein\_status}(x,p),g_{protein\_non\_status}(x,p),g_{carbs\_status}(x,p),g_{carbs\_nonstatus}(x,p),g_{fat\_status}(x,p),g_{fat\_nonstatus}(x,p),g_{vegetables\_status}(x,p),g_{vegetables\_nonstatus}(x,p),g_{fruits\_status}(x,p),g_{fruits\_nonstatus}(x,p))$
\end_inset

.
 In absence of groups, our utility function would just look like as.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u=f(q_{beef})f(q_{rice})...\times s(protein)\times s(carb)\times s(fat)\times s(fruits)\times s(vegetables)$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $s(c)=f(p_{i}-p_{c})$
\end_inset

.
 Let's observe this with a three-good example.
 The utility function can be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{food}=f_{1}(q_{A},q_{B})f_{2}(q_{C})f_{1,s}(q_{A},q_{B})f_{2,s}(q_{C})$
\end_inset

 or of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{food}=h(q_{A})h(q_{B})h(q_{C})s(q_{A})s(q_{B})s(q_{C})$
\end_inset

.
 The former method utility function allows us to talk about elasticity of
 a category whereas the latter only tells us about the elasticity of a good.
 The criteria of fit is the only way to ensure that price differences actually
 explain the expenditure better.
 For starting out, we could just have 
\begin_inset Formula $u=U(f(x_{AB}),g(x_{C}))$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more thorough comparison of utility functions may be possible once a linear
 expenditure system is fitted on to the consumption data.
 Using the Marshallian demand function for utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\Pi(q_{k}-\gamma_{k})^{\beta_{k}}$
\end_inset

(where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\beta_{k}=1)$
\end_inset

.
 the Marshallian demand function is 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}=\gamma_{k}+\frac{\beta_{k}}{p_{k}}(x-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum p_{j}q_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we observe expenditures (instead of prices) in the data, we could
 use 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=\frac{e_{i}}{q_{i}}$
\end_inset

 in the demand function.
 Linear expenditure system would not provide a reasonable estimate of substitute
s vs complements - but it may still be worthwhile to repeat Stone's analysis.
 Using a price index in the time series that has been used by Deaton et
 al.
 can help ignore the regional variations in prices - but we do use price
 as a function of region for now (particularly because of the sparsity of
 data).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}=\gamma_{k}+\frac{\beta_{k}}{p_{k}}(x-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j})\Rightarrow p_{k}q_{k}=p_{k}\gamma_{k}+\beta_{k}(x-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j})\Rightarrow w_{k}=\frac{p_{k}\gamma_{k}-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j}}{x}+\beta_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 So for adding up: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum w_{k}=1\Rightarrow\sum\beta_{k}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Concavity means 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,\theta p_{A}+(1-\theta)p_{B})\ge\theta c(u,p_{A})+(1-\theta)c(u,p_{B})$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1$
\end_inset

 vectors, then the cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p)$
\end_inset

 for linear budget constraint can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p)=\sum p_{k}\gamma_{k}+u\Pi p_{k}^{\beta_{k}}=p'\gamma+ue^{\beta'ln\ p}$
\end_inset

.
 So the condition implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta p_{A}'\cdot\gamma+(1-\theta)p'_{B}\cdot\gamma+ue^{\beta ln(\theta p_{A}'+(1-\theta)p'_{B})}\ge\theta p'_{A}\cdot\gamma+\theta ue^{\beta'\ lnp_{A}}+(1-\theta)p'_{B}\cdot\gamma+(1-\theta)ue^{\beta'lnp_{B}}\Rightarrow e^{\beta ln(\theta p_{A}'+(1-\theta)p'_{B})}\ge\theta e^{\beta'\ lnp_{A}}+(1-\theta)e^{\beta'lnp_{B}}\Rightarrow\Pi(\theta p_{A,k}+(1-\theta)p_{B,k})^{\beta_{k}}\ge\theta\Pi p_{A,k}^{\beta_{k}}+(1-\theta)\Pi p_{B,k}^{\beta_{k}}$
\end_inset

 .
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=.5$
\end_inset

 then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi(p_{A,k}+p_{B,k})^{\beta_{k}}\ge\Pi p_{A,k}^{\beta_{k}}+\Pi p_{B,k}^{\beta_{k}}$
\end_inset

.
 With two goods, this would simplify to 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{A,1}+p_{B,1})^{a}(p_{A,2}+p_{B,2})^{1-a}\ge p_{A,1}^{a}p_{A,2}^{1-a}+p_{B,1}^{a}p_{B,2}^{1-a}$
\end_inset

 (if 
\begin_inset Formula $a=.5$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{1}+b_{1})^{1/2}(a_{2}+b_{2})^{1/2}\ge(a_{1}a_{2})^{1/2}+(b_{1}b_{2})^{1/2}\Rightarrow(a_{1}+b_{1})(a_{2}+b_{2})=a_{1}a_{2}+a_{1}b_{2}+a_{2}b_{1}+b_{1}b_{2}\ge a_{1}a_{2}+b_{1}b_{2}+2\sqrt{a_{1}a_{2}b_{1}b_{2}}\Rightarrow(a_{1}b_{2}+a_{2}b_{1})^{2}\ge4a_{1}a_{2}b_{1}b_{2}\Rightarrow(a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1})^{2}\ge0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another check is that the Hessian of the cost function is negative semi-definite.
 This is not as straightforward - the gradient being :
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
\begin{array}{ccc}
[p_{1}\gamma_{1}+u\beta_{1}p_{1}^{\beta_{1}-1}\Pi_{j}^{j\ne1}p_{j}^{\beta_{j}} & p_{2}\gamma_{2}+u\beta_{2}p_{2}^{\beta_{2}-1}\Pi_{j}^{j\ne2}p_{j}^{\beta_{j}} & ...\end{array} & ]
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

 The second derivative is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
[\begin{array}{ccc}
\gamma_{1}+u\beta_{1}(\beta_{1}-1)p_{1}^{\beta_{1}-2}\Pi_{j}^{j\ne1}p_{j}^{\beta_{j}} & ... & ...\\
u\beta_{2}\beta_{1}p_{1}^{\beta_{1}-1}p_{2}^{\beta_{2}-1}\Pi_{j}^{j\ne1,2}p_{j}^{\beta_{j}} & ... & ...\\
.. & ... & ...
\end{array} & ]
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A numerical approach may be to optimise utility programmatically (instead
 of through first-order conditions).
 This can be explored with multi-objective optimisation packages.
 As such the problem is to optimise the error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i}(g(x_{i},p)-q_{obs,i})^{2}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x_{i},p)$
\end_inset

 is the Marshallian demand function and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the observed quantity consumed for consumer 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 The steps are maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x,p)$
\end_inset

 by varying 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{k,q_{i}}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

make sure 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is not too far from observed 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{obs}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be formulated as maximising 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(X=[\boldsymbol{k},q_{i}])$
\end_inset

 subject to 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}(X=[\boldsymbol{k},q_{i}])=|[0,0,..,n_{k}\ times,1,1,1..i\ times]\times[\boldsymbol{k},q_{i}]\cdot[0_{k},p_{i}]-p_{i}\cdot q_{obs}|=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|q_{i}-q_{obs,i}|<\delta$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is optimisation tolerance.
 Notice that there are no constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{k}$
\end_inset

 as such.
 The homogeneity constraint and the constraints arising out of preferences
 can be further imposed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimating Linear Expenditure Utility Model with OLS

The regression equation is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
p_{k}q_{k} & =p_{k}\gamma_{k}+\beta_{k}(x-\sum p_{j}\gamma_{j})\label{eq:regression_linexp_gamma}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset

If we were to imposed no restriction on 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k},\gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

, then the estimation would have the results.
 Since the cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u,p)=\sum p_{k}\gamma_{k}+u\Pi p_{k}^{\beta_{k}}$
\end_inset

is concave only when when 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}\ge\gamma_{i}\forall i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}\ge0\forall i$
\end_inset

.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}\ge0$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}\ge0\forall i$
\end_inset

.
 The equation we can estimate would thus be 
\begin_inset Formula
