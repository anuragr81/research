 authored by Thorstein Veblen in 1899.
 At about the same time when Marx endorsed the view of all commodities as

 psychological basis for consumption among the economic classes.
 His view of conspicuous consumption may at times appear critical of the

Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods

 of commodities.
 While he observes the tendency amongst the elite to distance themselves
 from physical labour - he argues that this tendency has transformed itself
 into a desire of displaying exploits and has survived in culture from more
 primitive hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies.
 This symbolism is inherent in all exchange of goods and services (including

Many studies related to conspicuous consumption have relied on a visibility
 survey - which quantifies the lot of complex interactions in what may constitut
e status competitions in a society.
 A luxury item - for example - needs to be marketed as a luxury for it to
 both impart visible signals to others and to improve self-perception of
 the buyer.
 In Veblen's original framework, for a product to indicate status it must
 be rare and superfluous (thus serve as an exploit).
 That a watch is more noticeable than an insurance policy (and associated
 with higher income) is not entirely relevant to this framework.
 Moreover, whether a poor person buying a cheap watch and a richer person
 buying a watch that is far more expensive (and probably subject to import
 restrictions) are both instances of conspicuous consumption or not depends
 on the context that the observer chooses.
 Cheap watches may or may not constitute conspicuous consumption - depending
 on the social welfare function.
 The wide variety of criteria in conspicuous consumption seem to indicate
 this ambiguity (See Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In both the developed and developing worlds, conspicuous consumption is
 driven by perceived scarcity and competition (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 If status were imparted by inherited wealth alone, there would be little
 conspicuous consumption as the consumers would be quick to realise the
 futility of buying trinkets.
 In the developed world, where markets have evolved to address the demands
 of the population, the positional pressures are readily addressed by market
 forces - thus a preference for visible goods indicates a higher price on
 them and a higher consumption on visible products always 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

signals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a higher status (a product with a higher status symbol would automatically
 carry a higher price).
 In underdeveloped markets, where information asymmetries are abound, the
 higher signalling (for conspicuous consumption) would not necessarily be
 achieved with higher spending on visible goods - and other factors (e.g.
 social standing, asset ownership, social networks and education) start
 to matter in the combined utility function - as is suggested by data from
 various cross-section expenditure surveys.
 These other mechanisms of signaling - although not part of purchases -
 fall under Veblen's view of conspicuous consumption.

\begin_layout Description
\paragraph_spacing single
Scarcity - A term used by Fred Hirsch in a theory to explain distribution
 of resources in a society.
 Scarcity is the perceived or real lack of products or services created
 by a competition for them which is intensified by population growth ( through
 increased productivity and time costs).
 Scarcities can be either direct or indirect and thus - physical or social.
 Hirsch also points out that social scarcities are becoming physical scarcities
 (so this distinction isn't so clear after all).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
\paragraph_spacing single
Congestion - The competition for resources in the context of modern Western
 society where physical scarcities (severe shortages of food and shelter)
 have been largely conquered.
 In Hirsch's theory, congestion is a side-effect of commercialization and
 removal of older social barriers.
 Since all goods and amenities are available through money, the competition
 and scarcity for what used to be accessible to only the top few have intensifie
d.
 With economic progress therefore, consumers are more - not less - driven
 by status needs than before.
 Not surprisingly, writing of the gilded age affluence in the United States,
 Veblen had discussed the same phenomenon that had revived the need for
 status signaling.

 congestion.

Signaling - The mechanism that consumers use to indicate status in society
 - a concept strongly tied to the idea of indicating status through purchasing

The most generic term for status-related consumption provided by Thorstein

).
 It encompasses not just goods available for purchase in the market (that
 are bought by consumers to improve their perceived status) - but also the
 barriers that may indicate status through rareness.
 Veblen's was a rather unconventional attempt to link the social barriers
 with expenditure
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A robber baron, Veblen says, has a better chance of escaping the law than
 a small crook because “a well-bred expenditure of his booty especially
 appeals to persons of a cultivated sense of the proprieties and goes far
 to mitigate the sense of moral turpitude with which his dereliction is
 viewed by them.” Scholars do not ordinarily associate the disposal of ill-gotten
 wealth with good breeding (quoted from Galbraith 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "GalbraithEssential"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Veblen's focus had been the consumption patterns of the richer section
 of society and the way conspicuous consumption is understood is through
 to inference of status through continued search for expensive or rare items.
 Veblen provides a psychological framework to explain the competitions that
 have survived since barbaric times when insignia were used to indicate
 status.
 Status indication - as is noted in the study in the context of developing
 countries - can extend beyond the purchase of items in the market.

Economists have long explored relative prosperity as a determinant of personal
 happiness.
 A challenge to the rational expectations theory appears when despite being
 richer in absolute terms, a young adult in a poor urban neighborhood in
 the developed world may be unhappier than the elite in many developing
 countries.
 Discussing necessities in this context of relative poverty, Sen, for example,
 points out that the television is a need for the school education of a
 British child in a way it isn't for a Tanzanian child

 the extent that striving to achieve more than others is ingrained in our

Focusing primarily on post-war developments in the Western society, Fred
 Hirsch had given similar forewarning of the effects of intensifying status
 competitions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In modern society, Hirsch argued, the needs have expanded manifolds since
 the time when Adam Smith's invisible hand was known to work.
 In Europe of eighteenth century, the rich could pursue their interests
 while the poor gained mobility in exchange of their participation.
 Through immense success of capitalism by the twentieth century however,
 this exchange was no longer appealing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmithMoralSentiments,SchumpeterCapitalism"

\end_inset

.
 In the absence of social mobility to offer for exchange, the distribution
 of resources was to occur through status competitions - a post-war process
 where positional goods and advertisement had a major role to play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
While Hirsch does seem to engage in some prophetism as he warns of rationing
 of living spaces and other public goods through status competitions, there
 are two key phenomena that are relevant to the mechanics of status competitions
 - 
\series bold
scarcity
\series default
 and 
\series bold
congestion
\series default
.
 With physical scarcity of goods largely conquered (food and amenities),
 scarcity appears largely social in the developed countries.
 More commercialization (availability of previous unavailable items through
 money) leads to more scarcities and more competitions - hence congestion
 for goods provides a measure of the degree of social scarcity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The difference between physical and social scarcities seems unclear in this
 analysis - not only because it is a difficult classification problem in
 practice but also because, according to Hirsch, the boundary between physical
 and social scarcity can get blurred by the positional goods creating a
 market for themselves.
 In context of the developing world, the creation of scarcity through 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overuse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (which Hirsch stresses as the engine of social scarcity) is less relevant
 as the congestion for goods is less often for status needs (physical scarcities
 are severe in the developing world).
 However, with recent developments in the underdeveloped world we are more
 likely to see a mixed effect of commercialization and physical scarcities
 with an increasing effect of status competitions.
 The distinction between physical and social scarcity may be blurred in
 the developing countries just the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Frank's interpretation of social scarcity is a relevant extension to the
 model of status competitions.
 In this model, social interaction amongst participants is a proxy of congestion.
 Focusing primarily on income distribution, Frank's axiomatic claim - that
 in the absence of monopolies, corporations cannot survive by rewarding
 talent alone and are thus compelled to depend on status competitions for
 income distribution - provides a microeconomic illustration of social scarcity
 (wherein attributes such as workplace safety get deprioritised because
 of status maximization goals).
 The role of social interaction is equally relevant in the developing countries
 where industrial development and societal competitions have interacted
 and clashed very recently (See Section

A note on the notion of scarcity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scarcity can be a confusing term since it encompasses both a so-called physical
 scarcity (unavailability) and the perceived scarcity (what we feel as scarce).
 We'll assume that all felt scarcities are physically scarce (otherwise
 consumers would acquire the item that is meant to be scarce).
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $F\subset S$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 denotes the felt scarcities and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 the direct physical scarcities.
 Unfortunately, the perceptions of quality of life are entities that cannot
 be measured easily but still may qualify as felt scarcities.
 This makes the claims on scarcity as a driver of demand particularly difficult.
 Wherever used in the study, the term scarcity implies the notion of perceived
 scarcity (
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

) which may be affected by artificial unavailability or barriers (i.e.
 such barriers may extend 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 by including entities available only through status competitions, advertising
 or other social-psychological communication).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Further, the nature of item matters for perceived scarcity since the direction
 of the effect of popularity on perceived scarcity can reverse depending
 on the demand of the item (visual or status-related).
 If everybody has a certain item, then consumers may not consider it so
 important to acquire the item (since everyone else already has it) whereas
 for other types of item, consumers may rush to the item solely because
 there is a trend amongst everybody else to acquire.
 These are the snob and bandwagon types of item considered in the literature

Both Fred Hirsch and Joseph Schumpeter - whose work frequently works are

 achieve the higher social positions once held by the feudal elite

 Developments of the last century in Africa and Asia bear similarity to
 this phenomenon where a new working class has clashed with feudal and colonial
 systems of the century before.
 The growing status competitions amongst the nascent working classes have
 been a subject of sociological study in the late 20th century.
 In India of the 1950s, for example, this competition was termed as Sanskritizat

It would be inaccurate though to draw wide-ranging conclusions based on
 economic poverty.
 The administrative successes and stabilities of post-colonial governments
 are varied and have depended on the extent of agrarian empires that had
 existed before.
 The extractive administrative frameworks of Ottoman or Moghul empires,
 for example, could be adapted well by European colonists in Asian countries
 when compared to the administrative units (much as the political boundaries
 themselves) created in sub-Saharan Africa.

Despite regional differences, the political landscape of Asian and African
 economies is dominated by effects of decolonization - a process that encompasse
s the loosely similar post-war political voices in Asia and Africa aspiring
 to establish nation-states.
 While centralization was attempted for decades in both Asia and Africa
 - often curtailing local-level status competitions and individual freedoms
 alike - their limited reach and success has prevented the freedom of status
 competitions.
 It is difficult to observe whether countries undergoing military conflict
 have higher measures of status competitions but there is little doubt that
 government-driven resettlements and urban movements of the 20th century
 can have an impact on identities and the pace of industrialisation (both
 of which affect status-related consumption).

Competitions for Social mobility

\begin_layout Standard
As far as market principles can work, status and mobility have a key role
 to play in economic development.
 The core of Adam Smith's arguments is that economic progress can be achieved
 by letting an exchange between the rich and poor thrive.
 In a world where Adam Smith lived, to quote from Wicksteed, trinkets could
 be turned into bread
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 From a certain point of view, more spending on a conspicuous item would
 benefit the society as a whole - since the money obtained from the rich
 on the item could potentially fund employment and other opportunities.
 Electricity would for example be a model item for this purpose in Africa
 - an item whose consumption can drive the expansion of power plants and
 make electricity cheaper.
 From such a perspective, more spending on signaling goods does not appear
 to be a social waste.
 However, not all goods are as desirable as electricity and there may be
 goals more desirable than what the said exchange can provide.
 A perspective offered by Frederich Hirsch was that in the Western world,
 the differences between the rich and poor have already been reduced to
 a level that this exchange (or the workings of the invisible hand) could
 not be made lucrative to the poor any more.
 Under the pressure of its own success, therefore, the exchange now faces
 the price of luxuries having exceeded the opportunity cost to the rest
 of the society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the basic needs for the masses haven't been addressed in the developing
 world, there are reasons to think that an exchange between rich and poor
 can draw the masses out of poverty in Africa.
 There are again limits to achieving this success in the developing countries.
 The essential goods often lack a market in the developing countries and
 since marketable goods often create needs on their own, the development
 of market for conspicuous goods may prevent the status competitions away
 from achieving the goals of social welfare.
 The way societies are structured, anything available to the richer sections
 of the society can easily become a status good and thus the possibility
 of a social waste cannot be ruled out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limits to welfare can in fact be further worsened by weak institutions.
 The developing countries seem to have followed their own paths to economic
 development while achieving goals of nationalism - and they now face the
 problem of institutions not being strong enough to establish the said exchange
 between the rich and the poor.
 In the new urban settings in Africa, both tribal identities and the hierarchies
 formed through education, money or industrial assets now contribute to
 status competitions.
 While this development can encourage institutions of money and education
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Status differences as such are only going to spur consumption on status
 goods (education should be considered as part of status consumption).
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the status competitions in absence of welfare-centered institutions can
 limit themselves to markets not developed enough to undertake physical
 scarcities.

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between education, urban developments, income levels and
 tribal identities is difficult to assess without access to the microdata
 on tribal identities and regional migration.
 In absence of such data (as is the case with LSMS used in the study), we
 may consider other proxies that may correlated with social identities (e.g.
 family income levels, language spoken, locality etc.

 power.
 The measurement error problems may be further worsened by complicated changes
 in identities themselves - that are homogenising with expansion of internal
 trade (investments from South Africa and Western countries have for example

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In simple terms, a signaling product indicates the buyer's status to the
 immediate surroundings.
 Status being a sociological phenomenon, it becomes non-trivial to classify
 a good as a signaling good.
 If for example, only the rich could afford electricity in a society, electricit
y may not appear as a signaling product for most of the population.
 From the point of view of consumption, a good being used by a smaller and
 richer part of the population has less significance than a good used by
 the majority of the population.
 This observation is relevant in a regression with consumption on an item
 as the dependent variable.
 For a selection approach to represent the zero consumption on an item,
 we consider the supply of an item.
 This is based on the observation that when an item is in limited supply,
 only those consumers with higher purchasing power (or those who must pass
 some other barrier) would have access to it.
 For example, if electricity is not available throughout the country, then
 only those with higher income or with residence in certain areas (where
 there is electricity) can have their signaling needs fulfilled with the
 item.
 In other words, when expenditure on the item is limited to the richer sections
 of society, then the item is a status good merely through being a statement
 of wealth

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Flocking towards the item
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The price of the item in the market or other barriers for distribution of
 the desired item matters is not all that determines a status good.
 A status good needs to be understood in relation to other commodities.
 As a preliminary analysis, we rely on time-series change of the budget
 share (analysis of elasticities) to see how sensitive the budget share
 of an item is to time, income and supply.
 The equilibrium consumption values can shift when a higher supply is provided
 (more electrical power plants or cheaper alternative energy would reduce
 the budget share on electricity).
 If the budget share of electricity is high or increases then we can consider
 that people may be flocking to the commodity (income elasticity may also
 partially captures this).
 The causes for this flocking (whether the consumers feel they're in a better
 status) are beyond the scope of a budget survey - but whether an increased
 supply would increase the consumption significantly indicates the consumption
 pressure to the commodity

\begin_layout Standard
This method of classification can only provide some candidates for status
 goods - but as long as everybody wants higher status it can be argued that
 all status goods would exhibit a change in budget share with respect to
 supply (a snob item - where more abundance causes disinterest would report
 a decrease in budget share - thus for items that are available only to
 the rich are likely to become snob items)

The dynamics of urban migration may thus serve as a test-bed of consumption

 A flight to urban areas is often an escape from despondent circumstances

 In addition to opportunities of income and social mobility, the cities
 in the developing economies provide a range of products that are entirely
 absent from the agrarian rural settings.
 This may provide a model better than rational expectations model where
 the expected income payoff from migration is not known by the migrant.

 We wish to enhance this model by considering that the demand for urban

 by migration trends with indigenes displacing non-indigenes and the more
 educated replacing the less educated in conventional occupations.

 is the quantity demanded, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 is the vector of prices).
 The constraints translates into the homogeneity constraint (

\end_inset

) as well as the adding-up constraint (
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma p_{k}q_{k}=x)$

 The adding-up constraint is often written as

Shape of the utility curve - Particular Restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The restrictions of adding-up and homogeneity are often too general to provide
 any meaningful interpretation of utility.
 The empirical work therefore often involves further restrictions on the
 shape of utility curves.
 The most important property of the utility curve arises out of the revealed
 preference model - which assumes that for set of choices 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 may be 
\shape italic
always
\shape default
 preferred in presence of both 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The demand functions ( 
\begin_inset Formula $q=g(x)$
\end_inset

 ) would be well behaved if once an item 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is 
\shape italic
revealed
\shape default
 as preferred to item 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 would be preferred to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 even if the consumer was compensated more.
 This was originally proposed by Samuelson and then extended to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 items by Houthakker.
 The revealed preference theory leads to the Slutsky equations (that give
 us the matrix of substitution effects) - which can be summarised as the
 negative-semi-definiteness of the substitution matrix and the symmetry
 of cross-substitution effects

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of conspicuous consumption, the preferences are expected
 to be comparable and transitive.
 The axiom of revealed preference is thus expected to hold i.e.
 when an item is revealed preferred to another item - then more income would
 continue to maintain that item preferred.
 However, assuming any further restrictions on the utility curves requires
 a theoretical justification as well as the empirical tests associated with
 assumption of the shape of the utility curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A commonly used restriction is that of separability.
 A convenient way to think of separability (and the necessary and sufficient
 conditions for it
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The necessary and sufficient condition for separability is the marginal
 rate of substitution between any two variables in the same group being
 independent of a variable in any other group.
\end_layout

\end_inset

) is to view separability as a hierarchy of needs - i.e.
 a utility tree - where needs are split into multiple groups - each of which
 further expands as sub-groups that eventually enlist individual items.
 The items in each group can be rearranged within the group by the consumer
 without affecting the items in other groups (except through the effect
 of the expenditure associated with the item on the total income).
 An aggregation of this tree is equivalent to the combination of sub-utility
 functions that each of the branch in the tree corresponds to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optimal utility problem then amounts to optimising sub-utility functions
 i.e.
 the utility in each group and then in the aggregation of groups.
 For every group 
\begin_inset Formula $r\epsilon G$
\end_inset

, the consumer would thus optimise 
\begin_inset Formula $c(u_{r},p_{r})=min[x=\sum q_{i}p_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{r}(x,p_{r})=u_{r}]$
\end_inset

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{r}$

 in these problems would be chosen subject to the combined utility function
 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{G}$

If conspicuous items were considered as a group, then separability of such
 a group from other groups of utility such as entertainment, education or
 even food does may not be possible.
 This is because an item can be of both conspicuous and a more utilitarian
 value at the same time.
 The condition for an separable group is that a consumer can order the items
 within the group without considering an item outside the group (except
 through the effect of the item in the group to the consumer's total budget).
 In case of a group comprising of conspicuous items, a consumer can order
 items within the group of conspicuous items with considering any item outside
 the group (of non-conspicious items) only if i) the difference between
 conspicuous and non-conspicuous items is clear and ii) all conspicuous
 items don't belong in any other group.
 In reality, all items reachable within the budget may be of some conspicuous
 value to the consumer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate this idea, let's assume that we have only the following items
 in the consumer universe: cigarettes, cheap and expensive varieties of
 both potatoes and tomatoes and cinema.
 Signaling preference order for one consumer might be cigars
\begin_inset Formula $>$

expensive potatoes
\begin_inset Formula $>$

 expensive tomatoes 
\begin_inset Formula $>$

 cheap potatoes 
\begin_inset Formula $>$

 cheap tomatoes.
 The status needs may be fulfilled for the consumer by either expenditure
 on cinema or on cigar.
 Another consumer might be satisfied with expensive tomatoes for the status
 need.
 All consumers can achieve different statuses or signaling benefits from
 several items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key argument against separability is therefore status in itself is derived
 from a collection of items - thus the idea of every item imparting a certain
 utility and combining them often makes little sense.
 To model the group of conspicuous items is to model the mechanism that
 indicates status - which is indicated by consumers to associate themselves
 to a richer (or high status) group of individuals through expenditure (this
 view of status consumption derives from the literature on snob and bandwagon
 items

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Status isn't an ordinal utility Therefore, education and watches can both
 indicate status - at times of similar kinds.
 It is quite difficult to measure status-utility as one-dimensional goal
 in itself (status isn't an ordinal concept).
 It may be even possible to arrange view status as a configuration of top
 varieties of all other groups (instead of a group itself) - but even in
 that scenario, it wouldn't be separable.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus utility of a status good is bound to overlap with that of other goods
 - and thus the status items can be considered separable only if the visible
 items selected in the visible groups don't affect other groups at all (given
 the boundary of visible and non-visible items is clear).
 For our example, if somebody chooses cinema alone for visibility, separability
 is achieved - whereas if someone uses expensive potatoes and tomatoes for
 status, then an overlap with food takes place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A stronger form of separability is additivity is also ruled out for conspicuous
 items.
 However, if one can organize consumer universe in terms of non-conspicuous
 and conspicuous groups, strong separability (or even additivity) of groups
 may make sense (this is indeed used in the Ireland model

 ask two key questions to respondents in an online survey conducted in India.
 First asked them how closely they needed to interact with their neighbour
 (with similar demographic characteristics) in order to observe above average
 spending for a list of items (Options were -‘1: No Interaction’, ‘2: Occasional
 Interaction’, ‘3: Friend’, ‘4: Close Friend’ or ‘5: No matter how much
 one Interacts’).
 An item where >20% respondents report 1 or 2 was considered a visible item.
 A second question asked them what they'll expect of the consumption of
 an item after a sudden 20 percent rise in their neighbor's income ‘1: Fall’,
 ‘2: Stay the same’, ‘3: Increase by less than 20 percent’, ‘4: Increase
 by 20 percent’ or ‘5: Increase by more than 20 percent’.
 The list of items in these questions attempted to match the consumption
 categories in the IHDS.
 An item is associated with higher income if more than 20% of respondents
 reported 2,3,4 or 5.

 Visibility is a socio-cultural judgment - and the visibility basket from
 the developed world cannot be translated as such into disparate geographies
 and cultural environments of the developing world.
 One can arrive at wrong conclusions on visible consumption for a consumer
 group if a visibility basket was chosen from a different cultural environment.
 For example, hair-products may be associated with a higher visibility (and
 promise) in the developed world but in the developing world their purpose
 could be just utilitarian (poor quality of production, cultural factors
 etc.).
 Attributing lower visible consumption based on a low consumption of hair-produc
ts would thus be erroneous.

Another practical problem arises in the developing world because of the
 predominant use of recall method in expenditure survey.
 A relevant anomaly is the Deaton Paxson paradox(
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) - i.e.
 the observed decrease in food expenditure per head as household size rises
 (with constant outlay per head).
 The likely cause for the paradox is presence of errors correlated with
 household size in the data that results in possible overestimation of the
 consumption of recalled items

 Caution must therefore be taken (or a correction applied) when mixing expenditu

While the visibility elasticities may not be compared across countries without
 above considerations but a comparison within the country can provide insights
 into the effect of certain demographic factors on visible consumption.
 This has been the central theme for most of the studies surveyed in this
 note.
 More than to improve the measurement of visibility, the studies are interested
 in identifying the demographic parameters that explain the log-expenditure
 of visibility basket as is.
 The general regression equation for such a study is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(vis_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $vis_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the total visible consumption of the household 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (accumulated over the chosen visibility basket), 
\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and 
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the permanent income - proxied by total expenditure.
 Households with higher total expenditure are far more likely to be those
 with higher visible expenditure.
 Thus, total expenditure (on the right side of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lnvis_regression"

\end_inset

) makes it an endogenous variable for the dependent variable : 
\begin_inset Formula $ln(vis_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 A different approach is taken by Jaikumar et al who use weights in the
 basket rather than visible expenditure levels - so that visible expenditure
 is not subject to the endogeneity problem that arises due to total expenditure
 being on the right hand side and visible expenditure on left hand side
 of the equation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JaikumarConspConIneq"

\end_inset

 (The proportion of visible expenditure with respect to the total expenditure
 could be the same for those with higher total expenditure and lower total
 expenditure).
 However, since data on income is often poor or sparse in the developing
 countries, total expenditure turns out to be the most frequent choice for
 a proxy of permanent income (
\begin_inset Formula $pInc_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a key control parameter for the analysis of visible consumption).
 In most of the studies, the said endogeneity of total expenditure is resolved
 by a choice of appropriate instruments - e.g.
 income, cubic-income, positive-income dummies or occupation codes.
 These instruments identified by Charles et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 are reported to be quite strong in the studies surveyed as part of this

A model for status related consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The concept of status is rather non-trivial and has characteristics of a
 feedback system in the long-run (status may yield income through social
 barriers but requires income to be acquired).
 The Ireland model widely used in the literature treats status-signaling
 as purchasing of visible and non-visible goods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ireland_signals"

\end_inset

.
 In the Ireland model, the combined utility for every consumer is 
\begin_inset Formula $U=F(f(v,w),s)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(v,w)$
\end_inset

 is the private utility of the consumer and status 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be an increasing function of inference of others - 
\begin_inset Formula $s=f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - with 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 denoting visual consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 - the consumption that is not directly observable.
 Every consumer thus optimizes the combined private and visible utility.
 A practical consideration in the model is the separation between visible
 and non-visible consumption - a boundary that requires a socio-cultural
 judgment and has been drawn using consumer surveys in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
What research in the developing markets further points out is that the parameter
 of combined utility in a simplified model - (
\begin_inset Formula $U=(1-a)\cdot f(v,w)+a\cdot f(v,g(v)$
\end_inset

) - can vary for different sections of society.
 A slight adjustment of the model may be to add another parameter that indicates
 the consumer's social class.
 This may be relevant in the developing world where social status is yielded
 through social barriers.
 Sections of society that are endowed with a higher status capital may be
 in less of a need to purchase commodities of visible consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In the analysis of LSMS data on Tanzania so far, urban/rural differences
 have significance in the consumption of scarce commodities.
 There are two ways to incorporate this into a model of signaling - one
 is to consider these household characteristics as a social class of consumers
 so that different sensitivities for social classes is noted.
 The other is to consider these characteristics as part of conspicuous consumpti
on in the long-run.
 For example, English literacy seems to have correlation with the consumption
 of certain scarce products (e.g.
 electricity and hobby equipment) in Tanzania.
 In a model of scarcity of resources, English literacy (along with urban
 residence and other characteristics significant for consumption of scarce
 commodities) would be seen as a status commodity (capital) that is acquired
 through spending on education or migration.
 The latter is the approach to be followed in the extensions to a model
 to measure status appeal of an item in Section

 While the visibility surveys (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ZahraIndia,heffetz_visibility"

\end_inset

) attempt to study how consumption on certain commodities may signal status,
 the goal of the proposed game is to characterise environments under which
 the perceptions of a higher-status may develop.
 The game attempts to emulate i) the consumer market and ii) the mechanism
 through which status may be assigned within a group of consumers.
 It therefore relies on participants playing the dual role of a consumer
 and status-observer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The activities of purchasing and assigning status are separate in the game.
 Since a simulated purchase performed by the participants in the game (given
 a list of commodities, prices and outlay) is quite likely to deviate from
 their real world purchases and their real needs, the participants are instead
 asked what additional items they would purchase for a given a basket of
 commodities that they already possess (using a cumulative voting scheme
 that emulates selection of commodities in a market - see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Purchasing-Mechanism"

\end_inset

 for details).
 The second part of the game emulates status assignment - where participants
 assign a score of status and effectiveness each to 3 (or more) other participan
ts in the game by looking at the quantities of the item categories possessed
 and purchased by the latter.
 The judgment of status in the real world does not involve direct observance
 of prices and thus it is only the quantity of the identified items consumed
 or already possessed that matters in the status-assignment part of the
 game.
 The end-goal of the game is to purchase a basket most desired by others
 - the winner achieves this goal by purchasing commodities of her choice
 that are most desirable by everyone and are indicative of a rank higher
 than everyone else in the game.

 uses a scheme similar to cumulative voting - where 10 virtual coins are
 provided to the participant and the participant is asked to distribute
 the coins amongst a set of available items (both positional and non-positional).
 The provided outlay in the game (number of coins) may vary for participants
 - in proportion to the income distribution that is observed in the relevant

Constraints and Assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The game attempts to measure status and consumption with respect to high
 asset ownership, social class or familial responsibility.
 Since players choose between physical needs and positional needs in the
 game, a different circumstance is likely to affect their choice and hence
 their perceived status.
 The game presents a precondition to the player - indicating high asset
 ownership, a chosen social class or a familial liability.
 For example, to test a participant's choice between food and electricity,
 the game can present a large family as a constraint, and record the choice
 between spending more on food vs installing electricity.
 The game thus measures indirect effects of reward or constraints on status
 by allowing participants to gauge the suitability of a participant's choice
 in the status game in the presence of constraints (familial) or rewards
 (asset-related).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Notice that the constraint variable is only planned to be binary in the
 current scheme i.e.
 it is either a reward or a liability (when present).
 The two values are expected to have an opposite affect on the purchase
 of new items.
 Admittedly, the binary values of constraints vs rewards circumvent the
 difficulty in comparisons between disparate needs of the consumers - e.g.
 a large family, senior member or a social event (e.g.
 marriage/funeral).
 While a multi-valued variable (if adopted) can potentially provide better
 insights into the relative effects of these several types constraints,
 the goal of the current exercise is to test for a direct effect of constraints
 on status (rather than relative effect of the various possible constraints).

Status ranking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The status-ranking activity involves a student assigning a status score
 by looking at i) what the other participant with a given income level does
 with the extra outlay and ii) what the participant already possesses.
 In the ranking scheme, the participants provide a score on effectiveness
 as well as status to all the other (3 or more) participants observed.
 Notice that in presence of constraints specified in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:constraints"

\end_inset

, regardless of whether one is selfish or not, a participant would tend
 to penalise someone else who she thinks is going to be more selfish than
 herself.
 Since the game provides a way to penalize selfishness by status ranks,
 the participants are discouraged from indicating status through overspending
 on positional items.
 The penalty for not caring for a sick parent may be huge in the society
 but so can be the penalty for being stingy.
 Similarly, while some may want to indicate wealth by buying a watch they
 may also fear disrespect for not taking care of a sick family member.
 The scores on effectiveness and status are thus not only a way to discourage
 the consumer from limiting the unrealistic purchases in the simulated purchasin
g part of the game, they also track the effect of the externalities such
 as sickness or age (measured through the binary variable discussed in section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

While consumers try to maximise their utility by purchasing more items for
 a given limited outlay - they also manage their prestige by letting others
 have a better opinion of themselves.

 commodity (used in

For a good that is not positional, one expects that the consumers from lower
 and higher quantiles of total expenditure (x-axis) would consume similar
 amounts of the good (y-axis).
 For a positional good, the consumers spending higher expenditure on the
 good would lean towards consumers with higher total expenditure.
 This does not indicate visibility signaling in any way - but tests only
 whether a commodity is consumed uniformly amongst those with lower and
 higher total expenditure outlays (this is rather a measure of scarcity
 of the item than of its visibility).
 Choosing different thresholds (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta)$
\end_inset

 provides a a control on the degree to which a certain commodity can be
 included in our conspicuous consumption basket.

In the data from Tanzania, while top 56% of consumers show spending on rice,
 electricity appears to be a luxury when only top 22 % of consumers spend
 on it.
 This does not necessitate that a higher consumption of electricity indicates
 higher status but a higher threshold for electricity certainly indicates
 its physical scarcity which may permit status competitions.

Not all scarce objects can be indicative of status - we often need some
 judgment to decide which products may indicate status signaling.
 A survey accomplishes this by ranking all products as viewed by its respondents.
 It must also be noted that visibility or positional signaling of a commodity
 is hardly orthogonal to major expenditure categories.
 The usual arguments of additive utilities cannot hold for conspicuous consumpti
on.
 In other words, if walnut turns out to be of visible significance (ranked
 high in the consumers' perception of visibility in the survey) then one
 can no longer talk about the combined utility of food and visible items
 (walnut is both a food item and a visible good)

Notice that one needs to be careful while drawing conclusions based on consumpti
on of commodities that are themselves selected based on the percentiles
 of consumption levels.
 For example, if we declare commodities that i) are accessible by no more
 than 50% of the consumers and ii) have their expenditure rising with permanent
 income as scarce items (i.e.
 items that are likely to indicate status), then the items thus identified
 are - by definition - items that the rich are more likely to afford.
 We cannot select items that the only richer section of society indulges
 in and claim that people spending on these selected items indicate higher
 status.
 Such a claim is only a restatement of the high permanent income and says
 nothing more substantial than that the richer population sections signal
 higher status.
 It would be a fallacy to associate visible consumption with household character
istics by only associating household characteristics with permanent income.
 The threshold method that we use only measures the

 of the item (e.g.
 electricity is more scarce than food) - not status or visibility per se
 - which involve some socio-cultural judgment.
 That scarcity itself has an indirect effect on status competitions cannot
 be denied - but this effect is not measured by the threshold method of
 classifying alone.

In recent decades, the urban settlements in Africa have seen massive overpopulat

 The differences in urban-rural lifestyles have increased.
 The scarcity of services and of industrial goods (which would be a necessity
 in the Western world) seem evidently sparse in the developing countries
 (a claim that is verified by data on Tanzania).

A relevant question amidst these developments is whether a consumer prefers
 a larger house over installation of electricity or not.

 more lifestyle choices.

 may further help measure the impact of such scarcities on consumer preferences.
 It is noted that many of the items are scarce together (carpets and housing-sta
tus, electricity and hobby equipment, etc.) .
 It is through such denial of goods and services that status perceptions
 develop.
 A simple view of observed scarcities can be provided by a directed graph
 of items for classification - where a node is an item and points to other
 nodes/items that it denies (which themselves can be formed with items that
 deny other items and so and so forth).
 For example, electricity can be a node in this graph with connections to
 equipment and electronics but no connection to food items.
 The disconnected nodes in the graph - would be least likely to be affected
 by another unreachable node in the graph.
 The criteria of connections (denials) would be determined by statistical
 significance e.g.
 rice and walnuts appear would not be scarce together if one of them is
 available and affordable by both higher and lower quantiles of permanent
 income of society.
 This would be developed further as the study progresses.

Heffetz considers the visibility of items and conducts a visibility survey
 to find that the degree to which people notice items explains the corresponding

 This observation has provided the basis for inspection of visible consumption
 in many studies thereforth.
 In an environment of inequalities, however, it is likely that the individuals
 with perceived higher status notice items differently from how the lower
 status individuals might notice them.
 The social factors thus also become relevant for the difference in visible
 preferences in the developing countries.
 In India, these are religion and caste (lower casters may spend more on
 visible items) - while in South Africa and United States, race seems to
 have a dominant significance (blacks, hispanics spend more on visible items).

 found that the consumption of visible items (for a certain selected criterion)
 differs significantly between social classes

Conspicuous consumption in developing economies encompasses more than just
 noticeability (visibility).
 While visible consumption may detail the mechanics of status competitions
 in a narrow sense where consumers participate in a market to increase their
 perceived status - but it does not provide an adequate picture of conspicuous
 consumption which is tied to of status.
 One reason for the inadequacy of visibility as a measure for status consumption
, is that the markets are underdeveloped in the developing world and social
 status is largely yielded through economic classes and social conditions.
 The second - probably more significant - reason is that status signaling
 does not exist in a society as an inherent need for visible appeal amongst
 humans.
 Instead visible consumption matters because of an item being associated
 with a higher status (at least in the sense which Veblen had talked about
 in his 19th century treatise

In both the developed and developing worlds, conspicuous consumption is

 If status were imparted by inherited wealth alone, there would be little
 conspicuous consumption as the consumers would be quick to realise the
 futility of buying trinkets.
 In the developed world, where markets have evolved to address the demands
 of the population, the positional pressures are readily addressed by market
 forces - thus a preference for visible goods indicates a higher price on
 them and a higher consumption on visible products always

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 a higher status (a product with a higher status symbol would automatically
 carry a higher price).
 In underdeveloped markets, where information asymmetries are abound, the
 higher signalling (visible component of combined utility) would not necessarily
 be achieved with higher spending on visible goods - and factors such as
 social standing, asset ownership and educational level (which too are visible)
 start to matter in the combined utility function - as is suggested by data
 from various cross-section expenditure surveys.
 In Tanzania, for example, the spending on marriage and funerals seems high,
 but it now competes with higher spending on consumer electronics and electricit
y.

 to understand the reasons behind status-signaling by looking at the differences

 how unavailability of items (scarcity) as well as disparities of services
 across regions and classes in a society are reflected in both price and

Measuring status appeal - Availability, Affordability and Popularity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The challenge to a theory for conspicuous consumption is the difference
 between what people can buy (with the available options for a given price
 and budget in the market locally) and what they wish to buy instead (options
 that could change the current consumption when they become available).
 While the income elasticity for every item in the consumption category
 indicates how the consumption changes with response to increase in income
 or prices, the degree to which consumption on existing items would change
 by introduction of a new item or category (e.g.
 a new technology) is not explained by elasticities of demand of existing
 categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
In analysis of a typical consumption survey, the substitution effect of
 the item explains whether consumers like an item more than the other while
 whether consumers buy more of the same item as they become richer and the
 price goes lower is captured by the income effect.
 While the analysis is typically based on the utility derived from products
 in the consumer basket, the research on conspicuous consumption has pointed
 out to relevance of visibility and scarcity of items in the utility function.
 To explore some such factors into the model for utility, the current study
 separates the price and budget concerns from the signaling appeal of the
 item.
 The conventional price and budget concerns are encompassed by 
\series bold
affordability

 of the item (which is simply a statement of price of the item).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Since the elasticities of products interpreted from the consumption data
 cannot measure how consumption might be transformed if new items were introduce
d, we introduce a parameter to measure the availability of the item.
 This is based on the observation that consumption on the same item varies
 between regions that have another item available vs places where the item
 is completely unavailable.
 In developing countries, the issue of availability is particularly relevant
 since rural areas are faced with unavailability of services and goods that
 are available (although limited) in the urban areas
\begin_inset Foot

 In the data from Tanzania, not only are region dummies significant in consumpti
on of items in the survey (particularly with respect to such as electricity
 which is completely unavailable in large parts of the country), but the
 availability of electricity seems to transform the income elasticities
 of demand for other expenditures as well (e.g.
 marriage).
 A model that we wish to develop for appeal of an item attempts to include
 this difference in availability between regions.
 This is why 
\series bold
availability
\series default
 is introduced as a concern different from affordability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than price-budget concerns (affordability) and issues of supply (availabil
ity), status-signaling item can be tracked by its demand in the richer sections
 of the society.
 Higher popularity of the item (i.e.
 higher number of purchasers of the item in the population of consumers)
 can drive the appeal of the item down or up.
 Items like jewelry and luxury cars are those that cannot become extremely
 popular by definition.
 If such items were to become popular, then the richer consumers would rush
 to something else that indicates their higher status.
 Such items are known as snob items.
 Items which people rush to purchase - on the other hand - are called bandwagon
 items.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
It is worth emphasizing that in a market where product differentiation exists,
 items can change from snob type to bandwagon type (or vice versa) over
 time.
 It is important to have a dynamic model for bandwagon characteristics of
 an item.
 Items like new electronics are snob items when they're not affordable -
 but as they become more affordable with time they become bandwagon items.
 As consumers rush to them, they get replaced by a new snob item in the
 market.
  The effect of popularity of an item on to its demand can thus be in either
 direction i.e.
 limited supply would mean a higher appeal for snob items but high supply
 would mean less appeal.
 A time-series of expenditures can help us understand the trend in rushing
 towards certain items.
 The degree to which consumers rush to an item is termed as the bandwagon
 effect in the study
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\paragraph_spacing single
The snob or bandwagon effects must be seen in combination with affordability
 and availability.
 If the item is available and not affordable - then the price and budget
 constraints are more important than the bandwagon characteristics of the
 item.
 The snob or bandwagon nature of the item matters for an individual consumer
 only when it is affordable (thus potentially popular) as well as available.
 This is in accordance with the discussion in Section

In summary, the appeal of a certain commodity can be estimated by its availabili
ty, affordability and popularity in the model.
 Availability encompasses all issues that put an item in the market.
 Regional and supply-side issues thus affect availability.
 In absence of the data on supply of the items, we assign availability as
 a binary variable which is set to true in a region when the item appears
 in the consumption data for the region.
 Affordability, on the other hand, sums up price-related concerns on the
 demand-side.
 An item is affordable solely based on the price of the average consumption
 unit.
 Further, the popularity of an item is measured as percentile of users of
 item i.e.
 the percentile which consumes the quantity.
 Popularity of an item may increase or decrease the consumption of an item
 based on whether the item is a snob or bandwagon type.
 An individual is likely to lose interest in a particular jewelry product
 if it the latter is available and affordable to everybody.
 In the Hirschian terminology

For every individual an item is more affordable if its cost is within the
 threshold percentage of the (permanent) income.
 If consumers spend a high portion of their income on rice than on vegetables,
 then using the simple price criterion, rice is less affordable than vegetables.
 One reason for choosing a method based on total cost spent on the item
 is the unavailability of quantities of consumption in the diary recall
 section - where only total costs of the item have been collected (rather
 than prices or quantities).
 Semantically, affordability is a statement of price in the market and should
 be calculated from the average price of the item.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
For example, to answer whether AC is more affordable than electricity (the
 two are compared only to stress that any two commodities can be compared
 based on the criterion), we use just average cost of AC in the population
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 consumers (i.e.
 for item 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 amongst total  number of items the average price is 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}(\frac{q_{i}}{\Sigma^{K}q_{k}})$
\end_inset

 ).
 If average expenditure on AC amongst those who buy AC (i.e.
 the cost of AC) is higher than than the respective mean for electricity,
 then AC would be considered less affordable than electricity.
 That electricity is a service and consumed immediately (as opposed to AC
 which is an asset) is currently ignored in the model.
 The dependency amongst items is also ignored in the model.
 (i.e.
 that one cannot consume A.C.
 without consuming electricity is ignored).

Measuring Reference Popularity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Appeal of items within the social-psychological communication is based on
 perceived differences between life standards and is thus relative to a
 reference area.
 At local levels this could be due to disparate neighborhoods while at national
 levels, reference areas could be metropolitan cities.
 The choice of reference area cannot be arbitrary - reference area is decided
 only between regions that are socially and economically inter-connected
 and thus where sufficient flow of information and people is possible.
 For the current analysis, Dar-es-salaam (region =7) is chosen as the reference
 area.
 The measure of popularity of an item is thus the reference area - i.e.
 the percentile of consumers using the product in the reference area.
 For example, only about 25% of the surveyed population uses electricity.
 Thus the popularity metric is set to .25 for electricity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
The increase in appeal if the popularity in reference area were to increase
 (through increase in local availability) can be a proxy of the bandwagon
 effect of an item - i.e.
 a measure of how strongly an item's demand would increase as an items is
 more popular.
 If we denote the popularity of an item in the reference area by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ref}$
\end_inset

, then the measure of this effect is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial A}{\partial\rho_{ref}}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 the change in appeal of the item in the reference area with respect to
 the change in the popularity of the item.
 Since appeal is represented by the demand of the item in the consumption
 survey, we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\rho_{ref}}=\frac{\partial A}{\partial\rho_{ref}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\frac{q}{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the quantity purchased, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the total expenditure, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the appeal and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ref}$
\end_inset

 is the item's popularity in the reference area.
 If items have become more popular over time and if consumers are on average
 spending a higher portion of their income on the item, then the bandwagon
 effect of the item would be considered strong

We extrapolate weekly diary to annual expense in Step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 With large size of families (40% of households have size 5 or higher),
 it may be common to stock items for consumption.
 Items such as soap, skin creams are likely to be purchased in bulk in large
 families.
 The frequency of purchases gets lower as the quantity of bulk purchases
 increase- this may cause us to overestimate consumption significantly.
 One way to adjust the quantity is by estimating the storage using the number
 of rooms as a proxy of storage space.
 However, the store and consume consumption pattern does not require plenty
 of storage space and may not depend on the number of room.
 Another way to test for store-and-consume pattern is testing the closest
 market from the household.
 The data for distance from market (or the cost of public transport) is
 quite sparse (a lot of NAs).
 The NAs in the data could be because the market as described in the survey
 is never visited or that it doesn't exist in the immediate region.
 Assuming that the habit of stocking is uniform throughout the country (this
 may sound a sweeping assumption - but since we do take region into account
 - we should be able to account regional differences), we can find household
 factors (e.g.
 household size or distance from market) that may affect consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
To test whether the store-and-consume habit is significant, we have the
 expenditure on the item 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, the total expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the distance from the market 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed that anybody recalling the purchase in the last month would
 be repeating that purchase every month.
 This ignores that those who are stockpiling might not need to purchase
 the item again for another few months - which can overestimate the purchases
 for stockpilers - whose habit is unobservable in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $q=x+d+region+\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is endogenous in the model where stockpiling behavior may influence 
\begin_inset Formula $q,x$
\end_inset

.
 A reasonable assumption is that the percentage of stockpilers to the regional
 population is constant i.e.
 there are no reasons why the percentage of stockpilers would change within
 a region within a period of a few years.
 We can thus assume in any two regions A, B with populations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta p_{B}$
\end_inset

 stockpilers (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the fixed frequency of stockpilers).
 These stockpilers would buy less frequently but there is no reasons to
 believe that they would consume more than the non-stockpilers.
 Thus if stockpilers and non-stockpilers live within a region in the same
 ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, we should observe fixed differences (clusters) in all regions (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is fixed).
 We perform this analysis at the region level (the data on district level
 is limited - at times only 7 consumers in the district).
 Some region dummies do appear significant - but only for more populous
 regions.
 Overall the effect of hsize dominates even if we resample the data in smaller
 samples.
 In summary, given the low effect of the travelcosts on ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $log(\frac{q}{x})$
\end_inset

 (as shown in Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{skincreamconsu}
\end_layout

\end_inset

) and the lack of different means (clusters) in the region, we can be assured
 that stockpiling is not significant.
 It is more likely that larger families buy more quantities of goods such
 as skincream.

Effect of occupation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Income data in LSMS is not available for all the surveyed households.
 This may indicate the presence of informal sector in Tanzania.
 A few occupations in the survey are neither well defined nor are truly
 an indicator of total income.
 The presence of categories like unpaid-family-work and of individuals with
 no-primary-job getting a significant income from their secondary occupations
 makes the task of associating the primary occupation of the household head
 with her income rather difficult (i.e.
 occupation - which is available for all household heads cannot be used
 as a proxy of household income - which is not available for all households
 in the survey).
 Grouping the occupations into fewer categories than in the survey (by putting
 paid/unpaid family work and agriculture under the same category for example)
 allows for the smoothening of the effect of individual occupations and
 may serve as a proxy of socioeconomic classes in the country.
 Without or without this grouping, the effect of occupation has been found
 significant on the consumption of scarce commodities.
 The results are shown in Table

Population density

Population density is a crude measure for crowding in the cities.
 The regions with higher population density do have a slight effect on consumpti

 It is hoped that a urban/rural dummy created by classifying districts based

 levels) may give a more detailed view on the effect of population density
 on conspicuous consumption.

One of the interesting observations in the Vindex survey (Heffetz

 It is found that services tend to be less 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in the Western consumer world.
 The clustering might not be as clear-cut in the developing world - where
 social stratification is severe and many services are contractual (non-monetary
).
 The socio-cultural barriers might have an effect through access to services.

Towards that claim, English education as a control parameter is found quite
 significant for positional consumption.
 Those who identify themselves as English speakers tend to spend more on
 scarce commodities.
 This indicates that English education may be quite scarce - and while it
 isn't reflected in the consumer expenditure market data so easily - it's
 likely to play a role in status competitions.

While a commodity for private consumption (e.g.
 skin-cream or hobby-equipment in the LSMS data) might have an appeal for
 everyone - whether it signals high-status or not is a social psychological
 concern and cannot be assessed from the household survey by itself.
 In the absence of a visibility survey (asking the respondents how much
 they notice a product and whether they associate the product with high-income
 or not), one may still continue the discussion of the potential conspicuous
 value of items by looking at how scarce the item is (based on the percentile
 of consumers of the commodity).
 This is akin to repeating the analysis of conspicuous consumption with
 a given commodity as the only constituent of the conspicuous consumption
 basket.
 The percentile of consumers using a given commodity (e.g.
 top 22% for electricity) and the slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $log(commodity-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $log(total-expenditure)$
\end_inset

 can tell us if richer sections of society spend more on a certain commodity
 and if the poorer sections of society consume the chosen commodity at all
 (the commodities chosen in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 are those where this slope is significant).
 The regression based on data prepared from the last step attempts to calculate
 the coefficients of the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(csp_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\cdot Dem_{i}+\beta_{2}\cdot ln(pInc_{i})+\epsilon\label{eq:lnvis_regression-2}

Here

\begin_inset Formula $Dem_{i}$

 is a vector of demographic indicators under consideration and

 summarize the results obtained by running regressions on several commodity-cate

 A column in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_results"

\end_inset

 also suggests the percentile of consumers using the commodity (electricity
 for example is used amongst those having top 22% of total expenditure).
 The usage of commodities such as skincream and other-personal-products
 (shampoos, razors etc.) are widespread compared with sports or hobby equipment
 and electricity.
 For commodities that are rare and consumed only amongst the richer sections
 of the society (those with higher total expenditure) the effect of English
 literacy is significant.
 Similarly, hsize has a significant effect on both educational expense and
 personal products (using number of children instead of hsize could provide
 better association with education expense).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
We cannot claim from the results that the population spends more on status
 commodities than education.
 What we can claim however, is that electricity is more scarce than education.
 Further, in areas where food is expensive, spending on marriage reduces
 - particularly by the occupations that may bring higher incomes.
 This marks a preference towards industrial goods in the urban (expensive)
 areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing single
Another observation that can possibly help in modeling scarcity is that
 scarcity of items seems to occur in clusters of objects.
 Carpets-rugs require a certain housing status and access to English depends
 on region.
 Similarly, many hobby equipment may require access to electricity etc.
 The clustering of these items essentially point to the urban-rural differences
 in the country.

Future Directions

The methodology for measuring the appeal of an item from the point of view
 of scarcity would be improved and applied to data available other African

 A comparison with results from other developing countries such as India
 would follow.
