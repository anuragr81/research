Hi,

I am currently a student at London Business School and was interested in pursuing a PhD program at the school. The research projec that I have in mind attempts to identiy conspciuous consumption in Africa - in comparison to Asia and hopes to get inputs for policy and investments research. 

I am sending this email after viewing your background in development of econmics and to see if there is a possibility for me to work under your supersvision.  Any recommendations or suggestions otherwise would be equally helpful.

I work in London and am happy to meet or talk on phone if you're interested.

regards,
-Anurag
