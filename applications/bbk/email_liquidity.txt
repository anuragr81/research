Hi,

I am a student at London Business School and have worked in the finance industry for past 7 years. I am interested in conducting research on the effect of changes in cross-asset liquidity on the popular and not-so-popular models of equity valuations. I wish to explore the explanatory power of liquidity the way volatility has been explored for FX rates and portfolio valuations. Having had a background in quant work for trading (high frequency and ).

Looking at your research background - more particularly the paper on - I wondered if you would be open to offering any supervisory guidance if I were to be admitted as a PhD student. Any suggestions or pointers would be equally helpful.

I work in London and am happy to meet or talk on phone if you're interested.

Thanks very much,
