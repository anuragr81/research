Sorry for the unprompted message. I am a student at London Business School and am interested in researching as a PhD student at <NAME>. The project I have in mind looks at effects of cross-asset liquidity on equity valuations. I wish to explore the explanatory power of measures of  liquidity the way volatility has been explored for FX rates and portfolio valuations. 

I have a background in quant work for trading (high frequency and risk management ) and looking at your research in econometrics, I wondered if you might be open to offering supervisory guidance to an admitted PhD student. Any suggestions or pointers otherwise would be equally helpful.

I work  in London and would be happy to meet or talk on phone if you're interested. Do let me know if you would like to take a look at the research proposal in its current form.

regards
