Statement of Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2007, when I was working in my first job at JP Morgan - I had been trained
 only to work on rational problems.
 I had been simulating air pollution at a lab before and my task at the
 bank was to improve the methods to calculate credit risk exposures for
 the firm's OTC portfolio.
 I was thrilled - to say the least - at the sophistication involved in what
 was seemingly an accounting activity.
 I worked with the firm for three years - and joined a trading desk soon
 afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be wrong to say that I had quit the risk management division because
 I was tired of reading accounting rules as a trained scientist.
 On the contrary, I only wanted to learn more about economics - since my
 limited understanding of accounting had often led me to a void.
 Reading the Basel III accord, for example, it occurred to me for the first
 time that such rules are written not to invent a new theory - but only
 in response to the kind of incidents we had talked about in our daily meetings.
 Having been presented the issues of risk management always as a rational
 problem seemed to have hindered my understanding of the forces of economy.
 Kant's claim that

 had never made more sense to me until then.

\begin_layout Standard
The curiosity drove me to work at trading desks on both sides of the Atlantic
 and during this time, the need to acquire skills that I hadn't been trained
 into were fulfilled by reading and researching online.
 Calibration of interest rate models or searching for arbitrage opportunities
 had occupied most of my work life - but I still couldn't say that I had
 appreciated the humanities much.
 It was only during a class in behavioural finance at London Business School
 last year - that I came to realize the true scope of my work.
 Studying economics and reading Adam Smith, Irving Fisher, Lord Keynes along
 with Karl Marx, Max Weber and David Graeber on my way back from school,
 I came to understand that the insights in human mind was a necessary component
 in what I had been working on and that the scope of academic research has
 to be immensely wider than what I had experienced in the finance industry.
 The trader psychology at work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to research about the behavioral sides of economics and see how traders
 behave.
 This is a work of interdisciplinary nature and I need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I view my decision to pursue research at the program as a culmination of
 this curiosity and a growing commitment towards academic output.
 Statistical forecasting and predictive trading indeed appeal to the mathematici
an in me, but the realization that at the heart of it all, financial transaction
s are simple and their goals fairly non-technical - is of great importance
 to me as a student of economics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At London Business School, I have researched the possibility of alpha-generation
 through a factor based on PPE ratios.
 In a course on Financial Engineering, I had explored market-value of risk
 in energy markets and commented on factors responsible for the decline
 of carbon trading markets.
 I have had brief exposure to issues in political economy through an study
 of investment opportunities in Burma.
 What I am looking for is an exposure to social research so that I can understan
d the trading behaviors and corporate finance better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My current goal for research in economics is driven by the need for inputs
 to investment and policy-making.
 With part-time studies I wish to address curiosities that haven't made
 to the public domain.
 Behavioral finance needs to interpret data from finance professionals -
 how individuals perform in response to events - and what type of differences
 may arise when inherent selection biases of an organizations can have difficult
y in implementation of policy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As someone trained in mathematics and computer science, I do believe that
 rationality should not limit themselves to interest rates - but explore
 psychology.
