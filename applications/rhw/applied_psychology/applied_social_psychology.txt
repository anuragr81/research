Why social psychology?
I intend to explore risk appetite in different subgroups - claiming whether certain groups of students based on geographical, cultural locations are more likely to aspire to mathematical trading to achieve monetary success. I want to test the hypothesis whether this is sufficiently explained by the relative household income of the subgroup.  I believe this would involved studying the levels of education in mathematics and surveying the current market of trading and investment professionals. I expect to leverage my own network of 1000+ individuals in the industry for data on educational and social backgrounds.

Everything I have done requires an appreciation of pscyhological biases and identifiying parameters of the audience. This is something I have never had an academic training - but my line of work has required me to appreciate the psychological biases in markets and audience. I wish to participate in studies and learn from the expertise that the university has.
