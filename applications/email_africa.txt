 am a student at London Business School and was interested in pursuing a PhD program at city university. The research project I have in mind attempts to identify conspicuous consumption in Africa - in comparison to other geographic regions -  and hopes to get inputs for policy and investments research. 
 
I am interested in the topic less from a development economics perspective than from a general utility theory perspective. If there is a possibility for you to advise me for a PhD in this area, I would love to know.  Any recommendations or suggestions otherwise would be equally helpful as well.
