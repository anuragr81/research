What is your career goal? 
My care goal is to research and implement statistical grounds for investment. I am aware that investment needs of the society are constantly changing and that there is no such thing as an all-seasons strategy. The investment needs are of interesting value when a factor is applied in different geographies and societies.

I have lacked a more immersion in social sciences. The interest in social research is not intended to limited to analyzing political risk in portfolios - but only a basic study to understand survey data and design of surveys to understand social attitudes. I would not rule out a possible approach in behavioral finance but my intention in this course to acquire an academic understanding of psychological concerns. I hope to expose myself more to the readings in  history and social sciense than applied mathematics - which has been the focus of my studies so far.
