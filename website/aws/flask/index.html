    <title>Research Interests - Anurag Srivastava</title>
  </head>
  <body>Welcome to the research homepage of Anurag Srivastava (<em>pronounced</em>:
    a-new-raag shrii-vaa-stav).
    <p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/economics/"

        title="Economics Reading">Economics department</a> at University of
      Reading. In my research, I use econometric methods to understand consumer
      demand and use stochastic methods in behavioural economics. I am intrigued by the approaches that attempt to unite micro-economic and applied macroeconomic approaches. I am advised by Dr <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/hedgehogs/about/staff/u-s-kambhampati.aspx"

        Drawn to technology more because of Bertrand Russell than Bill Gates, I
        have enjoyed theoretical computer science and take pleasure in writing
        automated proofs for topology and number theory (in python/lean). </li>
      <li><strong>Linguistics </strong>- Time permitting, I enjoy exploring
        grammars of ancient languages (Greek, Latin and Sanskrit) and their
        place in history and literature. </li>
