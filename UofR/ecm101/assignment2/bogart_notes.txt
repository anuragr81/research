1. The measures do vary - with raising public awareness to explicit prohibition
2. Saying that imposing sanctions on fat would improve healthy consumption of food is a bit like saying minimum wage would raise economic standard or ban on pornography assist rights of women. The root cause is not addressed.
3. Alcohol does present an interesting example with the attempts at its prohibition in the US.
4. Permit but discourage is a policy that seems to work
5. We don't want to fall in the trap Victorians did when they blamed gambling and alcholism as vices (of course, opium and yellow peril seemed to have laid the foundations of current criminalization of drugs).

6. Law has already changed from punishment to minimal control - instead of command and control, societies have turned to negotiation and persuasion.

Consider one example: cigarettes and bank deposits. In one program an individual trying to stop smoking opens a bank account. For six months she deposits the amount of money she would otherwise spend on cigarettes into the account. After six months she takes a test that determines whether she has been smoking. If she hasnâ€™t she gets to keep the money in the account; if she has the account is closed and the money is donated to charity. There is evidence that participating in this bank program increases the chance of quitting by over 50 percent, giving this initiative a much higher success rate than many other cessation efforts.96 (Nudge)

7.1. Nudge proponents Thaler, Sunstein also recommend driving courses instead of requirement of a helmet. This, may be, is going a bit too far. Obesity, however, is not a comparable example - the fear is mostly exacerbated by the interests of pharmaceutical companies, cosmetic surgeons and a new range of health-food producers.

It is also argued that weight gain was gradual and all across the board. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting-chemicals can cause diabetes. Race, Ethnicity are also a factor (AfAm,Lat are more likely in teenage years).

7.2. Some reasearch (Chritakis,Fowler on social contagian) points to catchability of healthy/unhealthy habits. 

7.3. Sedentary behaviours seem to contribute to obesity as well. Depression presents another dimension raises serious questions on data-accuracy.

7.4. The question that can be raised is that whether it is the increasing cost on obesity itself (through hip replacements and increased dietary monitoring) that causes concern about obesity? May be, other problems (psychological) have become classified under obesity.

7.5. It is well esablished that BMI itself is a flawed measure.

7.6. There are severe implementation issues with public awareness campaigns (since health-has-every-size campaign and the likes have a just cause). In fact, diets as volumetrics - who are recorded to have worked - show that any food can be a healthy food (eaten in moderation or if combined with healthier foods). There would a so-called appearance bias in media - which policies won't be able to do anything about.

(Seeman and Luciani are against government control)

8. Policies to prevent weight loss

8.1. Weight reduction policies have been largely a failure - Something like 95 percent of those who can lose weight regain the pounds shed, if not more, within five years (3:3).
8.2. Policy should be concerned with if it is targeting to prevent the stigmatization of fat people - as a side-goal to reducing obesity.

8.3. The several strategies to promote good eating/drinking and physical activity are more likely to have a greater impact, taken together, than any one of them individually.
