Insurance problem in Developing Countries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size footnotesize
A key feature of insurance is protection of risk-averse individuals who
 might be adversely affected by external phenomena.
 By pooling individual risks, insurance leads to Pareto-preferred states
 - enabling individuals to engage in risky activities which they otherwise
 won't.
 With risk of natural calamities and underdeveloped support as well as low-per
 capita income, developing countries are make a good case for insurance
 - more so if we consider that a labour-intensive agricultural sector is
 the primary sector of production in the developing countries.
 Still, it is often found that the costs and extent of administration in
 developing countries provide special challenges to provision of individual
 insurance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size footnotesize
It is observed that risk-aversion due leads to suboptimal selection for
 farmers in the developing world.
 This is observed in form of sharecropping or selection of low-risk crops.
 Rosenzweig and Binswanger
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 found that small farmers will choose to lower the risk of crop combination
 in order to reduce risk, cropping patterns that bring a higher income than
 the optimal combination of income from cultivation of lower 45% in India.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

As it turns out, however, this is not just a matter of cost.
 In other words, making administration cheaper wouldn't necessarily solve
 the developing world problems.
 It wasn't before Akerlof's influential paper, that information asymmetry
 became relevant to the insurance problem.
 The bad lemons problem in his influential paper, Akerlof wanted to present
 a

 In the paper, the bad lemons problem provided a way to measure the price
 of uncertainty.
 How good cars are driven out of the market by lemons (bad cars) and how
 senior citizens have trouble getting insurance is answered quite well

For the purpose of this writeup, other market failures and exogenous risks
 such as political risk and foreign-currency risks are ignored despite their
 importance.
 In our limited context, the limitation on risk-sharing networks in the
 developing world are due to i) limited information (lack of institutions,
 licensing, quality control) and ii) limited enforceability (less formal
 processes of judicial or administrative control).

Information Asymmetry - General Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\size footnotesize
Moral Hazard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size footnotesize
Moral hazard arises when customers do something that sellers don't know
 of.
 There is the possibility that the occurrence of some insurable event can
 be influenced by the unobservable actions of the individual.
 This incentive can be modeled.
 There is a clear problem is a farmer/participant doesn't want to put a
 lot of effort is s/he sees a certain income is guaranteed as the lower
 output performer (free-riding on high-output farmers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size footnotesize
If high efforts are with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and no efforts with 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, then expected utility with high efforts is 
\begin_inset Formula $pU(H)+(1-p)U(L)-c$
\end_inset

 while no efforts yield 
\begin_inset Formula $qU(H)+(1-q)U(L)$
\end_inset

.
 Without insurance, the farmer puts extra effort if 
\begin_inset Formula $pU(H)+(1-p)U(L)-c>qU(H)+(1-q)U(L)$
\end_inset

.
 With insurance, if farmers with H pool their harvests and with L receive
 a compensation, then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $pH+(1-p)L$
\end_inset

 assured for every farmer and since, 
\begin_inset Formula $U(pH+(1-p)L)>pU(H)+(1-p)U(L)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size footnotesize
The question that one may ask is how much insurance can be offered without
 worsening incentives? If perfect insurance conditions fails to hold we
 consider the second best-alternative.
 
\begin_inset Formula $pX+(1-p)Y=pH+(1-p)L$
\end_inset

 for farmer's output 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 High efforts are chosen as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $pU(X)+(1-p)U(Y)-C\ge qU(X)+(1-q)U(Y)\Rightarrow(p-q)(U(X)-U(Y))\Rightarrow C$
\end_inset

.
 Under the second best scheme, individual consumption must move with individual
 income.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size footnotesize
Considering, the reliability of a mutual insurance scheme, let us consider
 the gain from a high output individual who breaks the contract 
\begin_inset Formula $G=U(H)-U(M)$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $M=pH+(1-p)L).$
\end_inset

 The enforcement constraint would require that loss be higher than gain.
 So to not break the contract we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $L>G$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $U(H)-U(M)\le N[U(M)-\{pU(H)+(1-p)U(L)\}]+S$
\end_inset

 (social sanctions = 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

).
 This implies that large
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L-H$
\end_inset

 would encourage breaking of contract.
 If the possibility for self-insurance exists, then mutual insurance is
 likely to fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size footnotesize
Notice that provision of other health insurance (which may help with risk-reduct
ion) and thus reduce costs with netting of losses - are also affected due
 to wider moral hazard problems.
 Clearly, better administration has a huge monetary benefit.

Adverse Selection and Selection Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The term "adverse selection" was originally used in insurance.
 It describes a situation where an individual's demand for insurance is
 positively correlated with the individual's risk of loss.

 The survey data show that realized interest rates are lower and repayment
 periods are longer for debtor households who have experienced adverse shocks.

More puzzling is the almost complete absence of credit transactions which
 cross community boundaries.
 This is an environment characterized by seasonal demands for finance that
 are highly positively correlated over small areas, and the analysis above
 indicates that there is a large component of yield risk that cannot be
 insured against within the village.
 It would seem that there could be high returns available to financial intermedi
aries able to move finance over wide areas.22 The absence of direct lending
 from outside the community can be explained by the high information costs
 of such transactions and by the existence of village-based traders who
 provide financial intermediation

Consumption smoothing is an important motivation for gifts and informal
 loans, but gifts and loans are unable to efficiently share risk at the
 village level (gifts and loans take place not at the village level but
 within closed networks).
 Informal loans charge no interest; mutual insurance is largely confined
 to networks; and not all shocks are insured.
 Risk sharing takes place through repeated informal transactions based on
 reciprocity and mutual insurance takes place through a mix of gifts and
 no interest loans

Not all categories of shocks are equally insured, even within networks.
 Crop and livestock sales do not appear driven by a precautionary motive,
 nor do households seem to deal with shocks by increasing labor supply or
 drawing upon other sources of income.
 Financial savings, on the other hand, responds to shocks

 Even by the standards of poor rural economies, credit markets appear to
 be under-developed in rural China.
 Formal financial institutions seem uncommonly reticent to lend to poor
 people, particularly in remote rural areas, and there is little sign of
 the village money lenders that one finds throughout South Asia.
 The full insurance model is convincingly rejected on the Chinese panel
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size footnotesize
It is through these imperfect networks that the idea of a social capital
 comes about.
 These are powers exercised by the participants where formal lending doesn't
 exist.
 These are difficult to measure but indeed matter in a traditional society.
 Note that social capital doesn't always work in favour of insurance.
 It might in fact be impossible to provide insurance because they go against
 the established social norms or group identities.
 
\end_layout

Social capital also makes the modeling of enforceability difficult.
 The informal networks are used for rebuke and pressures of a kind not governed

One implication of the use of labor as insurance is that a household's vulnerabi

The correlation between poor harvests and the price of bullocks (the covariation

 Lim and Townsend (1998) suggest that covariant shocks and the nature of

 protecting them, and after carefully sifting through the same data, they
 uncover little evidence that is consistent with the Rosenzweig-Wolpin findings

Informal Gifts

Reciprocal gift giving is a common way to solidify social and economic relations
hips -and one potentially important form of informal insurance.
 In North China, for example, gifts are given to mark births, deaths, and
 weddings, as well as to help the elderly, the ill, and women who have just
 given birth (Kipnis 1997).
 Private transfers of cash, food, and clothing are large and frequent in
 some countries.
 For example, 40 percent of black South Africans reported either receiving
 or giving cash transfers (Cox and Jimenez 1997).
 Cash transfers reach large numbers of urban residents in Colombia (Cox
 and Jimenez 1998), Thailand (Paulson 1995), and the Philippines, where
 82 percent of urban and 89 percent of rural households report receiving
 transfers (Cox and Jimenez 1995)

A major result which we use is that a positive correlation between outcomes
 makes the mutual insurance difficult.
 At some level a positive correlation poses limits on how much mutual insurance
 is possible.
 If we consider two subgroups A and B that pay each other in times of trouble,
 then a trouble hitting both of them at the same time makes

 This presents a classic market failure in subgroups that are interdependent
 for reasons of locality or other criteria of interdependence.
 It gives us a certain of idea of the components of aggregate risk - that
 is common across all participants and an idiosyncratic risk for every participa
nt that cannot be aggregated or pooled (the participant can be an individual
 or the participating entity).

Groups with better access to information are in a better position to provide

New tests of informal insurance mechanisms relate the variability of total
 household consumption to income variability.
 If households can use coping mechanisms to "smooth" consumption somewhat,
 income should be more variable than consumption.
 Sharper testable implications can be drawn with respect to perfect consumption-
smoothing arrangements.
 If communities perfectly pool their incomes to share risks (and any given
 household's income is a small part of the total), the consumption level
 of a given household relative to its neighbors should be a function only
 of total community income and the household's assigned share of the total.
 The household's own income realization should then not affect consumption
 patterns, and all idiosyncratic risk (relative to village shocks) should
 be eliminated

Lund and Fafchamps, in particular, find that informal insurance arrangements
 are effective only in the case of young adults who are acutely ill; older
 adults who fall ill are far less likely to be helped.
 Lund and Fafchamps's data show that informal insurance also helps with
 funerals but not with crop failures, mild illnesses, or unemployment (other
 than that of the head of the family and his spouse).
 The household's social network also matters: households with more friends
 (especially richer friends) have a greater ability to use informal insurance.
 Households that are not so well connected fare much worse

Cox and Jimenez (1995) use household-level data from the urban Philippines
 to give a particularly striking example.
 They estimate that the receipt of net transfers from other households is
 particularly sensitive to whether the recipient is unemployed.
 The magnitude of the sensitivity is such that they conclude that if the
 government were to institute a simple unemployment insurance scheme, net
 private transfers to the unemployed would fall by 92 pesos for every 100
 pesos offered by the public program.
 In the end, the average unemployed worker would be better off by only 8
 pesos

The risk sharing apparent in monthly annual data is achieved by the buffer
 stocks of currency and crop inventory, and also by community institutions
 providing credit and insurance, but not at all by the purchase and sale
 of real capital assets and livestock.
 Still, by the more exact standards of full econometric tests and a priori
 plausibility none of the models seems to represent a satisfactory abstract
 picture.
 The complete markets model and permanent income buffer stock model do move
 us in the right direction, consistent with the data, but are rejected over
 all.
 The private information model fits much of the consumption data reasonably
 well, but it suggests a community control over assets which, though receiving
 mild support in the data, deserves further consideration.
 Apparent in the data are salient facts which should be part of subsequent
 model construction.
 The relatively rich tend to be high users of crop inventory, and these
 and other such users of crop inventory are more likely to pass full insurance,
 permanent income, and private information model tests.
 The relatively poor tend to be high users of currency, but these and other
 such users of currency are more likely to fail private information if not
 other model tests.
 The villages display both barter and monetary exchange.
 While virtually all households have access to credit and insurance, the
 efficiency of the creditrinsurance markets varies by land class, it is
 better for the larger land holders, and varies by village, it is worse
 for the more traditional village.

The penalties invoked by the authority also depend*on his position as a
 respected figure in the community.
 In many cases, the possibility that he might disapprove of one's activities
 is sufficient to prompt a potential defaulter to meet his obligations.
 The possibility that he might make his finding public, either to other
 authority figures or to the community at large (through gossip), is a stronger
 incentive to meet obligations.
 Both of these penalties apparently impose a cost on the defaulting party.
 If his honesty is impugned, the defaulter may be excluded from future credit
 transactions, and his ability to transact in other markets may be damaged
 as well.
 Private negotiation with (and admonishment from) an authority figure was
 the only penalty imposed on any of the sample households during the survey
 period; no dispute over loan repayments was made public

Linking credit with insurance can occur when insurance claim payouts are
 used as credit history.
 Insurance taking characteristics of credit is a key feature of developing
 markets.
 In Nigeria, for example, the credit market is not encouraged (the country
 being 90% Muslim) but the monetary arrangements are based on reciprocity
 and obligation.
 Interestingly, the probability of payment depend on financial position
 of the lender as well.
 The information asymmetry is hence addressed.

Wherever insurance markets are incomplete, credit markets are known to play
 an important role by allowing risks to be pooled over time; households
 borrow more when they suffer an adverse shock, and they lend more when
 favored with a positive shock

 The free flow of information within the village and among relatives may
 permit credit contracts to play a more direct role in insuring against
 risk.
 A striking finding is that repayments owed on a loan appear to depend upon
 the random production and consumption shocks received by both the borrower
 and the lender.
 Such state-contingent contracting would allow households to pool risk more
 efficiently and would permit credit transactions to conform to the Islamic
 prohibition of fixed interest charges.
 The easy availability of information implies that a lender need not engage
 in statistical inference in order to detect a default on a state-contingent
 contract, because the degree of compliance with the contract is known to
 both parties
