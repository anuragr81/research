CFG

If we were to write the siddhis using path-dependent chains, then a CFG formulation looks for appopriate. More precisely,

shaala aN - shaala aN - that leads to chha and chha becomes Iy.

It matters how we got at chha. chha is not necessarily a state - by itself unless we consider the state and the rule applied themselves as states.

The CFG option evaluates would add all possible tags to the sequence at any point and then evaluate the resultant through another set of rules. 

One simple way to do that is to let the state remember everything - for example - the last rule applied. The later rules can then see whether the rule applied affects their application or not. This may complicate things is there are too many rules to be considered.

Another way is to let rules be rules about sequences - and makes sure that the sequence represents the state as well as the rule applied.

In shaalaa Ngi chha - should remain in a format where it retains it's history so we'll have to define concepts like adarshana (lop), reduction, transformation etc. and then apply further reduction etc. only if reduction is through a certain path. This seems more structured - at least from a coding perspective - .
