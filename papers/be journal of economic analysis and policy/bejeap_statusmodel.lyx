\begin_layout Title
Status Consumption and Income Inequality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Status motivations for consumption have generated an immense interest at
 a time when social mobility has been relatively stagnant - but the consequences
 of inequality on consumption are still poorly understood.
 To explain status motivations under environments of income inequality,
 we treat opportunities for mobility as an explicit link between economic
 and social goals of the individual and focus on instances of status consumption
 where consumption can be viewed as an investment towards future economic
 success.
 The effect of relative incomes on the agentsâ€™ consumption and labour decisions
 is then explored in an economy with a dynamic hierarchy of rich and poor
 positions that participants are able to move between.
 Relying on diminishing returns to wealth utility - optimised by participants
 endowed with randomly distributed success-determining attributes - the
 results indicate that a rise in income inequality provides more incentive
 to participate in status competitions.
 As participants bear costs for the mobility, the equilibrium conditions
 suggest only two states in the long-run - one where both rich and poor
 strive for status and the other where only the rich participate in status
 competitions.

 at least as far back as

.
 While the post-war improvements in life-standards 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 have renewed an interest in positional concerns, the effects of economic
 inequality on status consumption remain unclear.
 On one hand, the post-war literature on status competitions attributes
 higher status consumption to a fall in income inequalities and improvement
 in life-standards

The literature in sociology (see 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{wegener1992prestigeconcepts}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for a discussion) suggests that one reason why such contradictions arise
 is that our attributions to status-differences do not always reconcile
 the subjective aspects of status (the effect of status differences on individua
l behaviour) with its objective aspects (the observed reality of status
 differences).
 Several studies in economics have since delved into subjective data on
 perception of status and inequality 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

cite{heffetz_visibility,MijsInequalityMobility2019,ZahraIndia}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The current paper attempts to reconcile the two aspects of status by assuming
 a specific link between economic and social goals and thus by allowing
 status to have an indirect (instrumental) effect on consumer wealth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992,postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Restricting the discussion to social capital investments that increase
 the chances for economic mobility (e.g.
 education, club memberships etc.), the paper views status competitions as
 games that provide direct gains to the participants as probabilistic economic
 rewards pertaining to status.

The relationship between economic and social goals of an individual are
 delineated using probability functions that determine a promotion to a
 richer economic class.
 Based on observations on status from 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{goode1978celebrationheroes}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the model allows the probability of promotion for the participant to be
 driven both by a set of fixed individual attributes and the investment
 in social capital.
 The status of the participant comes only from her accumulated wealth and
 is not directly factored into the utility (an approach similar to 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{ColeMaliathSocialNorms1992,postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 ).
 In the probabilistic game thus defined, the participants compete both with
 raw talent and acquired skills (social capital) to get promoted to (or
 to maintain) a rich position.
 More specifically, the winner of such a game is promoted to a rich position
 (or maintains her rich position) by having the maximum total score comprising
 both of raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (uniformly distributed in a population) and social capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (enhanced with expenditure).
 The model details the effect of income gaps on status consumption by then
 subjecting the expenditure on social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 to budget constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we explore long-term dynamics, the game comprises of two types of participant
s in the above view of status - the poor and the rich - so that the investments
 towards status (such as club-membership fees, or higher-education) increase
 the chances to be promoted to the rich status.
 The rich participants in the game or those who benefit with a higher disposable
 income (
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

) solely on grounds of their rich status while the poor participants are
 those who receive a disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Those who don't participate in the tournament face a loss of status, but
 those who do spend only benefit probabilistically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A useful analogy to explain such a competition is that of tennis leagues
 or golf tournaments - where rewards are risky but are unlike lotteries
 (i.e.
 more expenditure does not linearly increase one's chance to win).
 As with tennis or golf, participants with appropriate raw-talent and skills
 may exist naturally in a population but their success also depends on instituti
onal engagement with other players.
 More specifically, there may exist biological characteristics such as strength,
 dexterity, height or psychological attributes (resilience, conscientiousness
 etc.) that help one's success, but there also exist several characteristics
 such as technique, rankings, knowledge of equipment etc.
 that are only available at a significant cost to a participant.
 The enhancement of these latter skills (social capital) are what the expenditur
e-depending institutional support are meant to represent in the above probabilis
tic game.
 Several real-life status competitions are similar to such tournaments where
 interaction is small-scale as well as personal 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{goode1978celebrationheroes}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Such social capital investments have a significant role in real-life settings
 such as interviews, formal introductions or similar business interactions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of population-wide tournaments, the competitions considered above
 are small-scale and vary their criteria of success across multiple stages.
 The competitions are thus meant to be independent and vary only in the
 threshold participation cost and range of distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i},s_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the participants.
 The presented model considers a single instance of a competition with known
 distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 among a relatively small number of participants who exercise their choice
 to spend on social capital without an 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{a priori}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 knowledge of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 In a limited context of social capital investments, the results of such
 a model have implications on how inequality shapes investment decisions
 made with a perception of mobility and how such concerns may aggregate
 into macroeconomic trends.
 Indeed a necessary feature of the above formulation is that the results
 help separate the subjective aspects of status (how expectation of the
 future affects individual decisions) from its objective aspects (i.e.
 the reality of income differences due to status).

% Simply put, such competitions are more like an in-person job-interview
 than a nationwide examination for college-admissions.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A closed-form solution with a diminishing utility from wealth and a threshold
 level expenditure required for participants to spend (in order to avail
 social capital) suggests that there are only statues in the long-term equilibri
um.
 First, where the rich as well as the poor participant participates in the
 status competitions.
 Second, where only the rich participant engages in status competitions.
 In other words, the state where only the poor participate in status consumption
 is ruled out in the above formulation.
 Thus if the social capital investments were to be seen as an exchange between
 rich and the poor 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{GalbraithAffluent,HirschSocialLimits}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the competitions where poor strive for status must ultimately become infeasibl
e (except when relying thinly on a reference-dependent utility).
 While the poor may be incentivised for status, the long-term equilibrium
 is one where both poor and rich must strive for status - a result that
 seems aligned with the observations on positional consumption in the post-war
 era 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{HirschSocialLimits,FrankPond}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The model also explains how participation costs - along with higher income
 differences - have a key role to play in the rise or decline in social
 capital investments (e.g.
 education or network-building activities).
 More particularly, social capital investments are likely to be subject
 to a discouragement through high participation costs while still being
 incentivised in an environment of higher income differences.

While status is often contrasted as a social goal rather than the economic
 goal of an individual, the difference between social and economic goals
 remains unclear in both sociology and economics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The idea that status is orthogonal to economic goals - or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

pure status
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 view - seldom fits with the real-world where status both contributes to
 income and improves with rises in income 
\begin_inset ERT

cite{moldovanuselacontestsstatus2007}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Indeed the other extreme view that the economic goals alone motivate status
 competitions - so that status is derived purely from economic rewards is
 also unrealistic.
 As 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

 argue, the reality is often somewhere in between the two extremes.
 
\begin_inset ERT

 if there were no interdependence between status and consumption or labour
 decisions.

 The dominant view for status in both sociology and economics has been based
 on hierarchy and social deference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ColemanSocialTheory1990,goldthorpesociology2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 - a view that is inherent in occupational status surveys widely used in
 empirical studies (e.g., the EGP classes or the Goldthorpe class scheme).
 A fundamental problem that the sociology literature has elaborated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wegener1992prestigeconcepts"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is the failure to reconcile the difference between objective aspects of
 status (the observed reality of status differences) and its subjective
 aspects (the effect of status differences on individual behaviour).
 An evident issue with addressing only the objective aspect of status using
 a utilitarian model while leaving the subjective aspect exogenous is that
 status may never be explained in economic terms when an economy for status
 is ruled out.
 It is not surprising therefore that while the discussions on status rely
 on a deference-based view of status, the subjective (private) evaluations
 of status in empirical studies end up measuring an overall desirability
 of occupations or education instead

\begin_layout Standard
The issue also makes it difficult to answer whether inequalities can have
 a negative or positive effect on status consumption or not.
 On one hand, the post-war literature on status competitions argues that
 a fall in income inequalities and improvement in life-standards has resulted
 in a higher focus on status goods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithAffluent,GalbraithBeyondContentment1994,GalbraithEssential"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, the empirical literature often finds status consumption
 to increase with rising inequality.
 In a study focusing on education expenses for status purposes in China,
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{JinLiInequalityStatusConsumption2011}

\end_inset

 find, for example, that higher inequality increases the consumption towards
 status.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{JaikumarConspConIneq}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 also report that consumers in India have increased conspicuous consumption
 with rise in inequality.
 An appropriate line of research has been to examine the environment where
 inequality is experienced (often relying on social attitudes surveys).
 
\begin_inset ERT

 use the data from International Social Survey 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 to detail how a rise in inequality might have cemented a belief in meritocracy
 in the developed economies and coincided with segregation rather than a
 healthy competition.
 Since the environment where inequality is experienced comprises both of
 the objective and subjective notions of status, a link between the two
 provides us a model to better understand the effects of inequality on status
 consumption.

The presented approach explores a particular link between social and economic

 by social institutions 
\begin_inset ERT

 This is contrasted against notions of status based on tradeable-power in
 an economy 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 - a view that has also been criticised due to its inherent assumption of
 there being a fixed total amount of status in society 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Instead of using status as a wealth-determined goal, the presented approach
 follows 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citeA{postlewaite1998socialbasisinterdeppreferences}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in considering status only of an indirect role in maximisation of wealth
 utility.
 More specifically, the rank of the participant (rich or poor status) does
 not directly contribute to utility and but matters only through a higher
 income that contributes to maximisation of the participant's expected wealth
 utility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the view of status as an economic goal that corresponds to a
 possible future monetary benefit to the participant - rather than a non-monetar
y utility - is unlike the view of status signaling used in many studies
 on conspicuous consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This is primarily because the utility from status consumption in the empirical
 studies on conspicuous consumption is treated both necessarily futile and
 entirely separable from a private (non-visible) utility.
 Our specific consideration of status - an approach that equates the social
 goals of the participant with her long-term economic goals - bears more
 similarity with the approach followed by 
\begin_inset ERT

In the status game that selects the winner to be maintained at the rich
 position, only two characteristics matter for every individual.
 The first is the social capital that can be enhanced with expenditure by
 the individual participant and the second is a raw-talent that cannot be
 changed with higher expenditure.
 Both skill 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (enhanced with expenditure) and the raw talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 (which cannot be changed with higher expenditure) are assumed to be uniformly
 distributed in the population.
 Assuming the weight 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 of raw-talent in the maximum total score considered for the win in a competitio
n, consider the preferences for the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 ( where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is raw-talent and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 are skills that are available with higher expenditure) under the assumption
 that the population remains constant over time (there are the same number
 of rich and poor in total) and that the participants are not aware of their
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 before participating in the competitions.
 In other words, the rich participants are replaced by either a rich or
 poor participant only through the tournament that selects highest combined
 score regardless of rich or poor background of the participant.
 Since all participants can participate in every such tournament, it is
 possible for a rich participant to lose her rich-position and let another
 participant acquire her position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is assumed that the preferences for all poor participants are the same
 as are the preferences of all the rich participants.
 Having a rich or a poor status by itself only has an indirect effect (through
 higher expenditure or budget) on the chance to be promoted (or maintaining
 one's rich position) - a probability that otherwise depends on the individual
 ability 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 All rich participants and all poor participants having the same behaviour
 also means that the individual attributes 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and

 - which are not known to the participant - are not used to decide upon

 uniformly distributed, the likelihood of any participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,N]$
\end_inset

 can be formulated as the probability for their total score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}+(1-\mu)s_{i}$
\end_inset

 being higher than any other participant - where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 is a parameter that combines social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 so that the participant with maximum score 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu r+(1-\mu)s$
\end_inset

 wins the competition.
 The winner of the competition acquires a rich position so that she obtains
 the disposable income 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$

 while the loser acquires the poor position receive 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$

\begin_layout Standard
To start with a simpler case, consider that in a competition with raw-talents
 alone, the winning participant is one who has the maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 drawn from the sample 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the winner in a competition of raw-talents is a player
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{r_{i}<r_{j}\forall i\in[1,N]\}$
\end_inset

 and the probability that a given participant 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of raw-skill 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the winner is essentially that of all other players 
\begin_inset Formula $j\ne i$
\end_inset

 having ability 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{j\ne i}$
\end_inset

 less than 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the probability 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a uniform distribution of skills 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[0,1]$

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $P(r_{i}\ge r)=r_{i}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in[1,N]$
\end_inset

 and therefore, the probability is evaluates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}{(r_{i})^{N-1}}dr_{i}=\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

.
 With more players, the chances of a particular participant winning evidently
 declines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Introducing the skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 which are curated in social institutions, we consider a threshold investment
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 which is necessary to be spent for the social capital to be available to
 a participant.
 While this is an arrangement that evidently favours the rich participant,
 there are also diminishing returns to investing 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 towards the richer position if naturally occurring raw talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 is also significant in the competition.
 To direct our focus on conditions when social capital is more important
 than raw-talent, it assumed in the foregoing analysis that raw-talent is
 less valued than skills cultivated by institutions

In the game where a participant

\begin_inset Formula $N-P$

 to be filled in every competition.
 The expected behaviour of the rich and the poor participants in the long-term
 can be explained with four different cases.

With Case I, the poor participant can win when her raw-talent (weighted

\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 as the total score of the rich participants (who compete with acquired
 skills).
 The poor are priced out of accessing any skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$

 have skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s>0$

 Thus, a given poor participant must be ahead both of all of the poor participan

\begin_inset Formula $\mu r_{i}$

With the uniform density for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$

\end_inset

 ), total probability to win can be calculated as
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}$
\end_inset

 Since the participants do not know the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 before they participate in such competitions, the total probability can
 be evaluated with the assumption that both 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 range from 0 to 1.
 Notice also that since only one participant can win the skills-game, the
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}P_{2}(\text{win}|r_{i},s_{i})ds_{i}dr_{i}$
\end_inset

 for a rich participant to win is simply

In Case II, when the rich person has no access to social capital (i.e.
 all rich participants have

 to win for the poor participant

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

In Case III, when neither the rich nor the poor participate in the game,
 then the game depends only on raw-talents and all participants have the
 same probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

 to win the game.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{N}}{N}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{N}$
\end_inset

Using symmetry arguments, this winning probability - which is the same for
 all participants - also turns out to be 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

 for all the participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that with the rich and poor participants having disparate incomes
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

), the above setup evidently puts the poor participants at a disadvantage
 since they may not afford to pay the costs to enhance their skills (i.e.
 realise the true worth of their skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 due to high participation costs).
 However, since both raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and social-capital 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 (the latter enhanced by costly institutional support) are randomly distributed
 in the population, the competition may never rule out the chance for a
 poor participant to win.
 For the same reason, the returns from investments to enhance one's skills
 may also be diminishing since one cannot beat raw-talent and non-enhanced
 skills after a certain point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising also that the effect of expenditure on the winning
 probability is weakened with higher number of participants in the game
 where abilities (both skills 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 relevant for social capital and the raw-talent 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

) are uniformly distributed.
 In other words, if poor and rich participants were to be considered as
 two separate groups, then the effect of expenditure on their wins declines
 when more and more participants are sampled with varied raw-talents and
 skills.

 The probability that the total score

Case III 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case III, when neither the rich nor the poor participate in the game,
 then the game depends only on raw-talents and both participants have the
 same probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 to win the game.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{r_{i}=0}^{r_{i}=1}P(\text{win}|r_{i})dr_{i}=\frac{r_{i}^{2}}{2}|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 Both the poor and rich participant have the same total probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Case IV
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Case IV, when both rich and poor participants set 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, then the poor participant can win only if her score 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is above that of the rich participant.
 Therefore, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
P(\text{win}|r_{1},s_{1})=P(\mu r_{2}+(1-\mu)s_{2}<\mu r_{1}+(1-\mu)s_{1})\\

\end{multline*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P(\text{win}|r_{1},s_{1}) & =\begin{cases}
\frac{x_{1}^{2}}{2\mu(1-\mu)} & 0<x_{1}<\mu\\
\frac{x_{1}-\mu/2}{1-\mu} & \mu<x_{1}<1-\mu\\
1-\frac{(x_{1}-1)^{2}}{2\mu(1-\mu)} & 1-\mu<x_{1}<1\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this integral can be evaluated based on symmetry arguments ( since
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$

), the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<1/2$
\end_inset

 - indicating that curated skills are given more importance that raw-talent
 in the competitions - means that the poor participant is strictly better
 off (than facing probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

) if she participates while the rich participant doesn't participate (Case
 II).
 Also, the poor participant is better off participating for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu<\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 when the rich participant does participate as it raises the probability
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

.
 That the competition becomes uncompetitive both when threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 falls too much (letting both participants participate) or rises too much
 (letting both participants withdraw) also follows from the properties of
 the winning probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the rich participant could withdraw and face either 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 or lower probability (when the poor participant participates).
 By participating, therefore, the rich participant would either face probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 (when poor participant also participates) or better (if the poor participant
 withdraws).
 Considering the probabilities alone, the rich participant would always
 participate.
 If the rich participant always participates, then so long as budget constraints
 permit, the poor participant is also better off participating since not
 participating brings her probability to win below 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

.
 If the utility was from probability alone, then both participants would
 participate and face 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it's not the probability to win that the participants optimise
 (maximise).
 A more accurate representation of the real-world is a game where participants
 face a finite life-time and utility from accumulated assets instead.
 Thus, what follows is the case where the participants optimise an intertemporal
ly additive utility over their life-time.
 The life-time in the model is represented with two time-horizons - where
 the second-time horizon is one before the end of life when all wealth accumulat
ed by either participant must disappear.
 With no accumulations at the end of life, both rich and poor participants
 must decide to spend all their incomes 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 (for poor and rich participants respectively so that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

) towards the promotion game.
 In the first-stage, however, the participants decide the amount to be spent
 towards promotion based upon the utility from wealth they obtain across
 the two time-horizons that span their lifetime.
 For the poor participant, the total utility to be optimised (assuming EUT)
 under the intertemporally additive utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\cdot)$
\end_inset

, a winning probability function 
\begin_inset Formula $W(x)$
\end_inset

 (for expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

) and a discount-factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(y_{1}-\nu_{1})+\frac{1}{\delta}((1-W(y_{1}))u(y_{1})+W(y_{1})u(y_{2}))
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, for the rich participant, the total utility to be optimised (assuming
 EUT) is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(y_{2}-\nu_{2})+\frac{1}{\delta}((1-W(y_{2}))u(y_{1})+W(y_{2})u(y_{2}))

 As we can verify from Figure

 that we have

 represents the condition when the budget is non-binding i.e.
 the poor participant is able to spend 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}<y_{1}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 When the poor participant faces a binding constraint i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

 , then the rich participant knows that the best case probability to win
 for the poor participant is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$

 The rich participant's decision to participate would depend only on utility
 from savings and the relative advantage from gain in probability.

Since the number of poor participants is likely to be higher than that of
 rich participants in a typical competition, the unequal number of poor

Assuming EUT participants, consider the simpler case of binding constraint
 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}<y_{2}$
\end_inset

 first .
 With the assumption of a stability in long-term participant behaviour (which
 itself is a result of observed probability of success), mixed-strategies
 are not considered relevant in the current set up.
 Considering pure strategies for participation, the rich participant would
 thus participate only when the utility from participating would be higher
 than from not participating i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})+\frac{p_{2}u(y_{2})+(1-p_{2})u(y_{1})}{\delta}>u(y_{2})+\frac{u(y_{2})+u(y_{1})}{2\delta}$
\end_inset

 .
 This results in the following condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{(p_{2}-1/2)(u(y_{2})-u(y_{1}))}{\delta} & >u(y_{2})-u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With income differences being the same an increase in participation cost
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 discourages participation since RHS increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\because u(y_{2}-\overline{\nu})$
\end_inset

 is decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

) and may fail the above condition.
 Similarly, with participation cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 being the same, an increase in income-difference 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 is in the rich participant's interest whereas a narrowing of income differences
 reduces incentive for the participant to participate by possibly failing
 the above condition.
 All else being the same, higher impatience (lower time-discounted value
 of money or a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

) would also discourage participation.
 Therefore, when budget is binding for the poor participant i.e.
 if the poor participant cannot participate due to 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}<\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, then narrower income differences, higher participation costs and higher
 patience for savings (common for both rich and poor participants) all encourage
 the rich participant to withdraw from the game.
 This also means that wider income differences (
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

) combined with lower participation costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

) may together help maintain the equilibrium where only the rich participates.
 Similarly, wider income differences ( higher 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}-y_{1}$
\end_inset

 ) and more patience for savings (higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

) would together maintain the incentive for the rich participant to participate.
 These conclusions very much fit with the sociological observations made

Consider now that conditions for Case I to be a Nash Equilibrium.
 If Case I were to be a Nash equilibrium, then for the rich participant's

 withdrawing than from participating and for poor participant's decision
 to withdraw, the rich must get more utility from participating than from
 withdrawing.

 An increase in

 In other words, a higher

 favours the equilibrium (Case I) so long as there is an incentive for the
 rich to participate.
 Likewise, a decrease in

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U_{1}}{u(y_{2})-u(y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 by raising the stakes enough for the poor to participate (making it less
 likely for first inequality to be fulfilled).
 It is easy to see that higher impatience 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 encourages both poor and rich to withdraw.
 As would be evident, the equilibrium conditions corresponding to Case II
 are far more stringent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Case II is a Nash Equilibrium, then for rich's decision to withdraw,
 the poor participant should get more utility from participating than from
 withdrawing and for poor participant's decision to participate, the rich
 participant should get more utility from withdrawing than from participating.
 This means that the following hold 
\begin_inset Foot

\end_inset

 , the above cannot be satisfied so long as we have a diminishing utility
 which necessitates 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{2}<U_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus an equilibrium with Case II which incentivises the poor to participate
 but not the rich is possible only with a reference dependent utility with
 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}<U_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}<U_{2}$
\end_inset

\frac{U_{1}}{u(y_{2})-u(y_{1})}<\frac{(p_{1}'-1/N)}{\delta}<\frac{(1/N-p_{2}')}{\delta}<\frac{U_{2}}{u(y_{2})-u(y_{1})}
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that despite a reference-dependent utility, a higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

 or more impatience (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

) may disincentivise the poor from participation just the same (leading
 to Case III).
 Similarly, higher income differences (an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2}$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

) could encourage the rich to participate by decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U_{2}}{u(y_{2})-u(y_{1})}$
\end_inset

 (leading to Case IV).
 Even with the reference dependent utility, the equilibrium with Case II
 remains a fragile one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Case III were to be a Nash-Equilibrium, then for rich participant's decision
 to withdraw, poor should get more utility from withdrawing than from participat

 The following should thus hold

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}'-\frac{1}{N}\le p_{2}-\frac{1}{N}$

\begin_inset Formula $U_{2}<U_{1}$

 A higher

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Higher income differences i.e.

\end_inset

 and incentivise the rich participant to participate (leading to an equilibrium
 with Case I).
 Conversely, if the game is not lucrative for the rich it would automatically
 be infeasible for the poor i.e.
 if rich withdraws then poor automatically withdraws.
 If there is any net utility from playing the game, however, Case IV is
 the likely equilibrium.
\end_layout

If Case IV were to be a Nash Equilibrium, then for rich's decision to participat

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{2}<U_{1}$

 , this equilibrium rests upon the incentive for the poor participant to
 participate.
 So long as the poorer participant finds the competition worthwhile, the
 rich would also participate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results outline how participation costs influence the investments
 towards status.
 For very low 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, rich and poor would both participate and for very high 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\nu}$
\end_inset

, both would withdraw.
 For everything in between, the only equilibrium with a diminishing utility
 from wealth is one where rich participate whereas poor don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above framework also allows us to discuss the implications of inequality
 for the same total wealth in the economy.
 As such, a segregation where the poor never participate in the status economy
 seems less favourable than one where both rich and poor participate in
 the status competitions.
 The current chapter explains that the likely outcome of a failure to maintain
 universal participation in status games (under diminishing utility from
 wealth) is that of a segregation where only the rich participate in skills
 leading to economic success.
 While a reference-based utility (which may be encouraged with segregation)
 does seem to permit an equilibrium where only the poor are concerned with
 status games (with respect to skills-enhancement), the result only suggests
 that a segregation of status games along with that of incomes is another
 possible long-term outcome of limited participation.

\begin_layout Standard
The paper considers a model where status amounts to a position maintained
 by the participant's social capital investments.
 It uses a decision theory framework for uncertainty inherent in status
 considerations and investigates the role of income gaps on expenditures
 that carry some status while also having an effect on the income mobility
 of the participants.
 The endogenisation of status in this manner allows an understanding of
 the role of income gaps in a generic framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above model provides three important details pertaining to status-expenditur
es in an environment of income inequalities.
 First, there are only two long-term states of the poor-rich relationship
 that exist for status competitions under a diminishing wealth utility -
 one where both rich and poor participate in status competitions and another
 where only rich stand to benefit from status competitions.
 The particular detail demonstrates how income differences limit the benefit
 from status competitions to the poor - providing a quantitative basis for
 observations on social limits to growth in the literature 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
cite{HirschSocialLimits,GalbraithBeyondContentment1994,GalbraithAffluent}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 More specifically, while poor may be incentivised with status in a setting
 where status is exclusive to the rich, the other long-term equilibrium
 is one where both rich and poor must strive for status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second detail highlighted by the model is the interplay of participation
 costs (threshold) and income-differences in status competitions.
 The model explains how a withdrawal from expenditures such as education
 could be the result of a combined effect of both participation costs and
 income-differences.
 More specifically, high participation costs push the equilibrium to one
 where only rich participate in status-related competitions while high income
 differences may continue to incentivise the poor to participate.
 In other words, reducing income-differences without lowering of participation
 costs in status competitions may have an effect of supporting status-games
 under long-established inequalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third detail is the role of a reference-based utility - which serves
 as a caveat to the effects of income-differences on status expenditures.
 The model shows that contentment at lower levels of wealth could support
 segregation of competitions at different income levels in the economy.
 In other words, status competitions could be feasible despite vast income
 differences so long as the utility depends on local levels of wealth.
 This also seems in line with many of the findings from subjective contentment
 data on belief in meritocracy amdist inequalities

\begin_layout Standard
To calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{s=0}^{s=1}\int_{r=0}^{r=1}P(\text{win}|r,s)drds$
\end_inset

 over the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $0<r<1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0<s<1$
\end_inset

), we evaluate the sum of three parts split by the boundaries of the piecewise
 function.
 The three parts are shown in Figure

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\mu r+(1-\mu)s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

 is of the following piece-wise form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
F(x) & =\begin{cases}
A & 0<x<\mu\\
B & \mu<x<1-\mu\\
C & 1-\mu<x<1\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\begin_layout Standard
Then the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{s=0}^{s=1}\int_{r=0}^{r=1}F(x)drds$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{s=0}^{s=1}\int_{r=0}^{r=1}F(x)dsdr & =\int_{r=0}^{r=1}{\int_{s=0}^{s=\frac{\mu(1-r)}{1-\mu}}A\ dsdr}+\int_{r=0}^{r=1}{\int_{s=\frac{\mu(1-r)}{1-\mu}}^{s=1-\frac{\mu r}{1-\mu}}B\ dsdr}+\int_{r=0}^{r=1}{\int_{s=1-\frac{\mu r}{1-\mu}}^{s=1}C\ dsdr}
