1. PERSPECTIVE - Things like logon should have come out of the discussion - a perspective that is lacking. Partly it is the fault that no active user communication exists - but this was supposed to have come out through each one of you. Market binary hasn't been run - we're trying to deploy it - but it has taken way too long. This is how it typically should have worked:
  i)   Activity Diagram - User logon - How does this translate into classes. 
  ii)  Test Cases - how do we check if the user can send all information? 

  This is the table we're going to use.
  || Activity || Artifact || Completion Criteria ||
 
2. INDEPENDENCE - This goes in with the completion criterion. If you don't go through the completion criterion - your task is not completed - and would be reopened by the person monitoring your progress. Other than that you ought to be independent, if there is something that you don't know - you would be assigned another activity. If you don't know shell-script for example, you would be assigned to get an understanding of shell-scripting - the criterion of completion is that of a sub-task.
